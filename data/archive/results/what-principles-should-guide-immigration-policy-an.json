        "reasoning": "Although the PVC-selected statement discusses a common theme of hard work and respect for laws, it does not adequately bridge different perspectives. It focuses primarily on values of hard work and honesty, but does not incorporate perspectives of inclusivity, diversity, and compassion that were also present in the discussion. Moreover, it does not represent a reasonable consensus as it leans towards a stricter approach, neglecting the more progressive and empathetic views shared by some participants. Therefore, it does not capture the essence of the discussion effectively."
