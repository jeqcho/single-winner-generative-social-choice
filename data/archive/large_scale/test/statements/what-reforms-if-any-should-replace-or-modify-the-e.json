I would keep the Electoral College, but I\u2019d be open to modest reforms\u2014like making the process more transparent and tightening rules on \u201cfaithless electors\u201d\u2014so people can better understand and trust how their votes are translated into the final result."

    "statement": "At my age, having lived through many elections both in Ireland and here in the States, I\u2019ve come to feel the Electoral College no longer reflects the will of the people. I\u2019d like to see it replaced with a national popular vote so that every ballot, whether cast in a big city or a small town, counts equally. If that\u2019s politically out of reach, then at least states should allocate electors proportionally instead of winner\u2011take\u2011all, so candidates have to earn broad support rather than just focusing on a handful of swing states."

    "statement": "I think the Electoral College should be changed so that the popular vote matters more, because it feels unfair that someone can win the presidency without getting the most votes. Maybe we could keep parts of it but make it so electoral votes are divided based on how people in each state actually vote, instead of winner-take-all. That way, everyone\u2019s vote would feel like it counts, including people in smaller states like Wisconsin."
