    "statement": "As someone who values law and order and has seen a lot in my 86 years, I believe we must support our police while still expecting them to be properly trained and held to clear standards. There should be strong, consistent training on de-escalation and fairness so officers treat everyone with respect, but they also need the tools and backing to respond firmly when there is real danger. I think local communities, including seniors like me, should have regular, respectful dialogue with police so concerns about bias and force can be addressed before problems grow. This way we can preserve public safety without abandoning our moral responsibility to treat people justly."

    "statement": "As someone who has spent a lifetime caring for people as a nurse and now volunteers in my community, I believe policing should focus on de-escalation, strong mental health partnerships, and real accountability when force is misused. We need rigorous bias training, body cameras, and independent oversight so that communities\u2014especially people of color\u2014can trust officers to protect them rather than fear them. At the same time, officers should be well-supported, well-trained, and held to clear standards, so they can keep everyone safe without resorting to unnecessary violence."

    "statement": "I think police should have to follow really clear rules about when they can use force, and they should wear body cameras so everyone can see what actually happened. They should also get better training on handling tough situations without violence and on understanding people from different backgrounds. At the same time, we still need enough officers to keep neighborhoods safe, especially for kids and families, so it\u2019s about making policing fairer and more respectful, not getting rid of it."
