    "statement": "As someone who spent my life caring for patients and their families, I believe laws concerning abortion should prioritize a woman\u2019s health, dignity, and autonomy, guided by medical evidence rather than religious doctrine or partisan politics. Decisions about pregnancy are deeply personal and often agonizing, and I don\u2019t think the government should interfere with what a woman decides in consultation with her doctor and those she trusts. At my age, I\u2019ve seen the harm caused when safe options are restricted, so I support legal, accessible abortion with appropriate medical safeguards, not moral judgment imposed by the state."

    "statement": "I think laws about abortion should try to protect the life of the baby as much as possible, because I believe life is sacred and a gift from God, like we learn at church. At the same time, they should also make sure the mom is safe and supported, especially in really serious situations like when her life is in danger or in cases of rape. Lawmakers should listen to doctors, parents, and faith leaders, and focus on compassion instead of just politics."
