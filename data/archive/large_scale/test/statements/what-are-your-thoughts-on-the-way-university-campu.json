    "statement": "As someone who has lived through many painful chapters of history, I believe university administrators must firmly protect students\u2019 rights to protest while drawing a clear line against harassment, threats, and dehumanizing language toward any group. They should create structured, well-facilitated spaces for dialogue\u2014bringing in historians, conflict-resolution experts, and voices from both Israeli and Palestinian communities\u2014so that passion is channeled into learning rather than intimidation. Administrators also need to be transparent in their decisions and consistent in their policies, so no side feels singled out or silenced. Above all, they should prioritize the safety and dignity of every student while encouraging empathy, critical thinking, and nonviolent engagement."

    "statement": "I think campus administrators should let people protest about Israel and Gaza as long as it stays peaceful and doesn\u2019t turn into bullying or threats against any group. Everyone should be able to share their views and stories, but there need to be clear rules so students still feel safe going to class and walking around campus."
