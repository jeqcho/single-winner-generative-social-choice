We need strong, transparent public rules to keep AI from deepening inequality or spreading harmful misinformation, with democratic oversight, independent audits, and clear accountability when things go wrong."

    "statement": "I think artificial intelligence should be used mainly to help people learn faster, cure diseases, and make everyday tasks easier, not to replace humans or make us lazy. Since powerful AIs could be dangerous if they\u2019re misused, I believe governments, tech companies, and regular people should work together to set strict rules, test systems carefully, and be honest about how AI works. We should make sure AI respects human dignity and never takes away people\u2019s basic rights or chances to work and create."
