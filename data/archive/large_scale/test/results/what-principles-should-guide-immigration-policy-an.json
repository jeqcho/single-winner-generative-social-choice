We should prioritize family unity, humane treatment at the border, and opportunities for work, education, and civic participation, while still doing reasonable background checks to keep people safe. A modern, compassionate system would recognize the reality that immigrants are already caring for our sick, raising families, and enriching our culture, and it should give them a straightforward way to fully belong."
