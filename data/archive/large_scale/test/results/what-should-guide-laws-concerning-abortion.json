The decision should ultimately rest with the pregnant person in consultation with their healthcare provider, with the law ensuring safe, accessible care and protecting individual rights, not imposing one group\u2019s moral beliefs on everyone else."

At the same time, they should also make sure the mother is safe and supported, especially in really serious situations like danger to her life or cases of rape. I don\u2019t think it should be treated like just another medical choice, but something very serious that people, families, and doctors think deeply about."
