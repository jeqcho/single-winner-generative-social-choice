    "statement": "As someone who spends a lot of time outdoors and cares about evidence-based policy, I think the best way to prevent littering is a mix of smart design and behavioral nudges rather than just harsher punishment. We should make disposal incredibly convenient (well-placed bins, clear signage, and recycling options), pair that with small but consistently enforced fines, and run public campaigns that frame not littering as a social norm and civic responsibility. Data from environmental psychology and public health suggests that when people see clean, well-maintained spaces and clear expectations, they\u2019re far less likely to treat those spaces like a dumping ground. In other words, if we engineer the environment thoughtfully and back it with science-driven policy, we can dramatically cut litter without relying solely on punitive measures."

Cities and towns should enforce fines for littering and actually follow through, while also making sure there are enough trash and recycling bins in parks, sidewalks, and public areas. Schools and churches can teach kids early about taking care of their community so it becomes a habit, not something the government has to nag us about. We all want clean streets and safe places for our kids to play, and that starts with each person picking up after themselves."
