In my view, the line should be drawn where expression moves from the realm of exchanging ideas, however offensive, into targeted actions that create a credible threat to others\u2019 safety and equal participation in public life. Within those bounds, even deeply objectionable views are better confronted and discredited through open discourse rather than suppressed."
