    "statement": "As an attorney and a feminist, I view data collection as a consent and power issue: tech companies should treat user data like a fiduciary trust, not a free-for-all asset. They must provide genuinely informed, plain-language consent options, strict limits on secondary use, and meaningful opt-out rights, especially for vulnerable and marginalized users. Monetization should be transparent and auditable, with users having a real stake\u2014whether through control, compensation, or both\u2014and companies should face serious legal consequences when they exploit or mishandle personal information."
