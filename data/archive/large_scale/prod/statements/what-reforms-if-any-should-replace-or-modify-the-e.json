    "statement": "Given how much technology and data we now have, the Electoral College feels like an outdated mechanism that distorts the principle of \u201cone person, one vote.\u201d I\u2019d prefer a national popular vote with some form of ranked-choice voting, so every ballot directly shapes the outcome and third-party or independent candidates can participate without being spoilers. As someone who came to the U.S. from India and works in a data-driven field, the current system\u2019s reliance on a handful of swing states looks both statistically inefficient and structurally unfair. Reforming it would make the system more representative and reduce the sense that some votes matter far more than others."

The current system distorts campaigns toward a handful of \u201cswing\u201d states and discourages broad-based civic participation, particularly among younger and marginalized voters whose voices we desperately need in a healthy democracy. A carefully designed national popular vote\u2014with uniform voting standards, robust protections against disenfranchisement, and strong safeguards for election integrity\u2014would be a more honest reflection of the Catholic social principle that every person\u2019s dignity, and thus every vote, counts the same."
