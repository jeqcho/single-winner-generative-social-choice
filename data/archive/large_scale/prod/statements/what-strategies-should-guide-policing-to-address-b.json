    "statement": "As a Nicaraguan Muslim who believes in social justice, I think policing needs to be rooted in accountability, transparency, and genuine community partnership, especially in immigrant and minority neighborhoods. Departments should adopt strict use-of-force standards, require body cameras and independent review of misconduct, and invest heavily in de-escalation and anti-bias training, while redirecting some responsibilities\u2014like mental health crises\u2014to specialized responders. This kind of approach doesn\u2019t weaken public safety; it strengthens trust, so officers can do their jobs more effectively and communities feel protected rather than targeted."

    "statement": "As someone who has spent a lifetime studying power, authority, and social order in ancient civilizations, I am acutely aware of how unchecked force corrodes legitimacy. Modern policing must be guided by strict, transparent accountability measures, de-escalation training, and independent oversight to identify and correct bias, especially racial bias. At the same time, officers need robust support, training, and community collaboration so that public safety is secured through trust and partnership rather than fear. A society that tolerates arbitrary or discriminatory use of force is not stable in the long term; it is simply postponing deeper conflict."

It seems important for police to build real relationships with neighborhoods, not just show up when something goes wrong, so trust can grow on both sides."
