    "statement": "As someone who\u2019s seen how hard regular people work just to get by, I think rebuilding trust in our elections starts with making voting easier, more transparent, and clearly secure for everyone, especially in Black communities that have a long history of being sidelined. We should expand early voting, make Election Day a holiday, invest in auditable paper trails, and ensure nonpartisan oversight so people can literally see how ballots are handled and counted. At the same time, we need strong laws against voter suppression and better civic education, so folks know both their rights and how the system actually works. When the process is open, fair, and visible, people are more likely to believe their vote truly matters."

    "statement": "As someone who has studied how ancient societies rose and fell, I find it alarming how easily trust in our own democratic process can be eroded by misinformation and partisan manipulation. To increase public confidence in U.S. elections, we need more uniform, transparent national standards for voting and counting, robust nonpartisan oversight, and clear public communication about how ballots are secured and audited. We should also invest in civic education so citizens understand both the mechanics and the historical importance of free and fair elections, rather than relying on rumor or social media narratives."

To increase trust in elections, we should make voting easier and more accessible\u2014like more early voting, automatic voter registration, and clear language access\u2014while also being fully transparent about how ballots are counted and audited. We also need strong protections against voter suppression and gerrymandering so communities like mine actually feel represented.

    "statement": "I think one way to increase trust in US elections is to make the whole process more visible and understandable, especially for young people like me who can\u2019t vote yet but are already affected by the results. Schools could teach more about how ballots are counted and let students observe or volunteer in non-partisan ways when they\u2019re old enough, so it doesn\u2019t feel mysterious or rigged. Also, having clear, easy-to-find information online about how votes are verified and what safeguards exist\u2014explained in simple language\u2014would help people see that the system is being checked carefully and fairly."
