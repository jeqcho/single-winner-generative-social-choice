I believe the government has a responsibility to guarantee universal access to healthcare as a public good, not a privilege tied to employment or income, by providing a robust baseline of coverage that no one can fall below. Private options can exist on top of that, but no one in a country as wealthy as ours should be forced to skip treatment, ration meds, or delay a nurse visit because they\u2019re worried about the bill. Ensuring universal access isn\u2019t just morally right\u2014it also keeps our communities stronger, healthier, and more stable in the long run."

From a pragmatic standpoint, a universal system would reduce administrative waste, improve public health, and free people to change jobs or start businesses without fearing the loss of coverage. As a Christian and a Democrat, I see this not just as smart policy, but as a moral obligation to care for the well-being of everyone in our community."

    "statement": "As a relatively healthy 25-year-old with private insurance, I still think it\u2019s messed up that access to a doctor in this country depends so much on your job, your bank account, or your luck. I believe the government should guarantee universal healthcare as a basic right, funded publicly but open to private options on top, so no one has to choose between getting treatment and paying rent. That aligns with my Buddhist values around reducing suffering and my politics as a Democrat: a wealthy society should make sure everyone can see a doctor, not just people with good employer plans."

    "statement": "Having spent a lifetime studying ancient societies, I am acutely aware that civilizations are ultimately judged by how they treat their most vulnerable members. In a country as wealthy as the United States, it is both a moral obligation and a practical necessity for the government to guarantee universal access to healthcare as a basic right, not a privilege tied to employment or income. I support a strong, publicly funded system that ensures everyone can receive essential care, with room for private options on top, because a healthy population is foundational for a just, stable, and truly modern democracy."

    "statement": "As someone who works in a hospital and sees patients struggle to afford basic tests and treatments, I strongly believe the government should guarantee universal access to healthcare as a fundamental right, not a privilege. A wealthy country shouldn\u2019t have people choosing between paying rent and getting the care they need, especially in communities of color that are already hit hardest by health inequalities. The government should fund and regulate a system that covers everyone, regardless of income, immigration status, or job, while making sure hospitals and clinics have the resources to treat people with dignity and quality care."

Since I\u2019ve always had health insurance, it\u2019s hard to imagine not being able to see a doctor when you need one, and that feels really unfair. I don\u2019t know exactly how all the policies should work, but I feel like the government, doctors, and communities should work together so people don\u2019t avoid getting care just because they\u2019re scared of the cost."
