I don\u2019t want government micromanaging private medical decisions, yet I also don\u2019t think abortion should be treated casually or used as a substitute for personal responsibility.

    "statement": "Laws concerning abortion should prioritize a woman\u2019s right to make decisions about her own body, guided by medical expertise rather than political ideology. As a progressive Protestant, I see compassion, privacy, and respect for individual conscience as central religious values, so I support keeping abortion legal, safe, and accessible while also investing in education, contraception, and social supports that reduce the need for it."

    "statement": "At my age, having seen how delicate life is\u2014whether it\u2019s a nesting bird or a young woman in trouble\u2014I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, respect for women\u2019s autonomy, and a sober understanding of real-world circumstances. Government should set basic safeguards for health and late-term viability, but decisions early in pregnancy should largely be left to the woman, her conscience, her doctor, and her God."
