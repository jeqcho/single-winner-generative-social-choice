    "statement": "As someone who has spent a lifetime studying how past civilizations flourished or collapsed, I see artificial intelligence as a powerful tool that should be harnessed to expand knowledge, improve education, and address collective problems like climate change and inequality. But history teaches that unregulated power, whether in the hands of kings or corporations, leads to abuse; AI must therefore be governed by strong public institutions, transparent oversight, and democratic input, not left solely to private interests."

    "statement": "AI should be used to make life fairer and safer for everybody, especially in hospitals and healthcare, where it could help catch diseases earlier and ease the load on overworked staff like me. But it has to be tightly regulated so it doesn\u2019t discriminate against people of color, immigrants, or low-income communities, and ordinary workers shouldn\u2019t be thrown aside just because a machine is cheaper. We need strong laws, transparency, and community oversight so AI serves human dignity and equality, not just corporate profits."

Since I care a lot about art, I\u2019d want AI to be a tool that supports artists, not something that copies their work without permission. There should be strict rules so companies have to be honest about how their AI works, protect people\u2019s data, and make sure it\u2019s not biased or used to harm others. I also think regular people, including students like me, should have a say in how AI is used, not just governments and tech companies."

    "statement": "I see artificial intelligence as a powerful tool that, if guided well, can free people up to focus more on creativity, care, and community\u2014kind of like how a good set of tools transforms a workshop. But it has to be governed with strong public oversight, transparency, and regulations that put ordinary people, workers, and civil rights first, not just corporate profit. We ought to treat AI like critical infrastructure: democratically controlled, audited for bias and safety, and shaped to reduce inequality rather than deepen it."
