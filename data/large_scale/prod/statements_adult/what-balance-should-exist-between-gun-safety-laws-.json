The Second Amendment matters a lot to me, and I don\u2019t think responsible gun owners should be punished or overregulated because of what criminals do. At the same time, I\u2019m fine with background checks, safety training, and keeping guns out of the hands of clearly dangerous people, as long as those measures are clear, limited, and don\u2019t turn into backdoor bans. The goal should be to respect individual freedom while making sure people are handling that responsibility as safely as possible."

    "statement": "I grew up around responsible gun owners and I respect the Second Amendment, but I also believe rights come with responsibilities to our communities. I think we should have thorough background checks, safe storage requirements, and better mental health support, while still allowing law-abiding citizens to own firearms for self-defense, sport, and tradition. To me, it\u2019s about common-sense guardrails that prevent avoidable tragedies without turning gun ownership into a political football. If we approach this with moderation instead of extremes, we can protect both public safety and individual freedoms."

The Second Amendment is part of the American constitutional fabric and should be respected, but it was never meant to be a suicide pact that prevents us from enacting rigorous background checks, safe-storage requirements, and restrictions on weapons designed for mass killing. From my perspective, a civilized society has every right\u2014indeed, an obligation\u2014to regulate dangerous tools in the interest of public safety, just as we do with cars, medicines, and building codes. We dishonor neither liberty nor history by insisting that gun ownership be responsible, traceable, and as safe as reasonably possible."

To me, real freedom means being able to walk in my neighborhood or go hiking without worrying about getting shot, and smart gun safety laws are part of making that a reality."
