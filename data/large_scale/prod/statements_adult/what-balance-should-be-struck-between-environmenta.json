Climate policy should put strict, science-based limits on emissions and ecological harm, and then channel innovation, public investment, and market incentives into building a clean-energy economy that creates high-quality jobs and shared prosperity. In other words, we ought to accept short-term costs and structural changes now to avoid far greater social and economic losses later, while explicitly prioritizing justice and equity in who benefits and who\u2019s protected."

Climate policy ought to treat environmental protection as the foundation of any healthy economy, not an optional extra, even if that means slowing or reshaping certain kinds of growth. We should invest in green jobs, conservation, and renewable energy so people can make a living without destroying the habitats and species that make life rich and livable. True prosperity is measured in clean air, safe water, and thriving ecosystems, not just in profits and GDP."
