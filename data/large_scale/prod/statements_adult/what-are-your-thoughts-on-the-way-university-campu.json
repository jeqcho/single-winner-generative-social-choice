    "statement": "University administrators need to protect free speech and peaceful protest, even when views are polarizing, while drawing a firm line at harassment, threats, or disruption of others\u2019 ability to learn. They should create structured, moderated spaces for dialogue\u2014teach-ins, forums, facilitated discussions\u2014so students can engage with the complexity of Israel/Gaza rather than retreat into slogans or online echo chambers. Transparency in policies and consequences is crucial so no group feels singled out, and administrators must be especially attentive to the safety and dignity of Jewish, Palestinian, Muslim, and Arab students, all of whom may feel uniquely vulnerable in this moment."

Peaceful demonstrations about Israel and Gaza should be allowed, even vigorously and passionately, but lines need to be clear and enforced when rhetoric turns into harassment, intimidation, or targeting people based on identity. Administrators should create structured forums for dialogue, bring in diverse experts, and be transparent about policies instead of reacting only when things explode. That kind of consistent, principled approach is the best way to honor academic freedom while keeping campuses safe and inclusive for everyone."

People have a right to speak their minds about Israel and Gaza, but they don\u2019t have a right to disrupt other students\u2019 education or make Jewish or Muslim kids feel unsafe on campus. If the rules are broken, the school should enforce consequences quickly and consistently, without playing politics."

They should be transparent about their policies, apply them fairly to all sides, and create spaces where Palestinian, Israeli, Jewish, Muslim, and other students can express their pain and perspectives safely. Universities should also use this moment to actually educate\u2014host teach-ins, panels, and dialogues\u2014so it\u2019s not just about shutting protests down but helping students understand the history and human cost behind the conflict."
