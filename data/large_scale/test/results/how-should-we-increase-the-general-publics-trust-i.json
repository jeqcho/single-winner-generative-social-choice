We should also keep politics out of the counting process as much as possible, with bipartisan observers in every step and timely, straightforward reporting of results so people don\u2019t feel things are happening behind closed doors."

I\u2019d also like to see stronger action against misinformation, and more civic education in our communities, so people understand the system instead of just hearing rumors."

If people could see for themselves that the rules are fair and the results are checked by both parties, they\u2019d be more likely to trust the outcome, even when their side loses."
