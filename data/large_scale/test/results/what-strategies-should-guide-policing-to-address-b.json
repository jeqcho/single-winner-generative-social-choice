We should invest in de-escalation training, body cameras, and community-based policing so officers know their neighborhoods and are less likely to rely on force. At the same time, departments need to back good cops, weed out bad ones quickly, and make sure policies are enforced fairly, not driven by politics or the loudest voices on social media. That balance\u2014firm enforcement of the law with respect for every citizen\u2014is the best way to reduce bias and excessive force while keeping our communities safe."

Necesitamos mejor entrenamiento en control de impulsos, trato respetuoso y conciencia de prejuicios, junto con c\u00e1maras corporales y revisiones claras de los casos de fuerza excesiva. Al mismo tiempo, los oficiales deben sentir que la comunidad y el gobierno los respaldan para enfrentar el crimen sin miedo a represalias injustas. El objetivo debe ser simple: una polic\u00eda firme pero justa, que respete a todos y haga cumplir la ley sin favoritismos."

      "statement": "As someone who values law and order and has seen a lot in my lifetime, I believe we must support our police while also holding them to high professional standards. Officers should receive strong training in de-escalation and fair treatment of all people, but we must not undermine their ability to act decisively to keep communities safe. I think better screening, ongoing education, and clear accountability for misconduct can reduce bias and excessive force without demonizing the many good officers who risk their lives every day."

      "statement": "As someone who\u2019s lived nearly a century, I\u2019ve seen how unequal treatment by police can shatter trust, especially in communities that already feel marginalized. We need stronger de-escalation training, independent oversight of use-of-force cases, and clear accountability when officers cross the line, while also investing in mental health professionals and community programs to handle situations that don\u2019t require an armed response. Public safety is best protected when officers see themselves as partners with the community, not an occupying force, and when every person\u2014no matter their background\u2014is treated with dignity and fairness."

At the same time, I still want them to be able to protect us from dangerous people, so there should be clear rules and body cameras to make sure officers do their jobs the right way. It would also help if cops did more positive stuff in neighborhoods, like talking with kids at schools and community events, so people can trust them more instead of being scared of them."
