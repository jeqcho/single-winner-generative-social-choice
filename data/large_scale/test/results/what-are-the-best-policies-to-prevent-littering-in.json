Just as important, though, is community education and engagement\u2014bringing schools, local groups, and volunteers together to teach respect for our shared spaces, much like we care for a patient or a home kitchen, so everyone feels proud enough of their neighborhood not to leave it in a state."

There should also be clear signs and real consequences, like fines or community service, for people who still litter, because it\u2019s not fair to everyone else who wants clean streets and nature. Schools and churches could help teach kids early on why taking care of the environment matters, so it becomes a habit instead of just a rule."
