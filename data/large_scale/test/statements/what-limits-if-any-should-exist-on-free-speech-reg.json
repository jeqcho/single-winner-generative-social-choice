    "statement": "I believe free speech is a core American value and should be protected very strongly, even when the words are ugly or offensive. However, speech that directly calls for violence or clearly threatens people should be stopped, because that\u2019s no longer just talk, it\u2019s dangerous. I came to this country for its freedoms, and I don\u2019t want the government deciding what we\u2019re allowed to say, but I do think we must hold people accountable when their words put others in real physical danger."

    "statement": "Having lived through a fair share of history, I\u2019ve seen how hateful words can fuel real harm, especially against vulnerable groups, so I believe there must be limits when speech directly incites violence, harassment, or discrimination. People should be free to criticize ideas, religion, and politics, but speech that targets people for who they are and encourages others to threaten or attack them crosses a line. As someone who values community and dignity for all, I think our laws and social norms should protect open debate while firmly restricting speech that clearly endangers others\u2019 safety and equality."

    "statement": "I think people should be allowed to say what they believe, even if it\u2019s unpopular, because free speech is important for learning and understanding each other. But if speech turns into direct threats, bullying, or trying to stir up violence or hatred against a group of people, then there should be limits, because that can seriously hurt others and tear communities apart. As a Catholic, I believe everyone has dignity, so speech that clearly aims to dehumanize or intimidate others shouldn\u2019t be protected the same way regular opinions are."
