    "statement": "As someone who grew up under communism in Poland, I take the Second Amendment very seriously and believe law\u2011abiding Americans should not be punished or overly restricted for the actions of criminals. At the same time, I support common\u2011sense safety measures like background checks and proper training so that guns are handled responsibly and kept out of dangerous hands. The right to self\u2011defense is important, but it should be exercised with responsibility and respect for human life."

    "statement": "Having lived nearly a century and worked as a nurse, I\u2019ve seen far too many lives cut short, and I believe we owe it to our communities to treat guns with at least the same seriousness we treat public health. The Second Amendment doesn\u2019t have to mean a free-for-all; it can and should coexist with strong, common-sense regulations like universal background checks, safe storage requirements, and limits on weapons designed for mass killing. To my mind, real freedom includes the freedom to go to school, church, or the grocery store without fear of gun violence."
