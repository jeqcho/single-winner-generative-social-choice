    "statement": "As someone who grew up in a very different time, I believe tech companies have a moral duty to treat people\u2019s information with the same care a bank treats their money. They should be completely honest about what they collect, get clear permission before using or selling it, and never share it in ways that could harm people or their families. I don\u2019t think the government should control everything, but there should be firm rules so these companies can\u2019t take advantage of ordinary folks who don\u2019t understand all the fine print."

    "statement": "I think tech companies should have to be super clear about what data they collect and exactly how they use it, in normal language that kids and parents can actually understand. Since they make money off our info, they should protect it like it\u2019s something valuable we\u2019re lending them, not something they own. They also shouldn\u2019t be allowed to track or target kids without strict limits and real permission from parents, because that feels creepy and unfair."
