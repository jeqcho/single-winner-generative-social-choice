    "statement": "I believe the best way to keep our public spaces clean is to enforce existing laws more strictly and make sure people face real fines when they litter. At the same time, we should teach children from a young age\u2014at home, in church, and in school\u2014that caring for our surroundings is a matter of personal responsibility and respect for others. Clear signage, enough trash bins, and community clean-up days can also remind people that these spaces belong to all of us and should be treated with care."

    "statement": "At my age, I\u2019ve seen how a bit of care\u2014or neglect\u2014can change a neighborhood, and litter is one of those small things that makes a big difference in how people feel about a place. The best policies mix practical steps\u2014plenty of bins, regular clean-up crews, deposits on bottles and cans\u2014with education in schools and community campaigns that make keeping our streets clean a shared value, not just a rule. I\u2019d also support fines for repeat offenders, but paired with community service so people have to help clean the very spaces they\u2019ve disrespected. When everyone feels some ownership of our parks and sidewalks, from the children to the retirees like me, littering becomes socially unacceptable, not just illegal."

    "statement": "I think the best way to stop littering is to have more trash and recycling bins everywhere and make it super easy to use them. Schools and communities should also teach kids from a young age why littering hurts animals, the environment, and even how our neighborhoods look and feel. There should be clear fines or consequences for people who still litter on purpose, because it\u2019s not fair for everyone else who cares and tries to keep public spaces clean."
