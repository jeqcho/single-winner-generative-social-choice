We need strong environmental protections as the foundation, and then we build economic growth on top of that by investing in clean energy, green jobs, and resilient communities. Climate policy shouldn\u2019t be framed as jobs versus the planet; it should be about creating decent, sustainable work that keeps our air, water, and climate safe. If we\u2019re clever and compassionate about it, protecting the environment can be the engine of a fairer, more prosperous economy, not a brake on it."

    "statement": "I think protecting the environment has to come first, because if we ruin the planet there won\u2019t be any economy left for my generation or the kids after us.

If we invest in green jobs and new inventions, we can help the Earth and still let families have good lives."
