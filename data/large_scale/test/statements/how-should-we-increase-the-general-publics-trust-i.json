    "statement": "At my age, having lived through quite a few election cycles here and back in Ireland, I\u2019ve learned that trust comes from transparency and neighbors talking to neighbors, not from shouting on television. We should expand nonpartisan poll worker programs and invite more ordinary citizens, including retirees like me, to observe and help run elections, while clearly explaining voting procedures and security measures in plain language. I\u2019d also like to see stronger protections against voter intimidation and disinformation, so people can vote without fear and with good, accurate information. If folks can see with their own eyes that the process is fair and well run, they\u2019ll be far more likely to accept the results, win or lose."

    "statement": "I think people would trust elections more if everything about them was easier to see and understand, like putting all the rules, security steps, and results in simple language online so anyone can check them. It would also help if schools taught us how voting and counting really work, and if both political parties agreed on fair rules ahead of time instead of arguing about cheating only when they lose."
