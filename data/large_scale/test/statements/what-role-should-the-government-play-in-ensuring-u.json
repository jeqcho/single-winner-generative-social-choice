    "statement": "At my age, having worked as a nurse for decades, I\u2019ve seen too many people delay care or skip medicines because they couldn\u2019t afford them, and it breaks my heart and my sense of fairness. I believe the government has a responsibility to guarantee universal access to healthcare as a basic right, funded through taxes, so no one is left choosing between rent, food, and seeing a doctor. A wealthy country like ours can and should ensure that everyone, regardless of income or job, can get the care they need without fear of financial ruin."

    "statement": "I think the government should make sure everyone can get basic healthcare, because nobody should have to skip the doctor just because their family doesn\u2019t have enough money. My parents work hard and we have insurance, but I know not everyone is that lucky, and it doesn\u2019t seem fair that kids could get really sick just because of cost. The government should at least cover important stuff like emergencies, checkups, and vaccines, and then families who want more can choose extra coverage if they can afford it."
