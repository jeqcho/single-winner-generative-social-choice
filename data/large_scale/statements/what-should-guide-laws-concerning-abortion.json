    "statement": "Laws concerning abortion should prioritize a woman\u2019s right to make decisions about her own body, in consultation with her doctor, rather than politicians or religious authorities. Having seen many complicated medical situations as a nurse, I believe safe, legal access to abortion is essential healthcare, and each person\u2019s circumstances and conscience must be respected. In a diverse, democratic country, our laws should protect individual freedom and public health, not impose one moral view on everyone."

    "statement": "I think laws about abortion should try to protect unborn life as much as possible, because I was raised Catholic and taught that life is sacred from the beginning. At the same time, they should also make sure the mother is safe and supported, especially in cases like danger to her life, rape, or serious health problems. Lawmakers should listen to doctors, parents, and faith communities and try to balance compassion for the mother with respect for the baby."
