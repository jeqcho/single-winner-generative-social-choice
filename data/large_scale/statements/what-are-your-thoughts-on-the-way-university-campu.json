    "statement": "As someone who\u2019s lived through many conflicts and seen the cost of dehumanizing \u201cthe other,\u201d I believe university administrators must protect students\u2019 rights to protest while drawing a firm line at harassment, threats, and discrimination of any kind. They should create clear, consistently enforced guidelines that allow passionate advocacy for Palestinians and Israelis alike, while also investing in facilitated dialogues, teach-ins, and mental health support so students can process grief and anger constructively rather than turning on one another."

    "statement": "I think campus administrators should let students protest about Israel and Gaza as long as it stays peaceful and nobody is threatened or harassed. People should be allowed to express their beliefs, but the school also has to make sure everyone feels safe going to class, no matter what side they\u2019re on or where they\u2019re from."
