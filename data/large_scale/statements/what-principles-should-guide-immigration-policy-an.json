    "statement": "As someone who came to this country from Ireland and worked my whole life as a nurse, I believe immigration policy should be rooted in fairness, compassion, and respect for human dignity. We should have a clear, accessible path to citizenship for people who work hard, follow the law, contribute to their communities, and want to make this their home, just as I did. Our system ought to protect refugees and families, avoid needless cruelty, and recognize that immigrants strengthen our society economically, culturally, and morally."

    "statement": "I think immigration policy should be fair and organized, so people who want to come here and work hard, follow the rules, and respect our laws have a clear path to citizenship. At the same time, we should protect our borders and make sure everyone is safe, but not treat people like they\u2019re less human just because they\u2019re from somewhere else. As someone who\u2019s Catholic and likes learning about other cultures, I believe we should show compassion and give families a real chance to build a better life here."
