    "statement": "As someone who spent her life as a nurse, I\u2019ve seen too many good people delay care because they couldn\u2019t afford it, and that\u2019s simply wrong in a country with our resources. I believe the government has a responsibility to guarantee universal access to healthcare, funded fairly through taxes, so that everyone\u2014no matter their age, income, or job\u2014can see a doctor, get their medicines, and receive hospital care without fear of financial ruin. A strong public system can still work alongside private options, but the basic promise of care should not depend on your wallet."

    "statement": "I think the government should make sure everyone can get basic healthcare, because nobody deserves to get really sick or die just because their family doesn\u2019t have enough money. My family has insurance, but I know not everyone does, and that doesn\u2019t seem fair, especially for little kids. The government should at least cover essential stuff like checkups, emergency care, and medicine, and then people who want more can pay for extra through private options."
