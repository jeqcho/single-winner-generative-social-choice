    "statement": "At my age, I\u2019ve seen what happens when short-term profit trumps long-term care\u2014whether it\u2019s for patients or the planet. We need strong climate policies that put environmental protection first, while supporting workers and communities through a fair transition to cleaner industries. Economic growth that destroys the very air we breathe and the land we live on isn\u2019t real progress. We\u2019re clever enough as a society to invest in green jobs, renewable energy, and public health so that both the economy and the environment can thrive together."

    "statement": "I think we should protect the environment even if it means slowing down some types of economic growth, because if the planet gets too messed up there won\u2019t be a good future for anyone\u2019s jobs or money anyway. But I also get that families need to afford stuff and towns need businesses, so climate policies should help create new kinds of jobs, like in clean energy, instead of just shutting things down."
