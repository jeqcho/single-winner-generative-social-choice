    "statement": "At my age, I\u2019ve seen far too many families shattered by gun violence to believe that \u201cdoing nothing\u201d honors the Second Amendment. I respect that many Americans cherish the right to own a firearm, but with rights come responsibilities, and we desperately need strong universal background checks, safe storage requirements, and restrictions on weapons designed for mass killing. To me, that\u2019s not taking freedom away\u2014it\u2019s using a bit of common sense and compassion to protect our neighbors, just as I tried to do as a nurse."

    "statement": "I think people should be allowed to own guns because the Second Amendment is part of our country\u2019s history and how some families protect themselves, but there need to be strong safety rules so kids and innocent people don\u2019t get hurt. Things like background checks, safe storage laws, and training requirements seem fair, because they don\u2019t take guns away from responsible owners, they just help prevent tragedies."
