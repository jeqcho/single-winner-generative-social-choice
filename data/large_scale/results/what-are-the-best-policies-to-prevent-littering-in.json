We should have plenty of visible trash and recycling bins, meaningful fines for littering that are actually enforced, and community-led clean-up efforts that get people invested in taking pride in their neighborhoods. I also believe businesses and local churches can partner with local government on \u201cadopt-a-street\u201d programs, so everyone has some skin in the game. In the end, you change behavior not just with laws, but by building a culture where leaving a mess behind is seen as unacceptable."

Cities should enforce strict fines for littering and make examples of people who don\u2019t follow basic rules, while keeping trash cans and recycling bins clearly available. Schools, churches, and community groups should also teach young people to take pride in their neighborhoods, because good habits and respect for others start at home and in the community, not in a government office."

We also need public education that speaks to community pride and environmental responsibility, starting early in schools and reinforced through local campaigns. I\u2019d like to see businesses and event organizers held accountable too, with requirements for waste management plans and incentives for reducing single-use packaging.

Teaching children in schools and churches to respect shared spaces is also important, because good habits start young. Public places should be cared for just like our own homes."
