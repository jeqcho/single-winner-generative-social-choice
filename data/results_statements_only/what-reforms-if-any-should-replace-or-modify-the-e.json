It is important to remember the original intentions behind it, balancing powers across states regardless of their population. However, I am not adverse to considering modifications that uphold these principles while ensuring every citizen's voice is effectively represented, drawing on the same trailblazing spirit that I apply in creating new culinary experiences from traditional recipes."
