    "Preserve the federal character of presidential elections while ensuring every vote carries more equal weight by phasing in reforms like proportional allocation of electors or a well-designed interstate popular-vote compact. Pair any change with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, recounts, and protections against faithless electors so outcomes are transparent, trustworthy, and encourage candidates to campaign broadly rather than just in a few battlegrounds.",
    "Balance respect for smaller states with democratic legitimacy by keeping state-based administration but ending winner-take-all distortions through district or proportional allocation and expanding tools like ranked-choice voting. Complement institutional tweaks with nationwide safeguards\u2014uniform counting rules, routine audits, and automatic recount triggers\u2014so the system is fair, auditable, and widely accepted across regions.",
    "Move toward outcomes that reflect the national popular will while preserving regional voice by adopting an interstate compact or proportional electoral rules as a transitional path, combined with measures that protect rural and small-state influence. Strengthen trust with consistent standards for voter access, secure balloting, nonpartisan redistricting, and clear elector obligations so reforms improve legitimacy without causing abrupt disruption.",
    "Seek a middle ground that respects federalism but reduces the sense that a handful of swing areas decide elections by promoting proportional or district-based elector allocation and phased adoption of a national popular-vote mechanism. Reinforce any change with robust, uniform election protocols\u2014paper ballots, audits, recount rules, and protections against manipulation\u2014so all communities feel heard and results are defensible.",
    "Craft reforms that make presidential elections more representative without discarding the state role: favor proportional electors or a compacted popular-vote approach, layered with ranked-choice voting to reward broad support. Anchor reform in nationwide standards for access, security, and transparent counting so outcomes are trusted, campaigns reach more places, and smaller communities continue to have meaningful influence.",
    "A workable path forward is to preserve the constitutional role of states while reducing winner-take-all distortions\u2014through options like proportional or district-based elector allocation, a carefully designed interstate popular-vote compact, or ranked-choice mechanisms that reward broader support. Any change should be phased and paired with uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so outcomes are transparent, trusted, and protect smaller communities from being ignored.",
    "Bridge reforms should balance federalism and equal representation by keeping states central to administration while ensuring the national voice matters\u2014examples include proportional electoral allocation, the National Popular Vote compact with geographic safeguards, or nationwide ranked-choice voting. These changes must be accompanied by uniform voting standards, reliable audits, and anti-gerrymandering rules so elections are fair, auditable, and widely accepted.",
    "A balanced reform approach would make every vote feel meaningful without abruptly discarding state roles: adopt proportional or district-based electors, encourage an interstate popular-vote agreement, and pilot ranked-choice ballots to foster majority support. Pairing any shift with clear federal baseline rules for access, counting, and audits will protect smaller communities, reduce swing-state fixation, and strengthen public trust in results.",
    "Practical reform should aim for outcomes that reflect the popular will while preserving meaningful regional voices\u2014through measures like proportional allocation of electors, a conditional national popular-vote compact, or ranked-choice voting to reward broad coalitions. Crucially, reforms must include uniform election standards, secure paper ballots, and robust audits so changes increase legitimacy rather than polarization.",
    "Seek common ground by modernizing how electors are awarded\u2014moving away from pure winner-take-all toward proportional or district methods or a phased interstate popular vote\u2014while strengthening uniform safeguards like recount rules, audits, and anti-gerrymandering protections. This dual focus preserves the federal structure that protects smaller states and improves fairness, transparency, and incentives for candidates to campaign across the whole country.",
    "Preserve the federal role in presidential elections while making outcomes feel fairer by phasing in reforms that reduce winner-take-all distortions\u2014such as proportional or district-based elector allocation or an interstate popular-vote compact\u2014paired with uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. Complementing those measures with tools like ranked-choice voting and stronger anti-gerrymandering rules can encourage broader, cross-regional campaigning and protect smaller communities without abruptly discarding the constitutional framework.",
    "Balance the goal of equal voting weight and the need to protect smaller states by adopting a gradual, state-led approach: require consistent national baseline rules for secure, transparent elections while giving states options to allocate electors proportionally or join a compact that honors the national popular will. Paired with reforms like ranked-choice voting and independent districting, this path builds trust, rewards broad coalition-building, and limits the power of a few swing areas.",
    "A workable reform blends respect for federalism with democratic fairness\u2014keep state-administered elections but reduce all-or-nothing outcomes through proportional or district methods and encourage an interstate popular-vote agreement once robust uniform safeguards exist. Strengthening nationwide standards for access, audits, and recounts, plus adopting ranked-choice voting where feasible, will make every ballot feel meaningful while protecting rural and small-state voices.",
    "Find common ground by modernizing rather than abolishing the Electoral College: pair nationwide baseline rules for secure, transparent voting with state options to allocate electors more proportionally or to join a trusted national popular-vote compact. Adding ranked-choice ballots and independent redistricting incentives helps ensure winners reflect broad support and that communities large and small remain heard.",
    "Bridge competing concerns by prioritizing legitimacy and stability\u2014establish uniform election safeguards and phased reforms that reduce winner-take-all effects (like proportional allocation, district methods, or an interstate popular-vote compact) while protecting smaller-state influence. Combine these changes with measures such as ranked-choice voting and stronger auditing to foster broad turnout, cross-regional campaigning, and public confidence in results.",
    "Preserve the role of states in choosing the president while making every ballot feel equally meaningful by moving away from winner-take-all allocations toward proportional or district-based electors and supporting a carefully phased interstate popular-vote compact where feasible. Pair these changes with uniform baseline standards for ballot access, transparent audits and recount rules, and optional ranked-choice voting to encourage broader, majority-minded coalitions and reduce sharp incentives to focus only on a few swing areas.",
    "Modernize the system with a pragmatic blend: keep federalism\u2019s protections for smaller states but require clearer, uniform rules for election administration and auditability while shifting electoral awards toward proportional splits or a national popular vote compact implemented gradually. Complement that shift with safeguards\u2014automatic recount thresholds, anti-gerrymandering measures, and optional ranked-choice ballots\u2014so reforms increase legitimacy without abrupt disruption.",
    "Seek common ground by ensuring the winner reflects the broad popular will while protecting geographic diversity: require electors to follow certified state results, encourage proportional or district-based allocation of electoral votes, and support an interstate popular-vote agreement once strong national standards for access, security, and audits are in place. These paired steps\u2014plus ranked-choice options to secure majority support\u2014can reduce winner-take-all distortions and build bipartisan confidence in outcomes.",
    "Move toward a more direct, trustworthy outcome by adopting either a national popular-vote mechanism or proportional allocation of electors, but only alongside enforceable, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, and post-election audits and with phased implementation to protect smaller-state voices. Emphasize transparency, nonpartisan administration, and voting methods that promote majority support so reforms broaden participation and lower incentives for contested results.",
    "Balance equal representation and federal stability by ending pure winner-take-all practices in favor of proportional or district-based electoral allocation, or by enacting a national popular vote compact backed by strong, nationwide safeguards; at the same time institutionalize uniform rules for voting access, audits, and recounts and consider ranked-choice voting to ensure winners have broad support. A gradual, bipartisan transition with clear protections for rural and small-state concerns will help sustain legitimacy and reduce polarization.",
    "A practical bridge is to align the presidency more closely with the popular will while preserving state influence: implement a phased interstate popular-vote compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform federal standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so outcomes are trusted and transparent. Complementing this with ranked-choice ballots or a congressional-district element can encourage broader campaigning and protect smaller communities from being ignored.",
    "Preserve the federal character of presidential elections but reduce winner-take-all distortions by requiring states to allocate electors proportionally or by district, banning faithless electors, and enforcing nationwide minimum standards for secure, auditable ballots. Phased reforms and bipartisan oversight will help build public confidence and give all regions reason to see their votes as meaningful.",
    "Move toward a national popular outcome while safeguarding trust: adopt an interstate compact or constitutional route to recognize the national vote, but only after establishing uniform rules for registration, voting methods, audits, and dispute resolution and investing in outreach so rural and smaller states remain heard. Paired with ranked-choice voting, this would reward broad support rather than narrow geographic advantages.",
    "A balanced reform path blends state-level administration with national fairness by keeping state-run elections but mandating proportional elector allocation, clear anti-gerrymandering protections, and consistent national audit and recount standards so results are both representative and defensible. Implementing changes gradually through bipartisan legislation or an interstate compact will reduce disruption and help build cross-aisle acceptance.",
    "Start from the shared goal of trusted, equal-weight ballots: adopt uniform federal safeguards (secure paper ballots, audits, and recount triggers) and reform allocation (proportional splits, district methods, or a compacted national popular tally) with a transition plan that protects smaller-state voice and incentivizes candidates to compete broadly. Clear, simple rules and phased implementation can bridge competing concerns and restore confidence in presidential outcomes.",
    "A practical, bipartisan approach would modernize the Electoral College while protecting the voice of smaller states: phase in proportional or district-based elector allocation, strengthen rules that require electors to follow certified results, and encourage an interstate compact or amendment to reflect the national popular will once broad safeguards are in place. Pairing that with nationwide standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and optional ranked-choice voting would reduce winner-take-all distortions and encourage candidates to seek broader support across regions. This phased plan prioritizes stability, transparency, and equal weight for voters without discarding federalism overnight.",
    "Reform should aim for both legitimacy and balance by shifting incentives away from a handful of swing counties: require clearer, uniform election standards and audits, adopt proportional allocation or a district-plus-at-large hybrid for electors, and move toward a national popular-vote solution only after strong safeguards are adopted. Adding ranked-choice voting or a runoff requirement can ensure majority support while protecting smaller and rural communities through fair districting and minimum geographic representation rules. Those changes can make every vote feel meaningful while preserving predictable, secure outcomes.",
    "A constructive compromise is to preserve the states\u2019 role but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation and supporting an interstate compact that triggers only when sufficient states agree to common security, recount, and audit standards. Complementing that with a ban on faithless electors, stronger federal baseline rules for ballot access, and optional ranked-choice voting would improve trust and ensure winners command broad support. This balanced, incremental approach seeks legitimacy, transparency, and protection for smaller-state interests simultaneously.",
    "To bridge competing concerns, implement a phased reform package: establish uniform federal standards for access, counting, and auditing, move states toward proportional or district-based allocation of electors with a statewide bonus to preserve cohesion, and allow a National Popular Vote compact or amendment to take effect only after robust safeguards exist. Encourage adoption of ranked-choice voting to reduce spoilers and require electors to follow certified results so outcomes are credible and defensible. This approach protects regional voices while making the presidency more reflective of the overall popular will.",
    "Meaningful reform should blend respect for federalism with a stronger tie to the popular vote: adopt proportional or congressional-district allocation statewide, tighten rules against faithless electors, and pursue a national popular-vote mechanism contingent on common standards for security, audits, and ballot access. Pair these changes with optional ranked-choice ballots and clear recount triggers so winners demonstrate broad support and close contests are resolved transparently. The result would be a durable, more trusted system that makes every ballot matter while safeguarding smaller communities.",
    "The system should preserve meaningful state involvement while making every vote feel equally consequential: that means pursuing reforms such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors, or an interstate compact to reflect the national popular vote, coupled with ranked\u2011choice ballots to ensure majority support. Any change must be phased in with uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, clear recount rules, and limits on faithless electors so outcomes are transparent and widely trusted.",
    "A durable compromise would keep federalism\u2019s role in presidential elections but reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions by moving toward proportional allocation or congressional\u2011district methods and by requiring electors to follow certified results. Paired with nationwide baseline rules for secure ballots, independent redistricting, automatic audits, and public civic education, these steps can rebalance incentives so candidates compete broadly and voters in every community feel heard.",
    "To bridge concerns about both legitimacy and local voice, adopt a national popular\u2011vote mechanism\u2014via an interstate compact or amendment\u2014while embedding protections for smaller states such as a modest geographic distribution requirement or a minimum electoral floor. Complement that with ranked\u2011choice voting, uniform election standards, enforceable audits, and phased implementation overseen by bipartisan panels to build confidence across regions.",
    "Modernize rather than discard the Electoral College by requiring states to allocate electors more proportionally, eliminating faithless elector loopholes, and strengthening uniform standards for voter access, counting, and recounts. Coupling these operational reforms with options like ranked\u2011choice voting and an interstate compact creates a pragmatic path that honors state roles while better aligning outcomes with the popular will.",
    "Focus reform on trust and fairness: ensure every ballot is secure and auditable, set clear national baselines for access and recounts, and then choose between a calibrated national popular vote or proportional state allocations\u2014implemented gradually and transparently. This paired approach protects smaller communities, reduces the power of a few swing areas, and makes presidential races reward broad, cross\u2011regional coalitions.",
    "A durable compromise preserves the role of states while making outcomes reflect the popular will: adopt reforms like proportional or district-based elector allocation and require electors to follow certified state results, paired with national minimum standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. Pairing those changes with ranked-choice voting or an interstate compact phased in once safeguards are in place would encourage broader campaigning and reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions without a sudden constitutional upheaval.",
    "Balance federalism and fairness by moving toward a national popular outcome implemented carefully\u2014through an interstate compact or constitutional amendment\u2014while protecting smaller and rural communities with geographic thresholds, stronger local election funding, and anti\u2011gerrymandering rules. Uniform auditing, clear recount rules, and binding electors will build trust so reforms are seen as legitimate across regions and parties.",
    "Practical reform should reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all incentives and make every vote feel meaningful by requiring proportional allocation of electors or a hybrid district-plus\u2011at\u2011large system, backed by consistent national standards for voting access, secure paper ballots, and routine audits. Adding ranked\u2011choice voting for national contests can ensure winners have broad support while preserving the states\u2019 role in administering elections.",
    "A phased approach earns broad support: start with uniform federal baselines for ballot access, audits, and recount procedures and encourage states to adopt proportional elector allocation or join a national\u2011vote compact once those safeguards exist. This combination protects smaller states\u2019 voices, reduces the sway of a few swing areas, and improves transparency so outcomes are trusted across the country.",
    "Seek common ground by keeping a state\u2011based framework but eliminating extreme distortions\u2014require electors to follow certified results, move away from winner\u2011take\u2011all toward proportional or district methods, and adopt nationwide standards for election integrity and voter access. These steps can preserve federal balance while making presidential elections more representative, contestable, and trusted by voters everywhere.",
    "A durable reform should make every ballot feel equally meaningful while preserving states\u2019 role in our federal system, for example by moving away from pure winner-take-all toward proportional or district-based allocation of electors paired with a pathway to a national popular-vote compact.  Any change must be phased, include uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts, and adopt measures like ranked-choice voting to encourage broader, majority-building campaigns.  Framing reforms around transparency, reliable administration, and bipartisan safeguards can protect smaller communities while restoring public confidence that the winner truly earned a national mandate.",
    "Bridge-building reforms should aim to reflect the national popular will without discarding the federal balance, for instance by encouraging states to allocate electors proportionally or by district while states pursue a coordinated compact toward a national tally.  Alongside any allocation changes, clear national baselines for voting access, paper audits, and automatic recount triggers will make outcomes harder to dispute and easier for all regions to accept.",
    "A sensible middle path keeps state-based administration but reduces the distortions of winner-take-all by adopting proportional allocation or congressional-district methods and by promoting a National Popular Vote compact as participation grows.  Complementing that shift with ranked-choice voting, independent redistricting, and robust, uniform security and audit standards will encourage candidates to earn broad support across urban and rural communities and increase public trust in close elections.",
    "Reforms should protect smaller states\u2019 voice while making every vote count more equally by combining a state-respecting allocation of electors (proportional or district-based) with national minimum standards for ballot access, transparent audits, and rules preventing faithless electors.  A phased, bipartisan implementation that emphasizes clarity and reliability can lower partisan tension and ensure outcomes feel legitimate to voters everywhere.",
    "To reconcile concerns about fairness and federal balance, adopt a phased package that replaces winner-take-all with proportional or district allocations, creates interoperable interstate compacts toward a national popular tally, and requires uniform safeguards\u2014paper ballots, routine audits, automatic recounts, and ranked-choice voting where feasible.  This approach preserves states\u2019 roles, reduces the power of a few battlegrounds, and prioritizes transparent, verifiable processes so elections are both representative and broadly accepted.",
    "Reform should preserve the role of states while making each vote carry more equal weight: move away from winner-take-all in favor of proportional or district-based elector allocation and pursue an interstate popular-vote compact as a gradual option. Pair those changes with nationwide minimum standards for ballot access, secure paper ballots, transparent audits, and clear recount rules so outcomes are trusted and smaller communities remain heard.",
    "A practical path blends a national popular-will principle with protections for regional voices: implement a popular-vote mechanism through an interstate compact or amendment while requiring uniform election administration, robust audits, and safeguards for rural and small-state representation. Complementary measures like ranked-choice voting and anti-gerrymandering rules can reduce winner-take-all distortions and encourage candidates to build broad coalitions.",
    "Keep state-based administration but raise the fairness floor by mandating consistent standards for access, counting, and certification, prohibiting faithless electors, and shifting most states toward proportional or district-based elector allocation. Coupling those reforms with investments in local election infrastructure and automatic recount thresholds preserves federalism while strengthening legitimacy and reducing the power of a few swing areas.",
    "Prioritize legitimacy and stability: require that presidential outcomes more closely reflect the popular will by encouraging proportional allocation or a compacted national tally, and simultaneously enforce uniform rules for voter registration, secure ballots, and post-election audits. Adding ranked-choice voting and clear, timely recount procedures will make results more representative, reduce polarizing winner-take-all incentives, and help citizens accept close outcomes.",
    "Modernize the Electoral College as a compromise: retain a meaningful role for states but eliminate extreme winner-take-all effects through proportional or district methods, and mandate nationwide baseline standards for security, transparency, and ballot audits. Back this with public education and bipartisan oversight so every ballot feels meaningful, smaller communities keep a voice, and election results are broadly trusted.",
    "A balanced reform would preserve states\u2019 role while ensuring the presidency reflects the popular will by moving toward proportional allocation of electors or an interstate popular-vote compact with clear safeguards.

    "To build consensus, retain federalism but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors and exploring an interstate compact that respects geographic diversity. Implement nationwide minimum standards for ballot access, auditing, and recount procedures to make outcomes transparent and secure. Complement these structural changes with ranked-choice voting to reward broader coalitions and reduce polarization.",
    "Reform should aim for a system where every lawful vote carries comparable weight while preserving meaningful state voices\u2014through a phased approach that combines proportional electoral allocation and adoption of a national popular-vote compact once safeguards are in place. Mandatory uniform rules for election administration, audits, and prohibitions on faithless electors will help make any transition stable and widely accepted.",
    "A pragmatic bridge is to modernize the Electoral College rather than abolish it: require states to allocate electors more proportionally or by district, and create an interstate mechanism to reflect the national popular will without erasing local representation. Alongside this, establish national baseline standards for voter access, paper audits, and recounts so results are trusted across regions. These paired reforms can reduce swing-state dominance, protect smaller communities, and make winners feel legitimately elected.",
    "Finding common ground means keeping the federal character of presidential elections while aligning outcomes more closely with voters\u2019 preferences by moving to proportional electors or a vetted national popular-vote solution. Strong, uniform safeguards\u2014secure paper ballots, transparent audits, clear recount rules, and limits on faithless electors\u2014should accompany any change to preserve stability and confidence.",
    "A practical reform should balance state interests with equal representation by phasing in a national popular-vote compact or requiring proportional allocation of electors, while also adopting uniform standards for ballot access, secure paper audits, and clear recount rules. Paired with measures like independent redistricting and safeguards for smaller states, this approach preserves federalism, raises confidence in outcomes, and incentives candidates to seek broad support.",
    "Preserve the role of states in administering elections but reduce winner-take-all distortions through proportional or district-based elector allocation and broader use of ranked-choice voting, alongside national minimums for election security and transparent audits. That combination helps more voters feel their ballot matters, lowers the swing-state focus, and protects stability during the transition.",
    "Modernize the system by moving toward a national popular vote via an interstate compact or adopting proportional allocation, while establishing uniform, legally binding standards for voting access, counting, and auditing to ensure trust and legitimacy. Built-in protections for smaller and rural communities and anti-gerrymandering rules can preserve regional voice while aligning outcomes more closely with the popular will.",

    "Reform should combine legitimacy with stability by adopting proportional or district allocations of electoral votes and moving toward a national popular standard through a phased interstate compact, all under enforceable, nationwide rules for ballot access, counting, and auditing. Paired measures\u2014ranked-choice voting, independent redistricting, and protections against faithless electors\u2014will push candidates to earn wider support and protect rural and small-state voices. A careful, transparent rollout with bipartisan safeguards will make change durable and broadly acceptable.",
    "A practical compromise keeps a federal structure but reduces perverse incentives: require states to award electors proportionally or by congressional district, adopt national minimums for election administration and paper audits, and impose clear recount and certification rules, while allowing an interstate compact to implement a popular vote when safeguards are met. Adding ranked-choice ballots and stronger anti-gerrymandering measures helps ensure majority support and fair competition across regions. These steps aim to make every ballot count without sacrificing local representation or stability.",
    "Practical reform should balance one-person-one-vote with regional voice by moving away from strict winner-take-all toward proportional or mixed allocation of electors, enforcing uniform standards for secure ballots and transparent audits, and establishing automatic recount triggers in close races. Complementary changes\u2014ranked-choice voting, binding electors, and measures to reduce gerrymandering\u2014encourage broader campaigning and reduce swing-state dominance. Phased implementation and bipartisan oversight will build public confidence and protect smaller communities.",
    "The best path is a balanced, phased approach: shift toward proportional or district-based elector allocation or an interstate popular-vote compact once consistent nationwide safeguards (secure paper records, audits, recount rules) are in place, and pair that with ranked-choice voting and anti-gerrymandering safeguards to reward coalition-building. Binding electors and transparent, enforceable standards will make outcomes easier to accept while preserving meaningful local influence. Gradual, bipartisan reform focused on trust and clarity can bridge competing concerns about fairness and federalism.",
    "A practical path forward balances state-based federalism with equal-weight voting by pairing national baseline standards for ballot access, secure paper ballots, routine audits, and clear recount rules with reforms that reduce winner-take-all distortions\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors or district-based awards. Phased adoption via interstate compacts, pilot programs, and protections against faithless electors can preserve smaller states\u2019 voice while making outcomes easier to trust.",
    "Preserve the role of states in administering elections while ensuring the popular will is reflected more closely by adopting uniform election standards and considering proportional or district-level allocation of electors; alternatively, allow a National Popular Vote compact to take effect once it secures broad, bipartisan safeguards. Complementary reforms like ranked-choice voting and stronger audit and recount rules would encourage broader campaigning and reduce incentives to focus only on a few swing areas.",
    "Reforms should prioritize legitimacy and stability by combining national safeguards\u2014uniform voter access, secure paper trails, routine audits, and automatic recount triggers\u2014with electoral adjustments that soften winner-take-all effects, such as proportional assignment of electors or a ranked-choice national tally. A deliberate, transparent transition that respects smaller states\u2019 concerns and includes bipartisan buy-in will help the public accept results and encourage candidates to compete nationwide.",
    "A middle-ground solution strengthens trust without discarding federalism: require consistent national standards for voting administration and audits while moving electoral allocation toward proportional or district-based methods or enabling a carefully designed interstate popular-vote compact. Built-in protections\u2014anti-gerrymandering rules, limits on faithless electors, and phased implementation\u2014can protect local voices and make every ballot feel more meaningful.",
    "The most constructive reform pairs national baseline rules for ballot access, counting, and audits with changes that reduce winner-take-all distortions\u2014whether through proportional electors, district methods, or a popular-vote compact enacted with strong safeguards. Prioritizing transparency, bipartisan oversight, and phased implementation will preserve stability while making outcomes reflect broader national support and encouraging candidates to earn votes across the country.",
    "A balanced reform would keep the states central to administering elections while making each ballot count more equally nationwide, for example by moving toward a national popular-vote compact or by requiring proportional or district-based allocation of electors. Pairing that with uniform standards for access, secure paper ballots and routine audits, clear recount rules, and limits on faithless electors can preserve stability and build trust across regions.",
    "We should aim for gradual, bipartisan changes that reduce winner-take-all distortion\u2014such as proportional allocation or congressional-district methods\u2014while exploring a national popular-vote solution once robust, uniform safeguards for voting access, audits, and recounts are in place. Complementary reforms like ranked-choice voting and independent redistricting can encourage broader campaigns and protect smaller-state voices.",
    "A practical middle path preserves federal balance but aligns outcomes more closely with the popular will by adopting proportional electors or an interstate compact to reflect national votes, implemented with clear, nationwide minimum standards for ballot security, timely counting, and recount triggers. This phased approach protects rural and smaller-state influence while reducing incentives for polarized, swing-state-only campaigning.",
    "Reform should focus less on overturning structures and more on fixing incentives: eliminate winner-take-all distortions through proportional allocation or district-based rules, require electors to follow certified results, and set uniform rules for elections and audits to ensure legitimacy. By combining these changes with options like ranked-choice voting and a cautious interstate compact, the system can reward broad-based support without erasing states\u2019 roles.",
    "To build widespread confidence, adapt the Electoral College to make every vote matter more\u2014through proportional or district allocations or a national popular-vote compact\u2014while simultaneously establishing uniform, enforceable standards for voter access, secure ballots, audits, and recounts. A phased, transparent implementation that guards smaller-state representation and curbs faithless electors can bridge partisan divides and sustain stability."
