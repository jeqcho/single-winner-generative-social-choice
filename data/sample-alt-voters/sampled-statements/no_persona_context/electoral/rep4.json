    "Preserve the constitutional role of states while making every ballot feel comparably consequential: pursue reforms that move outcomes closer to the national popular will\u2014such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors or an interstate popular-vote compact\u2014paired with ranked-choice options where practical. Back these changes with uniform standards for voting access, transparent counting, routine audits, and clear rules for electors so trust, stability, and representation across urban and rural communities are all strengthened.",
    "Balance state voice and democratic legitimacy by keeping a federal structure but reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions through proportional allocation or a well\u2011designed interstate compact that triggers only with broad bipartisan safeguards. Alongside this, standardize ballot access, recount procedures, and anti\u2011faithless\u2011elector rules so outcomes are easier to defend and candidates must compete for votes across the whole country.",
    "Modernize the selection of the president by aligning incentives toward broad, cross\u2011regional support: adopt measures like proportional or district allocation of electors, consider ranked\u2011choice voting to ensure majority support, and support a national popular\u2011vote pathway implemented gradually. Pair structural change with clear national baseline standards for counting, audits, and access so smaller states retain voice while every voter\u2019s ballot carries meaningful weight.",
    "Create a pragmatic compromise that honors federalism and majority rule by encouraging states to move away from winner\u2011take\u2011all toward proportional or district splits, or by joining an interstate popular\u2011vote compact with strict transparency conditions. Reinforce this shift with uniform election administration, automatic audits, and firm penalties for faithless electors to rebuild confidence that outcomes are fair, predictable, and inclusive of both urban and rural communities.",
    "Seek reforms that make presidential elections more representative without erasing smaller\u2011state protections: favor proportional or district\u2011based elector allocation or a carefully staged national popular\u2011vote agreement, and adopt ranked\u2011choice voting where it reduces spoilers. Combine any structural change with nationwide standards for access, counting, and recounts so trust in the result grows and campaigns must engage voters across all regions.",
    "Preserve the role of states in presidential elections while making every lawful vote feel equally meaningful by moving toward either a national popular outcome or more proportional state allocations; practical steps include encouraging an interstate compact for the popular vote, allowing proportional or district-based elector assignment, and adopting ranked-choice ballots to ensure broad support. Pairing these changes with uniform standards for ballot access, transparent counting and audits, and clear rules for faithless electors will protect smaller-state voices while rebuilding confidence across the country.",
    "A sensible compromise keeps federalism\u2019s safeguard for smaller states but reduces winner-take-all distortions by promoting proportional allocation or district-based electors and by supporting an eventual national popular standard through an interstate compact or amendment. Strong, nationwide guardrails\u2014consistent access rules, timely audits, and limits on faithless electors\u2014should accompany any change so results are transparent, trustworthy, and encourage candidates to campaign broadly.",
    "Balance fairness and stability by ensuring the presidency more closely reflects the popular will while preserving meaningful state representation: adopt proportional or district-based elector allocation, consider the National Popular Vote compact as a phased approach, and add ranked-choice voting where feasible to reward broad coalitions. Complementary reforms\u2014uniform recount and audit standards, anti\u2011gerrymandering safeguards, and clear elector commitments\u2014will help build bipartisan trust and keep rural and small-state voices heard.",
    "Modernize the system so voters everywhere feel their ballots matter without abandoning the federal structure: move away from pure winner-take-all toward proportional splits or district methods, pursue an interstate agreement for a national popular outcome when broadly supported, and introduce ranked-choice voting to prevent spoiler effects. Ensure these reforms are paired with clear, consistent rules for access, counting, and certification to strengthen legitimacy and protect smaller communities from being ignored.",
    "Find common ground by keeping state-based participation but making outcomes more representative and less dependent on a few swing jurisdictions\u2014this can be achieved through proportional elector allocation, a phased national popular vote compact, or adopting ranked-choice voting. Back those changes with uniform standards for ballot security, audits, and elector fidelity so the system rewards broad support, preserves regional voices, and restores public confidence in tight contests.",
    "A practical path forward honors both the role of states and the democratic principle that every ballot should carry comparable weight: adopt reforms that move outcomes closer to the national popular will\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors or an interstate compact for the popular vote\u2014while pairing any change with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, and audits. By phasing reforms and preserving safeguards for smaller states, the system can become more transparent and trustworthy without abrupt disruption, encouraging broader campaigning and greater public confidence.",
    "Reform should aim for a balanced system that makes every vote feel meaningful while protecting regional voices: shift away from winner-take-all distortions through proportional or district-based elector allocation or a national popular-vote mechanism, and require consistent, transparent rules for certification, recounts, and elector fidelity. A phased, bipartisan approach that includes measures like ranked-choice voting and stronger auditing can reduce incentives for litigation and help people accept close results.",
    "A workable compromise preserves federalist protections for smaller states while ensuring the presidency reflects broad public support by adopting proportional allocation or an interstate compact that honors the national popular vote, together with uniform standards for voting access, secure counting, and automatic audits. Combining gradual implementation with incentives for candidates to campaign widely and safeguards like ranked-choice voting can strengthen legitimacy and reduce the sense that a few battlegrounds decide everything.",
    "Change should prioritize legitimacy and stability: reform the Electoral College to reduce winner-take-all distortions\u2014through proportional splits, district methods, or a National Popular Vote compact\u2014while mandating clear, nationwide minimum standards for ballot access, counting, and certification so outcomes are transparent and trusted. A careful, stepwise transition that preserves meaningful state input and adds protections against faithless electors can bridge concerns about both majority rule and smaller-state influence.",
    "An effective reform strategy balances equal representation and federalism by moving toward outcomes that reflect the popular will\u2014via proportional elector allocation, a popular-vote compact, or ranked-choice runoff\u2014paired with consistent national rules for election administration, audits, and elector compliance. Phased implementation and bipartisan safeguards will help ensure the system remains predictable, encourages broad campaigning, and rebuilds public trust across urban and rural communities.",
    "Reform should balance respect for states with equal-weighted voting by phasing in measures like proportional or district-based allocation of electors, while establishing uniform standards for ballot access, counting, and post-election audits to rebuild trust. A national popular vote compact or ranked-choice runoff can be pursued as a deliberate, bipartisan transition that preserves regional voice while making the presidency reflect broader voter support.",
    "A practical path forward is to keep the federal structure but reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions through proportional allocation or congressional\u2011district methods, paired with clear nationwide rules for recounts, faithless electors, and election security. Complementing these changes with incentives for candidates to campaign broadly\u2014such as a phased interstate popular\u2011vote agreement or ranked\u2011choice runoffs\u2014helps ensure both small states and individual voters feel heard.",
    "Changes should aim for equal legitimacy and stability by combining measures that make every ballot matter\u2014proportional electors, expanded House representation, or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact\u2014with strong, uniform standards for access, auditing, and certification. That blended approach protects smaller states\u2019 voices while reducing the chance that a handful of battlegrounds decide outcomes.",
    "A sensible compromise preserves state involvement but makes the presidency reflect the national will: adopt proportional or district allocations and pursue a carefully staged national popular\u2011vote compact alongside ranked\u2011choice voting, nonpartisan redistricting, and mandatory audits. These reforms emphasize transparency and inclusion so voters everywhere can trust and participate in the result.",
    "Reform should focus on fairness and trust by ending rigid winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014through proportional splits or district methods\u2014and by implementing uniform rules for ballot access, recounts, and elector obligations; a phased national popular\u2011vote mechanism with ranked\u2011choice safeguards can bridge federalist concerns and majority rule. This balanced plan encourages broader campaigning, protects smaller states\u2019 influence, and makes each vote feel consequential.",
    "Preserve the federal role in choosing presidents while making each ballot feel comparably meaningful: adopt reforms that move outcomes closer to the national popular will\u2014such as proportional or district-based allocation or an interstate compact for the popular vote\u2014paired with ranked\u2011choice runoffs where useful and clear bans on faithless electors. Coupling any change with uniform standards for ballot access, secure counting, and routine audits will protect smaller states\u2019 voice while rebuilding trust through transparency and predictable rules.",
    "Modernize the Electoral College by reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and strengthening consistent administration: require electors to reflect voters\u2019 choices, encourage proportional splits or a congressional\u2011district method with a statewide bonus, and expand uniform recount and audit standards. These steps preserve state involvement, incentivize broader campaigning, and make outcomes easier to defend without an abrupt constitutional overhaul.",
    "Move toward a system that honors both national legitimacy and regional fairness by phasing in a popular\u2011vote outcome through an interstate compact or similar mechanism, with safeguards like ranked\u2011choice voting, nonpartisan districting, and robust, standardized election procedures. A deliberate, transparent transition that protects smaller states\u2019 interests and tightens audit, certification, and anti\u2011fraud measures can build bipartisan confidence and reduce the outsized influence of a few swing jurisdictions.",
    "Balance equal representation and federalism by binding electors to clear vote outcomes, reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all effects through proportional allocation, and imposing national minimums for ballot access, secure counting, and post\u2011election audits. These pragmatic reforms preserve state roles while ensuring results better reflect the electorate and are widely trusted.",
    "Seek common ground through modest, practical reforms that make every vote count while keeping states central: adopt proportional or district allocations, require transparent statewide procedures and rapid audits, and consider ranked\u2011choice or runoff mechanisms to produce majority winners. By pairing procedural safeguards with measures that encourage candidates to compete broadly, the system can honor local voices and national legitimacy at the same time.",
    "Preserve the federal role of states while making every ballot feel meaningfully counted by moving away from winner-take-all distortions and adopting measures like proportional allocation, the National Popular Vote compact, or ranked-choice voting paired with clear safeguards.

This hybrid approach preserves smaller states\u2019 voice, reduces winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, and makes outcomes harder to contest, restoring confidence across diverse communities. The emphasis should be on trust-building, simplicity, and wide bipartisan adoption rather than abrupt upheaval.",
    "Modernize the system to make every lawful vote count similarly without erasing state influence by encouraging proportional or district-based electoral allocation, pursuing a carefully phased National Popular Vote compact, or using ranked-choice ballots to ensure majority support. At the same time, mandate uniform minimum standards for voting access, certification, and audits and strengthen rules against faithless electors to protect legitimacy.

Simultaneously enforce consistent, transparent standards for voting access, certification, and audits and eliminate ambiguity around faithless electors to guard legitimacy. A measured, well\u2011publicized transition with bipartisan buy\u2011in will reduce polarization and make every voter feel heard.",
    "Preserve the federal role of states while making every lawful vote feel equally consequential by moving toward allocation methods that reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014such as proportional or district-based electors or an interstate compact that honors the national popular vote\u2014paired with ranked\u2011choice runoffs where needed. Accompany any change with uniform standards for ballot access, secure counting, and transparent audits so smaller states retain a meaningful voice and the outcome is broadly trusted.",
    "Reform should aim for a pragmatic middle path: keep state involvement in selecting electors but shift incentives so candidates must court broader support\u2014through proportional allocation, congressional\u2011district splits with a statewide bonus, or a phased national popular\u2011vote compact\u2014while embedding ranked\u2011choice voting and clear recount rules.

Pair these reforms with clear national minimums for ballot access, security, and post\u2011election audits so both rural communities and populous states can accept and trust presidential outcomes.",
    "Pursue a conservative, trust\u2011building overhaul that preserves state roles while making every ballot count: transition to proportional or district allocations or a carefully phased national popular\u2011vote agreement, institute ranked\u2011choice runoffs to avoid spoilers, and codify protections against faithless electors. Back the change with uniform standards for voter access, transparent counting, and routine audits so reform enhances legitimacy without sidelining less populous states.",
    "Preserve the federal role of states while making each ballot feel equally meaningful by phasing in reforms that move outcomes closer to the national popular will\u2014such as an interstate compact committing states to the popular vote or proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and clear rules to bar faithless electors. These measures should be phased and bipartisan so smaller states retain a meaningful voice while voters nationwide see their votes translate more directly into presidential outcomes.",

A gradual, transparent rollout with bipartisan safeguards will preserve federalism while rebuilding public trust that every vote matters.",
    "Seek a practical compromise that keeps the Electoral College\u2019s federal foundation but corrects its biggest fairness problems by requiring electors to reflect the popular vote in their jurisdictions, expanding proportional allocation by district or statewide shares, and mandating national minimum standards for access, verification, and recount procedures. Doing this in stages with cross\u2011party agreement reduces sudden shocks, protects rural and small\u2011state influence, and makes outcomes easier for citizens to accept as legitimate.",
    "Combine respect for state roles with a commitment to one\u2011person\u2011one\u2011vote: adopt reforms like proportional or district splits of electors or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact alongside uniform election rules, robust audits, and penalties for faithless electors, and use ranked\u2011choice voting where practical to prevent spoilers and ensure broad mandates.

    "A workable compromise keeps the state-based structure but reduces the sense of wasted votes by requiring states to move away from winner\u2011take\u2011all allocation toward proportional or district splits and by exploring an interstate mechanism to reflect the national popular vote when a large coalition of states agrees. Any change should be accompanied by clear national minimums for ballot access, secure tabulation, transparent audits, and fair districting to guard legitimacy and reduce litigation. Phased implementation and bipartisan buy\u2011in can lower partisan fear and strengthen public confidence across urban and rural communities alike.",
    "Modernize the system through modest, practical reforms that make each ballot feel meaningful while respecting smaller states: adopt proportional or congressional\u2011district allocations, consider ranked\u2011choice voting to ensure broader mandates, and implement an interstate compact approach to a national popular outcome only after agreed safeguards are established. Reinforce these allocation changes with uniform rules for access, counting, audits, and anti\u2011gerrymandering measures so the process is transparent and trusted. Such a cautious, consensus-driven path preserves stability, reduces polarization, and helps citizens accept close results as legitimate.",
    "A balanced reform would preserve the constitutional role of states while making every ballot carry more equal weight\u2014for example by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors, instituting ranked-choice voting, or implementing a national popular vote compact with clear safeguards. Uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and penalties for faithless electors would build trust and reduce litigation. Together these changes can incentivize candidates to campaign broadly and make outcomes feel legitimate to both urban and rural communities.",
    "Modernizing the presidential selection process should aim to reconcile equal representation with federalism by phasing in reforms that reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014such as proportional allocation, expanded House seats, or an interstate compact to respect the national popular vote\u2014while protecting smaller states\u2019 influence. Any shift should be paired with national standards for security, recounts, and transparent audits so the public can trust results.",
    "Common-sense reform keeps states central to administration while ensuring the presidency reflects broader voter preferences: require electors to follow voters, adopt proportional or district-based allocations, and consider ranked\u2011choice or a national popular vote implemented gradually. Coupling these changes with clear uniform rules for ballot access, recounts, and hard protections against partisan interference will strengthen legitimacy across regions.",
    "A pragmatic compromise recognizes the value of federalism and the need for one\u2011person, one\u2011vote legitimacy. Practical steps include ending winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions through proportional or district allocation, adopting ranked\u2011choice voting to ensure broad support, or using an interstate compact to align outcomes with the national popular vote once safeguards are in place. Strong national baselines for access, auditing, and timely certification, plus penalties for faithless electors, are essential to build confidence. Together these reforms can encourage broader campaigning, reduce polarization, and preserve smaller states\u2019 meaningful voice.",
    "Reform should bridge fears of big\u2011city dominance and concerns about unequal ballots by making every vote more consequential while maintaining state roles: pilot proportional allocation, strengthen rules binding electors, or pursue a phased national popular\u2011vote approach with ranked\u2011choice safeguards. Uniform, transparent standards for voting, counting, and audits will ease partisan tensions. The aim is a stable, trusted system that rewards broad coalition\u2011building and makes outcomes widely accepted.",
    "A fair path forward keeps states central while making votes count more equally: adopt proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with an interstate compact or a clear path to a national popular outcome, and strengthen uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and bans on faithless electors. These measures preserve federalism, encourage candidates to campaign broadly, and rebuild public trust by making outcomes harder to contest.",
    "Reforms should aim to preserve the voice of smaller states while reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014options include proportional electors, congressional\u2011district allocation with a statewide bonus, or a phased National Popular Vote compact combined with ranked\u2011choice voting. Uniform, transparent rules for counting, recounts, audits, and access will be essential to secure buy\u2011in across regions.",
    "Bridge proposals should combine respect for state roles with a commitment to one\u2011person\u2011one\u2011vote: expand or reform the House to reduce malapportionment, move toward proportional or district\u2011based elector allocation, or pursue an interstate popular\u2011vote compact implemented only with broad bipartisan safeguards. Paired national standards for election security, transparent audits, and limits on faithless electors would make any transition orderly and widely acceptable.",
    "A consensus approach balances federal representation and democratic equality by encouraging states to adopt proportional allocation or district splits while creating incentives\u2014through an interstate compact or staged reforms\u2014for a national popular\u2011vote outcome once safeguards like ranked\u2011choice voting and consistent recount standards are in place. Prioritizing clear rules, secure ballots, and broad civic outreach will help ensure smaller communities remain heard while every ballot matters.",
    "Practical reform combines modest changes and shared protections: end blanket winner\u2011take\u2011all allocations in favor of proportional or district methods, enact uniform standards for ballot access, counting, and audits, and consider a carefully timed National Popular Vote compact or constitutional fix with ranked\u2011choice safeguards. This mix honors the federal system, encourages cross\u2011country campaigning, and raises confidence that the presidency reflects both regional interests and the national will.",
    "A balanced reform should preserve the federal role of states while making each lawful vote carry more equal weight; practical options include shifting away from winner-take-all toward proportional or district-based allocation of electors and pursuing an interstate compact to reflect the national popular vote when strong, bipartisan safeguards exist. Pairing allocation changes with uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and binding rules for electors can reduce swing-state distortions and increase public trust. The overall aim is a stable, transparent system that rewards broad, cross\u2011regional support without erasing local voices.",
    "Reforms can bridge federalist concerns and democratic equality by keeping state-run elections while making outcomes track the popular will more closely\u2014options include proportional allocation, congressional\u2011district methods with a statewide bonus, or a carefully phased interstate compact. Uniform rules for access, clear recount procedures, and tools like ranked\u2011choice voting to ensure majority support will make elections fairer and more widely accepted.",
    "Meaningful change begins with shared goals of legitimacy, equal representation, and protection for smaller communities, so practical reform should combine measures that increase the weight of individual votes\u2014such as proportional allocations, ranked\u2011choice ballots, or a national popular vote compact\u2014with strict safeguards that preserve interstate balance. National minimums for ballot access, transparent counting, automatic audits, and binding elector rules reduce uncertainty and litigation. Phased implementation and bipartisan thresholds can build confidence, incentivize nationwide outreach, and lower incentives for zero\u2011sum campaigning.",
    "A middle\u2011ground approach respects the federal character of presidential elections while addressing winner\u2011take\u2011all unfairness by encouraging proportional or district\u2011based elector allocation and supporting an interstate agreement to honor the national popular vote only after robust safeguards are in place. Coupling allocation reform with uniform election\u2011administration standards, transparent audits, and penalties for faithless electors will make results more legitimate and campaigning more inclusive.",
    "To reconcile competing priorities, reform should prioritize both equal voter weight and meaningful local voice by adopting proportional or district methods, exploring ranked\u2011choice voting, and pursuing an interstate compact toward a national popular vote only with clear, bipartisan protections. Strong national standards for ballot access, counting, recounts, and elector commitment are essential to preserve trust. Together these steps would reduce swing\u2011state fixation and help more communities feel represented.",
    "Reform should preserve the federal balance that protects smaller states while making every vote feel equally meaningful, for example by moving away from winner\u2011take\u2011all allocations toward proportional or district\u2011based electors or by committing states to a national popular vote compact with clear safeguards. Any change must be paired with uniform standards for ballot access, transparent counting and audits, and bans or clarity on faithless electors so outcomes are trusted and campaigns reach the whole country.",
    "A practical bridge is a phased, bipartisan approach that improves parity without erasing state voices: encourage proportional allocation or the district method, pilot ranked\u2011choice voting, and only trigger a national popular\u2011vote compact after broad, cross\u2011party buy\u2011in. Coupling these moves with national minimum standards for recounts, voter access, and election security can reduce swing\u2011state dominance and rebuild public confidence.",
    "To unite competing concerns, reforms should focus on legitimacy and predictability\u2014ensuring electors reflect voters, reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, and adopting uniform certification rules\u2014while protecting meaningful state representation. Practical options include proportional electors, an interstate popular\u2011vote compact with thresholds, or ranked\u2011choice runoffs, all backed by transparent audits and clear timelines so close results don\u2019t become chaos.",
    "A fair middle path preserves state influence but makes presidential outcomes track the national will more closely: require electors to follow the popular vote, move toward proportional distributions or district formulas, and explore ranked\u2011choice voting to reward broad coalitions. Strong, consistent rules for ballot access, security, and timely recounts should accompany any change so communities across urban and rural areas feel heard and trust the process.",
    "Meaningful reform balances equal representation with federalist safeguards by phasing in changes that are simple, auditable, and bipartisan\u2014such as ending winner\u2011take\u2011all, expanding proportional allocation, or adopting a carefully designed national popular\u2011vote compact with a clear activation threshold. Paired with uniform election standards, anti\u2011gerrymandering measures, and limits on faithless electors, this approach can broaden competition, reduce incentives for polarization, and restore trust in presidential elections.",
    "A pragmatic reform would preserve states\u2019 role in presidential elections while making each ballot count more equally by moving away from strict winner\u2011take\u2011all rules toward proportional or district-based allocations and supporting interstate cooperation to honor the national popular will. Coupling this with uniform standards for access, secure counting, impartial audits, and protections against faithless electors can sustain small-state influence while restoring confidence that outcomes reflect broad, nationwide support.",
    "To bridge concerns about both majority rule and regional voice, adopt a phased approach that pairs a national popular-vote goal\u2014via an interstate compact or constitutional amendment\u2014with safeguards like ranked\u2011choice voting, proportional elector allocation, and a small statewide bonus where appropriate. Strengthening consistent ballot-access rules, transparent recount procedures, and independent audits will ensure reforms increase legitimacy without sidelining rural and less-populated communities.",
    "Reform should aim for a system that rewards broad, cross-regional coalitions while ensuring one person, one vote is respected: end winner\u2011take\u2011all extremes by moving to proportional or district-based elector allocation and consider a national popular\u2011vote mechanism once bipartisan trust and uniform standards are in place. Implement ranked\u2011choice voting to reduce spoiler dynamics and require electors to follow legal outcomes to prevent faithless swings. Robust, nationwide minimums for ballot access, counting, and audits will protect small\u2011state influence and make results easier for all to accept.",
    "A balanced path keeps the federal character of presidential elections but reduces the outsized influence of a few battlegrounds by reforming how electors are awarded\u2014through proportional allocation, district methods, or a carefully constructed national popular-vote compact. Paired with clear, uniform rules for voting access, certification, and recounts, these changes can make every ballot feel meaningful while protecting smaller and rural communities from being ignored.",
    "Practical reform should preserve states\u2019 voices while aligning outcomes more closely with the popular will by combining proportional or district-based electoral allocation with options for interstate compacts or ranked\u2011choice national voting. Ensuring consistent, transparent election administration\u2014audits, recount standards, and protections against partisan manipulation\u2014will build the bipartisan confidence necessary for any lasting change."
