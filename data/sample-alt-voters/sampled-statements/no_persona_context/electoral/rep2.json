    "A practical reform should preserve the constitutional role of states while making every vote carry more comparable weight: pursue phased changes such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors, the National Popular Vote compact, or ranked-choice voting together with stronger, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, and audits. By coupling modern voting methods with clear, transparent safeguards and a gradual implementation plan, the system can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, encourage candidates to campaign broadly, and rebuild public trust without discarding federalism overnight.",
    "Reform should aim for a balanced approach that retains state influence while aligning outcomes more closely with the popular will: adopt proportional or district allocations and support interstate compacts or ranked\u2011choice mechanisms as options, paired with nationwide baseline rules for voter access, recounts, and post\u2011election audits. This combination reduces the power of a few swing states, protects smaller communities, and makes elections easier to understand and accept through predictable, transparent procedures.",
    "A sensible path forward is incremental and pragmatic: keep the state\u2011based framework but replace winner\u2011take\u2011all with proportional or district allocations or join a national popular\u2011vote compact, while instituting uniform standards for registration, ballot security, and audits. These paired reforms would make each ballot more consequential, incentivize broader campaigning, and strengthen confidence that outcomes reflect the will of the electorate without abruptly scrapping federalist protections.",
    "Bridge the divide by modernizing rather than abolishing the Electoral College\u2014encourage states to move to proportional or district\u2011based elector allocation or support an interstate popular\u2011vote compact, and require clear national minima for election administration, recounts, and audits. A phased, transparent reform package like this reduces wasted votes and swing\u2011state fixation while safeguarding the voice of smaller and rural communities and reinforcing trust in results.",
    "Work toward a system that honors both \u201cone person, one vote\u201d and the federal role of states by adopting reforms such as proportional or district allocations, ranked\u2011choice voting, or an interstate popular\u2011vote agreement, all implemented alongside uniform, enforceable standards for access, counting, and auditing. Combining method changes with stronger transparency and a gradual rollout can minimize disruption, reward coalition\u2011building across regions, and restore confidence that elections reflect the public will.",
    "Preserve the federal balance while making every vote feel meaningful by moving toward clearer, more proportional methods of awarding electors\u2014such as statewide proportional allocation or district-level awards\u2014paired with strong national standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts. Implement changes gradually with safeguards like anti-gerrymandering rules and protections for smaller states so reforms increase trust without sudden disruption.",
    "Blend respect for states with the principle of one person, one vote by adopting interstate agreements or phased reforms that ensure the popular will matters alongside regional representation, for example through a National Popular Vote compact or proportional elector distribution. Require uniform election administration, paper backups, and independent audits so outcomes are transparent, secure, and widely accepted.",
    "Modernize presidential selection to reward broad, cross-regional coalitions rather than narrow swing-state tactics by pairing proportional or district-based elector allocation with ranked-choice voting and national minimum standards for voting access and recounts. Phase in reforms and guard against partisan manipulation so both urban and rural communities keep a meaningful voice while the overall result better reflects the popular will.",
    "Strike a practical compromise that reduces \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions while honoring federalism: require clearer, uniform rules for elections and move toward proportional elector awards or an interstate popular-vote solution implemented with safeguards for small states. Prioritize transparency, auditability, and civic education so reforms strengthen legitimacy and encourage candidates to compete across the whole country.",
    "Seek incremental reforms that make outcomes more reflective of the national vote\u2014such as eliminating winner-take-all allocations in favor of proportional or district-based methods or adopting a compact that ensures the popular vote decides the presidency\u2014while enforcing consistent national standards for security, access, and recount procedures. Design transitions with bipartisan oversight and protections for smaller states to build trust and preserve stability.",
    "A durable reform should balance the principle that every vote carries comparable weight with the value of state-based representation by moving toward measures\u2014such as an interstate popular\u2011vote compact or proportional/district allocation of electors\u2014that better align outcomes with the national will. Any change should be phased in alongside uniform standards for ballot access, secure paper\u2011backups and audits, and tools like ranked\u2011choice voting to preserve broad coalition\u2011building and public trust.",
    "A practical path forward is to reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions while preserving the federal character of elections by encouraging proportional or district allocation of electors and advancing a national popular\u2011vote mechanism as states agree. Paired with clear, nationwide standards for registration, counting, recounts, and post\u2011election audits, these reforms can make outcomes more representative without sudden upheaval and help rebuild confidence across regions.",
    "Reform should aim for both equal voter weight and meaningful state voice: pursue an incremental mix of approaches\u2014proportional allocation or district methods, an interstate popular\u2011vote compact, and adoption of ranked\u2011choice voting\u2014so winners reflect broad support. Coupling these changes with uniform election administration, secure paper records, and transparent audits will make results easier to accept and preserve incentives for candidates to campaign nationwide.",
    "Finding common ground means modernizing the system so the national popular will matters more while protecting smaller states\u2019 role, for example by phasing in a compact or shifting to proportional/district electors backed by safeguards like nonpartisan redistricting and strong auditing. Clear, uniform rules for access and counting and tools such as ranked\u2011choice voting can reduce polarization, limit strategic gaming, and strengthen public confidence in presidential outcomes.",
    "A shared approach prioritizes making every vote feel consequential while keeping the federal balance: support practical reforms\u2014proportional or district allocation of electors, a state\u2011driven popular\u2011vote compact, and optional ranked\u2011choice ballots\u2014implemented gradually. Reinforcing those changes with nationwide standards for security, transparency, and post\u2011election audits will protect legitimacy and encourage candidates to seek support across diverse communities.",
    "A fair path forward balances the goal of reflecting the national popular will with preserving a meaningful role for states by adopting practical reforms\u2014such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors and stronger interstate standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. Phased changes like interstate compacts or pilot programs for ranked-choice voting can ease transition while reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and incentivizing candidates to compete broadly. Clear, uniform safeguards against faithless electors and partisan gerrymandering will help build cross\u2011partisan trust in the outcome.",
    "Reform should aim for equal weight for individual votes while protecting geographic diversity: pursue measures like a national popular\u2011vote compact or proportional electoral allocation paired with uniform national standards for voter registration, security, and transparent audits. Gradual implementation and bipartisan oversight can preserve stability and reassure smaller states their concerns are respected. The focus should be on rules that encourage coalition\u2011building and reduce incentives to litigate close contests.",
    "Practical modernization can reconcile competing priorities by keeping the state\u2011based framework but eliminating winner\u2011take\u2011all extremes\u2014through proportional or district allocations, anti\u2011gerrymander protections, and optional ranked\u2011choice voting\u2014while establishing national baselines for access, counting, and post\u2011election audits. A phased, transparent approach reduces disruption and builds confidence across regions and parties. The shared aim is a system that makes every vote matter and winners broadly legitimate.",
    "To bridge divergent views, combine respect for federalism with clearer democratic equality: adopt proportional electors or a national popular vote compact implemented alongside uniform election standards, automatic registration, and robust auditing. Incremental reforms and pilot programs can test ranked\u2011choice methods and district allocations without a sudden constitutional overhaul. This approach keeps smaller states heard while aligning outcomes more closely with the will of voters and reducing swing\u2011state fixation.",
    "A sensible compromise prioritizes legitimacy and stability by aligning incentives for broad campaigning with protections for local representation\u2014update the system through proportional or congressional\u2011district allocations, interstate agreements toward a popular\u2011vote outcome, and consistent rules for ballot access, recounts, and elector fidelity. Phased adoption with bipartisan safeguards and transparent audits will ease concerns and strengthen trust. The goal is a simple, fair process that encourages nationwide coalition\u2011building and minimizes winner\u2011take\u2011all grievances.",
    "The presidential system should balance one-person\u2011one\u2011vote fairness with the federal role of states by phasing in practical reforms: adopt proportional or district-based allocation of electors while pursuing an interstate popular\u2011vote compact as more states reach agreement, all paired with uniform standards for ballot access, recounts, and audits. These changes preserve meaningful state influence, reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, and make every vote feel consequential while strengthening public confidence through transparency and clear safeguards.",
    "A shared approach would protect smaller states\u2019 voice while aligning outcomes more closely with voters\u2019 preferences by encouraging states to move away from winner\u2011take\u2011all\u2014using proportional allocation, a congressional\u2011district model with anti\u2011gerrymandering rules, or an interstate compact that ensures the national popular winner prevails\u2014and by instituting consistent national standards for election security and recounts. Phased implementation and built\u2011in safeguards like ranked\u2011choice ballots and binding elector rules can ease the transition and reduce incentives for litigation or strategic rule\u2011shopping.",
    "Reform should be incremental and bipartisan: keep the state\u2011based framework but require clearer, uniform election procedures and require states to split electoral votes more proportionally or by district while exploring a national popular\u2011vote compact as consensus grows. Paired with strong audits, anti\u2011gerrymandering safeguards, and rules preventing faithless electors, this approach preserves federalism, widens competition beyond a handful of swing states, and makes outcomes more representative and trusted.",
    "A constructive path forward balances geographic representation with equal weight for voters by combining national minimum standards for voting access, security, and audits with reforms to reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all effects\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors, district\u2011level awards, or a carefully designed interstate popular\u2011vote agreement. Complementing procedural safeguards with ranked\u2011choice and public education will encourage broader coalitions, protect smaller states\u2019 interests, and build confidence that elections reflect the popular will.",
    "The most practical compromise preserves states\u2019 roles while ensuring legitimacy by moving toward either a national popular\u2011vote compact or standardized proportional allocation of electors, implemented gradually and paired with uniform rules for registration, counting, audits, and binding elector conduct. This balanced package reduces swing\u2011state dominance, rewards broad campaigning across regions, and strengthens trust through transparency and enforceable safeguards.",
    "A healthy path forward honors both the principle that every vote should carry similar weight and the value of preserving meaningful state influence, by pairing reforms that reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014such as proportional or district-based elector allocation or a carefully phased interstate popular\u2011vote compact\u2014with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts. Such a blend would encourage candidates to compete broadly, protect smaller and rural communities from being ignored, and rebuild public trust through transparency and predictable rules.",
    "Reform should balance majority legitimacy with federal stability by moving toward systems that better reflect the national popular will\u2014like proportional allocation, ranked\u2011choice voting, or an interstate popular\u2011vote agreement\u2014while simultaneously establishing national baselines for election security, automatic registration, and independent audits. This two\u2011track approach reduces the perverse incentives of a few battleground states, preserves meaningful local voices, and makes outcomes easier to accept across the political spectrum.",
    "A pragmatic compromise would preserve the state role in presidential selection while minimizing \u201cwasted\u201d votes: require states to end winner\u2011take\u2011all allocation in favor of proportional or district methods, paired with anti\u2011gerrymandering safeguards and consistent national rules for counting and certification. By combining modest structural changes with stronger, uniform election administration, the system could better align results with voter intent without discarding the federal character of the union.",
    "To bridge competing concerns, adopt reforms that increase voter equality and transparency\u2014such as a national popular\u2011vote compact or proportional electors\u2014while enshrining protections for smaller states through modest geographic thresholds or bonus electors and robust, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts. This balanced design encourages broad coalition\u2011building, reduces litigation risks, and helps citizens across regions accept outcomes as legitimate.",
    "An inclusive reform agenda pairs measures that make every ballot matter\u2014like proportional allocation, district apportionment with independent redistricting, or a staged national popular vote\u2014with nationwide guardrails for access, security, and transparent post\u2011election audits, so changes are trustworthy and gradual. That combination preserves federalism, expands voter influence beyond a handful of swing states, and rebuilds cross\u2011partisan confidence in presidential results.",
    "A durable compromise would preserve the federal role of states in presidential elections while making every ballot feel meaningful by moving away from winner\u2011take\u2011all allocations toward proportional or district\u2011based elector awards, or by adopting an interstate compact that honors the national popular vote. Any change should be phased in with uniform standards for voter access, recounts, audits, and protections against faithless electors so reforms strengthen legitimacy without sudden upheaval.",
    "Reform should aim to reduce \u201cswing\u2011state\u201d distortions and wasted votes by combining more proportional elector allocation with tools that encourage broad coalitions\u2014such as ranked\u2011choice voting or geographic distribution thresholds\u2014while keeping state administration of elections. Paired national standards for registration, paper ballots, and post\u2011election audits would build confidence across regions and parties.",
    "A balanced path is to keep the Electoral College\u2019s federal framework but require clearer, more equitable rules: award electors in ways that reflect vote share, ban faithless electors, and set nationwide baselines for ballot access and transparent counting. Incremental, bipartisan implementation through interstate agreements and strong auditing safeguards can bridge concerns about both small\u2011state voice and one\u2011person\u2011one\u2011vote fairness.",
    "Practical reform prioritizes legitimacy by aligning outcomes more closely with the popular will while protecting regional representation\u2014achieved by an interstate popular\u2011vote compact or proportional electoral allocation combined with ranked\u2011choice ballots in close races. Consistent national standards for security, recounts, and certification would ensure transitions strengthen trust rather than fuel dispute.",
    "Any durable solution should reconcile equality and federalism: ensure each vote carries comparable weight through proportional or popular\u2011vote mechanisms, but preserve incentives for candidates to campaign broadly by requiring geographic diversity or a small state bonus. Above all, reforms must be paired with clear, nonpartisan rules, accessible registration, and robust audits so winners and losers alike accept the result.",
    "A durable reform would preserve states\u2019 role while making every vote feel consequential: transition toward a system that honors majority will\u2014whether by a national popular-vote compact or by requiring proportional or district-based allocation of electors\u2014paired with ranked-choice options where useful. Coupling that change with uniform standards for access, secure paper records, and robust audits creates a phased, stable path that encourages candidates to campaign broadly and restores public trust. Clear, bipartisan guardrails and a gradual implementation timetable can bridge concerns about both regional voice and democratic equality.",
    "Change should aim for both fairness and stability by reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions while keeping federalism intact: require states to move toward proportional or district-based electoral allocations or join an interstate compact that reflects the national popular vote. Strengthening uniform voting standards, independent audits, and protections against faithless electors will make any new system more transparent and widely accepted. A phased approach with ranked\u2011choice options can encourage coalition building and ease the transition.",
    "Practical reform balances one person, one vote with meaningful state representation by combining a move toward a national popular tally (via interstate compact or amendment) or mandated proportional allocation of electors with clear national baseline rules for voting access, recounts, and audits. Including ranked\u2011choice voting and gradual implementation helps preserve stability and reduces incentives for narrow swing\u2011state campaigning. These paired reforms emphasize transparency and trust so the system reflects broad consensus rather than geography alone.",
    "A common\u2011sense bridge keeps states central but shrinks winner\u2011take\u2011all unfairness: adopt proportional or district-based elector allocation or an interstate popular\u2011vote agreement, while instituting uniform standards for ballot access, secure paper trails, and independent post\u2011election audits. Phasing in changes and offering ranked\u2011choice options can protect stability, encourage nationwide campaigning, and make outcomes easier to accept across regions. The focus should be on transparency, equal weight for votes, and safeguards that build cross\u2011partisan confidence.",
    "Reform should marry democratic equality with federal balance by moving away from winner\u2011take\u2011all toward proportional or district allocations or a national popular\u2011vote compact, accompanied by consistent election rules, mandatory audits, and protections against faithless electors. Phased implementation and optional ranked\u2011choice voting can reduce polarization and ensure candidates must earn broad support across regions. These steps prioritize legitimacy, clarity, and trust so every voter feels their ballot matters.",
    "A workable reform should make every lawful vote carry similar weight while preserving the federal character that gives smaller states a meaningful voice; a practical path is to combine clearer, uniform standards for voting and audits with reforms such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors and a phased interstate compact toward a national popular tally. Paired safeguards\u2014like anti-gerrymandering rules, limits on faithless electors, and transparent recount procedures\u2014can protect stability and public trust. This balances equality of representation with geographic fairness so candidates face incentives to campaign broadly rather than only in a handful of battlegrounds.",
    "Reforming the presidential selection process should aim for outcomes that reflect the popular will without erasing state voices, by adopting measures like proportional distribution of electoral votes, ranked-choice voting, and an interstate compact that ultimately respects a national popular tally. Implementing uniform standards for ballot access, paper backups, and post-election audits will strengthen legitimacy and reduce incentives for legal challenges. Such a mixed, incremental approach honors federalism while making every ballot more meaningful.",
    "A balanced solution is to retain a role for states while reducing \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions through proportional or congressional-district allocations, complemented by national baseline rules for secure, transparent administration and anti-gerrymandering protections. Where feasible, an interstate agreement to recognize the national popular vote or the adoption of ranked-choice voting can be phased in with bipartisan oversight and clear recount standards. This combination promotes equal representation, geographic inclusion, and durable public confidence.",
    "Practical reform should bridge equality and federalism: require uniform election safeguards\u2014automatic registration, verifiable paper trails, and routine audits\u2014while moving toward proportional elector allocation or an interstate compact that aligns the Electoral College outcome with the national popular vote. Adding ranked-choice ballots and protections against faithless electors can reduce polarization and the undue influence of a few swing states. These steps can be implemented gradually to preserve stability and build bipartisan trust.",
    "To reconcile competing concerns, adopt a phased plan that increases vote equality and preserves regional voice: start with nationwide minimum standards for counting and auditing, require states to split or allocate electors proportionally, and advance an interstate compact or constitutional amendment for a national popular tally only after broad, bipartisan buy-in. Complementary reforms\u2014nonpartisan redistricting, limits on faithless electors, and ranked-choice options\u2014will encourage coalition-building and reduce the dominance of narrow battlegrounds. This pragmatic, incremental route protects legitimacy and responsiveness across communities.",
    "A practical reform balances the constitutional role of states with the democratic ideal that each vote should carry roughly equal weight: move gradually toward systems that reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortion\u2014such as proportional or district allocation of electors or an interstate national popular\u2011vote compact\u2014while pairing any change with uniform standards for ballot access, paper backups, and robust, nonpartisan audits. Phased implementation and clear safeguards can preserve smaller\u2011state voice, encourage candidates to campaign broadly, and rebuild trust in outcomes.",
    "Preserve federalism but modernize incentives by shifting toward outcomes that reflect the national will: adopt an interstate compact or proportional allocation method alongside ranked\u2011choice ballots to promote broader coalitions and reduce spoiler effects. Couple procedural change with national baselines for registration, counting, and post\u2011election audits so reforms strengthen legitimacy without sudden upheaval.",
    "Reform should keep states central to administration while ensuring fewer votes are \u201cwasted\u201d: require proportional or district\u2011based awarding of electors with independent redistricting and mandatory transparent recount and auditing standards. This approach tempers winner\u2011take\u2011all swings, protects smaller communities\u2019 voice, and incentivizes candidates to compete across regions rather than relying on a handful of battlegrounds.",
    "A commonsense bridge is to retain the Electoral College\u2019s structure but eliminate perverse incentives by mandating more representative allocation of electors and implementing nationwide minimum standards for election security, access, and certification. By phasing changes and committing to bipartisan oversight and clear rules, reforms can preserve regional representation while making presidential outcomes align more closely with the popular will.",
    "Focus reforms on legitimacy and fairness: reward broad, cross\u2011regional coalitions through either a national popular\u2011vote compact with ranked\u2011choice voting or proportional allocation of electoral votes, and back either path with uniform rules for registration, counting, and audits. That mix protects small\u2011state concerns, reduces swing\u2011state fixation, and makes it easier for all citizens to accept close results as legitimate.",

Pair any change with uniform standards for voter access, paper ballots, and robust post\u2011election audits so outcomes are transparent and trusted.",
    "Reform should balance federalism and popular equality by keeping states central to administration but ending winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions through proportional elector allocation or district\u2011based methods complemented by ranked\u2011choice voting at the national level. Strong, nonpartisan standards for registration, counting, and audits will ensure legitimacy and incentives for candidates to compete broadly, not just in a few swing states.",
    "A practical bridge is to modernize the Electoral College rather than discard it: require proportional distribution of electors or permit state participation in the National Popular Vote compact, coupled with protections against gerrymandering and faithless electors. Matched with consistent national rules on ballot security, automatic registration, and transparent recounts, this would make every vote more meaningful while preserving geographic balance.",
    "Change should be incremental and trust\u2011building\u2014encourage states to adopt proportional allocations or district reforms and support an interstate compact to honor the national popular will when a broad coalition of states joins. Enforceable, uniform election standards, paper trails, and routine audits will reduce litigation and help voters across urban and rural communities accept outcomes as fair.",
    "A sensible compromise pairs respect for states with equal\u2011weight voting: move away from winner\u2011take\u2011all by adopting proportional or district allotments, explore a National Popular Vote compact or modest constitutional fixes, and integrate ranked\u2011choice voting to reward broad coalitions. Back these changes with clear nationwide rules on access, recounts, and independent audits to protect small\u2011state voice while aligning results with the public will.",
    "A balanced reform would preserve states\u2019 role while ensuring one-person, one-vote fairness by moving toward either a national popular-vote mechanism or requiring proportional or district-based allocation of electors. Pairing any change with uniform standards for voter access, secure paper ballots, and transparent post-election audits will protect smaller-state interests and public trust. Phased, bipartisan implementation and clear recount rules can ease the transition and keep incentives to build broad, cross-regional coalitions.",
    "Fixes should reduce winner-take-all distortions and make every ballot meaningful without erasing the federal character of elections by adopting proportional allocation or an interstate popular-vote compact paired with ranked-choice ballots. Uniform election security, independent redistricting, and transparent audits will help build the broad trust necessary for any durable change.",
    "A practical middle path is to retain state-run elections while aligning outcomes more closely with the popular will through proportional or district-based electors or an interstate compact that assures the national popular winner. Strengthening national baselines for registration, ballot access, audits, and anti-gerrymandering safeguards will protect against manipulation and reassure skeptical communities. Careful, phased adoption with bipartisan oversight will preserve stability and encourage candidates to campaign broadly.",
    "Reforming the presidential selection process should marry equal-vote principles with geographic fairness by moving away from pure winner-take-all toward proportional allocation or a consensual national popular vote while keeping protections that ensure smaller and rural communities are heard. Complementary reforms\u2014ranked-choice voting, uniform certification standards, and guaranteed audits\u2014will strengthen legitimacy and reduce incentives for contentious, swing-state focused campaigns.",
    "The most durable approach balances one-person, one-vote legitimacy with the federal idea that states and diverse regions matter: either embrace an interstate popular-vote solution or require proportional/district allocations of electors. Any structural change must be accompanied by uniform rules for voter access, secure paper-based voting, nonpartisan redistricting, and transparent post-election audits. A phased, bipartisan path with clear legal safeguards will minimize disruption, preserve trust, and reward candidates who build broad, cross-regional coalitions.",
    "A durable reform should make every lawful vote matter while preserving the federal role of states; practical steps include moving toward a national popular\u2011vote outcome via interoperable interstate compacts or requiring proportional or district\u2011based allocation of electors, paired with uniform standards for ballot access, counting, and post\u2011election audits. Phased implementation and nonpartisan safeguards\u2014such as ranked\u2011choice voting, anti\u2011gerrymandering rules, and clear recount thresholds\u2014can build bipartisan trust and incentivize candidates to campaign broadly.",
    "Preserving state influence while ensuring electoral outcomes reflect the popular will calls for pragmatic, incremental changes: adopt proportional or district allocation of electors, encourage interstate compacts that honor the national popular vote, and standardize voter registration, ballot security, and recount procedures nationwide. These reforms should be transparent, phased in with bipartisan oversight, and designed to reduce \u201cwinner\u2011take\u2011all\u201d distortions so voters everywhere feel their ballots matter.",
    "A fair path forward balances one\u2011person\u2011one\u2011vote with regional representation by combining a commitment to nationwide standards for voting access and auditing with electoral mechanics that reduce wasted votes\u2014such as proportional allocation, district awards with anti\u2011gerrymandering safeguards, or a ranked\u2011choice national popular vote. By phasing reforms and embedding clear, nonpartisan safeguards, the system can encourage coalition\u2011building across states and restore confidence that results are both legitimate and inclusive.",
    "Reforms should prioritize legitimacy and stability by making the presidency track the popular will more closely while retaining incentives for cross\u2011regional campaigning; options include the National Popular Vote compact, proportional electoral allocation, or ranked\u2011choice voting within a phased, well\u2011audited framework. National baseline standards for registration, ballot access, recounts, and audits\u2014plus protections against faithless electors\u2014will help build public trust and reduce litigation after close elections.",
    "The best compromise is pragmatic: retain the state\u2011based administration of elections but eliminate winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions through proportional or district\u2011based elector allocation or by committing states to a popular\u2011vote compact, backed by uniform rules for access, security, and transparent audits. Such incremental, bipartisan reforms\u2014coupled with ranked\u2011choice ballots where feasible\u2014can protect smaller states\u2019 voices while ensuring that the presidency reflects broad popular support.",
    "A practical reform should balance one\u2011person\u2011one\u2011vote fairness with the federal role of states by moving away from winner\u2011take\u2011all allocation toward proportional or district\u2011based electors or by pursuing an interstate compact to honor the national popular vote, and by pairing any change with uniform standards for registration, secure paper ballots, audits, and transparent recounts to rebuild trust. Phased implementation and explicit safeguards for smaller states can reduce polarization and encourage candidates to campaign broadly rather than focus on a few swing jurisdictions.",
    "Preserve state involvement while making outcomes reflect the popular will by combining an interstate national\u2011popular\u2011vote solution or mandated proportional allocation of electors with reforms like ranked\u2011choice voting, independent redistricting, and mandatory post\u2011election audits. Clear, consistent rules and a gradual rollout will protect regional voices, limit legal disputes, and strengthen public confidence in close contests.",
    "Reform should seek common ground: end winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions through proportional or district allocation or achieve a national popular\u2011vote outcome via an interstate compact, and at the same time adopt uniform safeguards\u2014automatic registration, secure paper trails, anti\u2011gerrymandering measures, and transparent recount procedures. These paired steps respect federalism, make every ballot more meaningful, and reduce incentives for strategic neglect of whole regions.",
    "A bridging approach modernizes the Electoral College rather than upends it by combining practical electoral allocation changes (proportional or district methods, or a compact ensuring the popular\u2011vote winner) with nationwide standards for voting access, audits, and faithless\u2011elector protections. Phased, bipartisan implementation that preserves protections for smaller states will lower distrust and reward coalition\u2011building across diverse communities.",
    "Blend respect for federalism with equal representation by adopting proportional or district\u2011based elector rules or an interstate compact guaranteeing the popular\u2011vote winner, and pair those reforms with ranked\u2011choice voting, standardized election procedures, and rigorous audits to enhance legitimacy. Gradual adoption and explicit small\u2011state safeguards can build cross\u2011partisan trust and ensure campaigns engage voters nationwide.",
    "A balanced reform should preserve the federal role of states while making each vote more equal: adopt measures such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors, or an interstate compact to honor the national popular vote, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and anti-gerrymandering protections. This gradual, transparent approach would reduce winner-take-all distortions, discourage exclusive focus on swing states, and rebuild public trust without an abrupt constitutional overhaul.",
    "Modernizing presidential elections means keeping states central to administration while ensuring outcomes reflect the popular will: require states to adopt proportional or district allocation of electors and encourage ranked-choice voting, complemented by national baseline standards for voter registration, security, and recounts. Such incremental reforms can reward broader, coalition-building campaigns, protect smaller-state voice, and increase confidence in close results.",
    "A practical bridge is to guarantee that the candidate with broad national support wins while protecting smaller and rural communities by combining a national popular-vote mechanism (via an interstate compact or amendment) with safeguards like uniform voting standards, paper ballots, routine audits, and anti-gerrymandering rules. Phased, bipartisan implementation\u2014rather than sudden change\u2014will lower polarization and make every ballot feel meaningful.",
    "Reform should aim for one-person-one-vote fairness without erasing federalism: replace winner-take-all allocation with proportional or district-based methods, require electors to follow state results, and adopt national minimum standards for access, transparency, and audits; if consensus permits, an interstate compact or ranked-choice national popular vote can finish the work. These steps preserve state voice, reduce perverse incentives to focus on few battlegrounds, and strengthen the legitimacy of outcomes.",
    "The goal of reform should be simple: make elections clearer, fairer, and more trustworthy while keeping states a meaningful part of the process\u2014do this by adopting proportional allocations or an interstate national-popular-vote agreement, pairing those changes with ranked-choice voting where helpful and enforceable standards for counting, recounts, and audits. A cautious, transparent transition that addresses faithless electors and gerrymandering can unite diverse constituencies behind a system that counts every vote and encourages candidates to compete broadly."
