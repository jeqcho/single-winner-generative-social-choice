    "A workable reform preserves the states\u2019 role while making each ballot feel equally consequential: adopt a phased approach that moves away from winner\u2011take\u2011all allocation toward proportional or district\u2011based electors and incentivizes an interstate popular\u2011vote compact, paired with uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. Coupling these structural changes with ranked\u2011choice options and clear, bipartisan implementation timelines can protect smaller states\u2019 voice while restoring public trust in outcomes.",
    "Modernizing presidential elections should balance federalism with one\u2011person\u2011one\u2011vote by keeping state administration but ending winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014through proportional or congressional\u2011district allocation, support for a national popular\u2011vote compact, and optional ranked\u2011choice runoffs in close contests. Uniform security, transparency, and audit rules enacted alongside any change will build bipartisan confidence and encourage campaigns to earn support across more of the country.",
    "Reform that finds common ground would protect smaller states\u2019 influence while ensuring the presidency reflects broad voter support: require clearer, consistent election standards nationwide and transition to proportional electors or a state\u2011led popular\u2011vote compact, with ranked\u2011choice mechanics to avoid spoilers. A deliberate, legally durable rollout with robust audits and nonpartisan oversight can reduce swing\u2011state dominance and strengthen trust in results.",
    "An effective compromise preserves the electoral framework but prioritizes equal weight for votes by encouraging proportional allocation or an interstate popular\u2011vote agreement and by adopting ranked\u2011choice ballots for national clarity. Pairing these reforms with uniform rules on ballot access, recounts, and audits\u2014and a phased, bipartisan implementation\u2014will protect local voices while making outcomes more representative and less polarizing.",
    "Meaningful reform should marry the goal of one person, one vote with the need for geographic representation: retain state\u2011level administration but abandon winner\u2011take\u2011all in favor of proportional or district allocation, supporting an interstate popular\u2011vote compact and optional ranked\u2011choice runoff systems. Backstopping these changes with national minimum standards for security, transparent audits, and bipartisan oversight will help the public accept results and encourage candidates to campaign broadly.",
    "A modern, trustworthy presidential system can preserve the constitutional role of states while making each ballot matter: adopt reforms that shift away from winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014such as proportional or district allocation, interstate popular\u2011vote compacts, or ranked\u2011choice runoffs\u2014paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, and post\u2011election audits. Phased, bipartisan implementation and clear, transparent rules will protect smaller states\u2019 voices, reduce swing\u2011state fixation, and strengthen public confidence that outcomes reflect the will of the people.",
    "Balance and legitimacy should guide reform: keep state responsibility for administering elections but ensure the presidency more reliably reflects the popular will by ending extreme winner\u2011take\u2011all incentives\u2014through proportional allocations, a national popular\u2011vote compact, or ranked\u2011choice mechanisms\u2014and by requiring consistent standards for access, security, and audits across states. This combined approach respects federalism, encourages national campaigning, and builds cross\u2011partisan trust in results.",
    "Practical reform can bridge competing priorities by protecting small\u2011state representation while making votes more equal: require clearer, uniform election procedures and auditing, and move toward allocation methods that reduce all\u2011or\u2011nothing outcomes\u2014such as proportional or district\u2011based elector awards, interstate popular\u2011vote agreements, or ranked\u2011choice runoffs\u2014implemented gradually with bipartisan oversight. The goal is a transparent, stable system that rewards broad coalitions and makes every community feel heard.",
    "Reform should focus less on ideology and more on two objectives: fairness and trust\u2014achieved by keeping state administration but replacing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions with proportional or compacted popular\u2011vote approaches and by standardizing ballot access, recounts, and audit practices nationwide. A phased, consensus\u2011driven path preserves federal balance, reduces undue swing\u2011state influence, and makes it easier for voters across regions to accept close outcomes.",
    "A durable compromise would preserve the federal structure while aligning outcomes with the popular will: adopt allocation methods that make more ballots decisive (proportional, district, or interstate\u2011compact solutions), pair them with ranked\u2011choice tie\u2011breaking where helpful, and mandate uniform, transparent standards for election security and post\u2011election audits. Phased implementation and bipartisan safeguards can both protect smaller states\u2019 interests and restore widespread confidence that each vote counts.",
    "Maintain the federal role of states while making the presidency reflect the national will by phasing in reforms such as interstate agreements to honor the national popular vote or proportional allocation of electors, paired with nonpartisan, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts. These changes should be implemented transparently and incrementally to protect smaller-state interests, reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, and rebuild broad public trust in outcomes.",
    "Balance respect for state administration with equal\u2011weight voting by combining a move away from winner\u2011take\u2011all allocation\u2014through proportional or district-based electors\u2014with a national baseline of secure, auditable procedures and independent oversight. By sequencing reforms and keeping clear, uniform rules for access, counting, and post\u2011election audits, the system can preserve regional voices while ensuring the result is widely accepted as legitimate.",
    "Seek common ground by committing to reforms that make every ballot matter\u2014such as an interstate popular\u2011vote compact or proportional allocation of electors\u2014while simultaneously standardizing election security, recount thresholds, and transparent audits nationwide. This paired approach protects federalism and smaller communities\u2019 influence, reduces the swing\u2011state focus, and strengthens bipartisan confidence in presidential outcomes.",
    "Modernize the presidential selection process through modest, bipartisan steps: endized winner\u2011take\u2011all practices in favor of proportional or district allocations or an interstate popular\u2011vote pact, and require uniform, nonpartisan standards for ballot access, verification, and post\u2011election audits. Doing both will preserve state roles, reward broad coalition\u2011building, and make results easier for citizens of all regions to trust and accept.",
    "Build a bridge between tradition and fairness by keeping states central to administration while adopting measures that better align outcomes with the national vote\u2014whether via a compact, proportional electors, or ranked\u2011choice runoffs\u2014and by enforcing consistent, transparent rules for voting, counting, and auditing. Prioritizing phased implementation, clear communication, and independent oversight can protect smaller states\u2019 voices while restoring confidence that every lawful vote is counted equally.",
    "Preserve the constitutional role of states in administering elections while ensuring the presidency reflects the national will by moving toward either a national popular\u2011vote compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with ranked\u2011choice runoff options to avoid spoiler effects. Uniform standards for ballot access, paper ballots, audits, and transparent recount rules should accompany any change so outcomes are trusted and durable across jurisdictions.",
    "Update the system incrementally to reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions by encouraging proportional allocation of electors or a district method with a small statewide bonus, while strengthening nationwide rules for security, audits, and nonpartisan administration. Phased, bipartisan implementation and clear certification timelines will help preserve small\u2011state voices and public confidence as reforms take hold.",
    "Make every lawful vote feel meaningful by aligning the outcome more closely with the national popular will\u2014through an interstate popular\u2011vote compact or proportional state allocations\u2014while protecting geographic diversity with incentives for candidates to campaign broadly and safeguards for minority representation. Any system change should be paired with ranked\u2011choice mechanisms, uniform voting standards, and robust auditing so legitimacy and stability rise together.",
    "Balance federalism and equal representation by keeping states central to election administration but replacing winner\u2011take\u2011all rules with proportional or district\u2011based allocations and clearer, uniform standards for ballot access, recounts, and audits. A deliberate, transparent transition that expands oversight and civic education can reduce polarization and make outcomes widely accepted.",
    "Prioritize trust and clarity: adopt reforms that make the popular vote matter\u2014such as an interstate compact or proportional electors\u2014while mandating nationwide minimums for paper records, post\u2011election audits, and nonpartisan oversight to prevent disputes. Coupling modest structural change with stronger, uniform administration will protect small\u2011state interests and ensure results are fair, verifiable, and broadly legitimate.",
    "A sensible path balances respect for states with the principle that each vote should matter: preserve state administration while reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions through measures like proportional or district allocation of electors, interstate popular\u2011vote compacts, or ranked\u2011choice voting. Pairing any change with uniform standards for ballot access, secure audits, and clear recount rules, implemented gradually and bipartisanly, can protect smaller\u2011state voices while restoring public confidence that the presidency reflects broad, legitimate support.",
    "Reform should bridge federalism and equal representation by keeping states central to election administration but shifting incentives so campaigns must win broad, popular support\u2014options include proportional electors, a national\u2011vote compact, or ranked\u2011choice runoffs. Coupling these changes with nationwide standards for transparency, auditing, and recounts and a phased, nonpartisan timetable will reduce swing\u2011state dominance and build trust across regions.",
    "The goal is a presidential selection system that honors state roles while ensuring outcomes align more closely with the popular will: pursue modest structural changes such as proportional or district allocation of electors, interstate agreements for a national popular vote, or ranked\u2011choice mechanisms. Require concurrent national standards for ballot access, security, and post\u2011election audits, and phase reforms with bipartisan safeguards so smaller states are not erased and voters nationwide regain confidence.",
    "Find common ground by preserving the federal character of elections but making every ballot more consequential\u2014through proportional electors, district methods, or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact combined with ranked\u2011choice options to avoid spoilers. Back these reforms with uniform rules for voting access, secure auditing, and clear recount procedures, implemented gradually and with bipartisan oversight to protect stability and legitimacy.",
    "A practical compromise keeps states responsible for running elections while narrowing the gap between the Electoral College and the national popular will: adopt proportional allocations or a limited national\u2011vote compact, and consider ranked\u2011choice voting to foster broader coalitions. Ensure parallel reforms in election transparency, uniform standards, and robust audits so changes are durable, widely accepted, and protective of smaller\u2011state interests.",
    "A fair path forward would respect the constitutional role of states while ensuring the presidency reflects the broad will of the electorate: pursue measured reforms such as an interstate compact to honor the national popular vote, proportional or district-based allocation of electors, and adoption of ranked\u2011choice runoffs where appropriate. Pair any change with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, security, recounts, and transparent audits, and phase reforms through bipartisan, legally durable steps so voters nationwide can trust outcomes and candidates are incentivized to campaign beyond a handful of battlegrounds.",
    "Reform should bridge federalism and equal representation by keeping state administration but reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014through proportional or district allocations, an interstate popular\u2011vote compact, or ranked\u2011choice mechanisms\u2014to make more ballots matter. These changes must be coupled with nationwide standards for election integrity, clear recount rules, and an incremental, bipartisan rollout to maintain stability and public confidence.",
    "Balance and legitimacy can both be advanced by modernizing how electors are awarded\u2014moving toward proportional allocation or a compact that honors the national popular vote while preserving state roles\u2014and by introducing ranked\u2011choice options to reduce spoiler dynamics. Equally important are uniform rules for access, auditing, and certification and a phased, nonpartisan approach so the system is transparent, durable, and trusted across regions.",
    "A pragmatic reform agenda would preserve the federal character of presidential elections while ensuring every vote carries more equal weight: favor incremental changes like proportional or district-based elector awards, interstate cooperation on a national popular vote, and optional ranked\u2011choice runoff rules. Pairing these reforms with mandatory, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts\u2014and pursuing them through bipartisan processes\u2014will help build consensus and public trust.",
    "To unite competing concerns, aim for reforms that keep states central to administration but align outcomes more closely with the national popular will\u2014via proportional allocations, district methods, interstate compacts, or ranked\u2011choice runoffs\u2014while standardizing election security, ballot access, and audit procedures nationwide. Implement changes gradually and through bipartisan legal frameworks so the system strengthens participation, reduces swing\u2011state dominance, and earns broad legitimacy.",

By combining federalism with clear, enforceable safeguards, the system can encourage candidates to campaign broadly while making individual votes matter more equally.",
    "Modernize the Electoral College through a bipartisan, incremental approach: require electors to follow the statewide popular vote or adopt proportional allocation, ban faithless electors, and set national minimums for election security and post\u2011election audits. This preserves smaller states\u2019 voice and administrative stability while reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and rebuilding public confidence in outcomes.",
    "Move toward a national popular mandate without erasing state concerns by combining an interstate compact or national popular\u2011vote baseline with ranked\u2011choice voting and uniform, nonpartisan election administration, including clear recount triggers and routine audits. Phased, transparent implementation and protections for rural and minority communities can bridge fears about big\u2011city dominance while ensuring the winner reflects broad voter support.",
    "A practical compromise is to keep the federal structure but eliminate extreme distortions: award electors proportionally or by congressional district with a modest statewide bonus, strengthen uniform voting standards and chain\u2011of\u2011custody audits, and remove avenues for post\u2011certification gamesmanship. Those steps increase fairness and turnout across all regions while maintaining states\u2019 central role in administering elections.",
    "Reform should prioritize legitimacy and clarity by aligning outcomes more closely with the national popular vote\u2014through an interstate compact, proportional allocation, or modest House expansion\u2014while establishing consistent national rules for access, verification, and recounts. That blended path respects state traditions, reduces swing\u2011state myopia, and focuses on transparent, durable rules that voters of different views can accept.",

    "Modernize the system to balance one\u2011person\u2011one\u2011vote with regional representation: adopt proportional electors, a congressional\u2011district method, or a phased interstate compact, and consider ranked\u2011choice voting to reduce spoiler dynamics. Pair reforms with mandatory nationwide standards for election administration, audits, and certification so disputes are minimized and confidence grows across parties.",
    "Seek a middle path that preserves federalism but reduces \u201cswing\u2011state\u201d distortion by reallocating electors more proportionally or coordinating a national popular\u2011vote agreement while keeping states in charge of administration. Require clear, uniform rules on access, recounts, and transparent audits as preconditions so reforms strengthen legitimacy without creating new vulnerabilities.",
    "Reform should aim for legitimacy and stability: retain a state\u2011based framework but replace winner\u2011take\u2011all incentives with proportional or district allocations or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact, and add ranked\u2011choice options to encourage broader coalitions. Complement any structural change with strict, uniform standards for election security, timely counts, and public audits so results are defensible and widely accepted.",
    "Focus reforms on equalizing ballot weight while protecting smaller states\u2019 voice\u2014through proportional electors, district methods, or a national\u2011vote compact\u2014implemented gradually and transparently.

Ensure implementation is gradual, nonpartisan, and accompanied by measures\u2014like ranked\u2011choice voting\u2014that encourage broader coalition\u2011building and reduce swing\u2011state fixation.",
    "Focus on legitimacy over abolition: require uniform, transparent, and auditable election standards nationwide, end winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions through proportional or district methods, and consider a popular\u2011vote mechanism or ranked\u2011choice runoff to better reflect voter preferences. Preserve the practical role of states in running elections but implement reforms incrementally with bipartisan oversight to safeguard trust and stability.",
    "Keep the federal structure but make every vote matter by adopting proportional elector allocation or a National Popular Vote agreement combined with nationwide standards for security, audits, and accessible voting; add ranked\u2011choice voting to reduce spoiler dynamics. A transparent, phased approach with nonpartisan administration can reduce swing\u2011state dominance and restore cross\u2011partisan confidence in outcomes.",
    "A practical way forward is to preserve the states\u2019 role in choosing the president while making outcomes reflect the national will: phase in measures like proportional or district allocation of electors, consider an interstate compact that honors the national popular vote, and pair any change with uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That blend protects smaller states\u2019 voices, reduces winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, and builds the transparency needed for broad public confidence.",
    "Reform should balance federalism and equal representation by moving incrementally: require clear, consistent election rules and audits nationwide, adopt proportional or district methods in states that choose to, and use ranked\u2011choice or a compact approach to ensure the ultimate winner reflects broad voter support. Phased, bipartisan implementation and robust safeguards will keep smaller communities heard while making each ballot matter more equally.",
    "Seek common ground by keeping state administration of elections but ending rigid winner\u2011take\u2011all incentives\u2014through proportional allocations, congressional\u2011district methods, or a carefully designed interstate popular\u2011vote agreement\u2014while mandating uniform security, access, and transparent post\u2011election audits. This combination respects regional voices, reduces swing\u2011state dominance, and strengthens legitimacy so people across the country can accept results.",
    "Modernize the process without discarding federalism: require electors to follow clear popular\u2011vote outcomes at the state level, encourage proportional awarding or district splits to make more votes consequential, and adopt national minimum standards for ballot access, recounts, and audits. That approach preserves state influence, incentivizes national campaigning, and rebuilds trust through predictable, auditable rules.",
    "Find a bipartisan bridge by ensuring every lawful vote is treated consistently while retaining the structural role of states: pursue an interstate compact or proportional allocation to better align the presidency with the popular will, complementing those changes with ranked\u2011choice options, uniform election standards, and rigorous auditing to prevent disputes. Phased, transparent reforms that protect small\u2011state representation and strengthen oversight can help the country accept outcomes even in close races.",
    "The presidential selection process should preserve the federalist principle that states matter while making each citizen\u2019s ballot carry more comparable weight; practical reforms could include phased adoption of a national popular vote compact, proportional or district allocation of electors, and optional ranked\u2011choice runoffs to reduce spoiler effects. Any change must be paired with uniform standards for ballot access, secure paper ballots, and mandatory post\u2011election audits so results are transparent, auditable, and broadly accepted.",
    "Find a middle path that keeps states central to administration but reduces winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions: require electors to reflect the popular vote through proportional or district allocation, or bind states to an interstate compact that awards the presidency to the national popular\u2011vote winner. Strengthening nonpartisan election administration, uniform recount rules, and routine audits will help build confidence across regions and parties.",
    "Modernize the Electoral College incrementally by combining respect for state roles with mechanisms that better reflect the nationwide vote\u2014options include a national popular\u2011vote compact, proportional allocation, or ranked\u2011choice national tallies. Pair any structural change with clear, uniform standards for access, counting, and audits so outcomes are quick, transparent, and trusted.",
    "A balanced reform agenda would protect smaller states\u2019 voice while ensuring the presidency reflects broad public support: move away from strict winner\u2011take\u2011all toward proportional or district methods or adopt an interstate compact for the popular vote, and consider ranked\u2011choice safeguards in tight races. Complement these reforms with nationwide minimum standards for election security, accessible voting, and mandatory audits to strengthen legitimacy.",
    "Bridge federalism and equal\u2011vote goals by keeping states responsible for running elections but changing how electors are awarded\u2014through proportional allocation, district methods, or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact\u2014and by exploring ranked\u2011choice mechanisms to ensure majority support. Require uniform, transparent procedures, secure paper trails, and routine independent audits so reforms increase participation and trust without abrupt upheaval.",
    "A pragmatic path forward preserves states' role in running elections while making each ballot carry more equal weight: adopt phased reforms such as proportional or district-based electoral allocations and encourage an interstate popular-vote compact, paired with nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and secure counting. These changes should be incremental, transparent, and legally durable so small states retain a meaningful voice while public confidence in outcomes grows.",
    "Reform should aim to balance federalism and the principle of one person, one vote by replacing winner-take-all with proportional or ranked-choice mechanisms and by promoting a national popular-vote agreement, all backed by uniform rules for recounts, audits, and election security. By phasing in changes and protecting small-state representation, the system can reward broad coalition-building without sacrificing stability.",
    "The goal should be a trusted, clear system that respects state administration but more closely reflects the national popular will: encourage states to move toward proportional allocation or join a compact for the popular vote, and mandate common standards for ballot access, certification, and post-election audits. Incremental reforms that prioritize transparency, nonpartisan administration, and protections for smaller communities can build bipartisan legitimacy.",
    "Modernizing presidential elections means keeping states central to administration while reducing winner-take-all distortions\u2014through proportional or district allocations, ranked-choice options, or an interstate popular-vote compact\u2014paired with uniform security and audit standards. A phased, bipartisan approach that safeguards smaller states\u2019 voice and emphasizes transparency can make every vote feel meaningful and outcomes widely accepted.",
    "A sensible compromise combines respect for federalism with stronger popular legitimacy: phase in reforms like proportional electors or an interstate compact, adopt ranked-choice or runoff safeguards to ensure majority support, and require consistent national standards for election integrity and recounts. Doing so incrementally and transparently will protect small-state interests while making outcomes easier to understand and trust.",
    "A durable compromise would preserve states\u2019 central role in administering elections while making the presidency more reflective of the national will: end winner\u2011take\u2011all allocation in favor of proportional or district\u2011based electors or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact, paired with ranked\u2011choice ballots where useful. Any change should be phased in with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, security, and automatic audits so outcomes are transparent, auditable, and trusted by a broad cross\u2011section of voters.",
    "Reform should aim for two complementary goals\u2014every lawful vote should carry similar weight, and smaller states should still have reason to be heard\u2014by combining proportional allocation of electors or a National Popular Vote compact with stronger, nationwide rules for recounts, audits, and election integrity. A gradual, bipartisan implementation that builds consensus and protects local administration can reduce swing\u2011state distortions while maintaining federal stability.",
    "Seek a middle path that keeps federalism intact but reduces \u201cwinner\u2011take\u2011all\u201d distortions: move toward proportional or district\u2011based allocation of electoral votes, or adopt an interstate compact that honors the national popular vote, and couple that with ranked\u2011choice voting for clearer majorities. Pairing any structural change with uniform standards, nonpartisan administration, and routine post\u2011election audits will strengthen legitimacy and encourage candidates to campaign broadly rather than only in a few battlegrounds.",
    "A practical bridge is to retain state control over elections while making outcomes more representative\u2014require electors to reflect the popular vote through proportional allocation or a compact, expand transparent audit and recount rules, and consider modest House expansion to rebalance representation. Prioritizing clear, consistent rules and phased, bipartisan reform will reduce partisan mistrust and ensure the system rewards broad, cross\u2011regional coalitions.",
    "Balanced reform should honor the constitutional role of states while ensuring one person, one vote in practice: adopt proportional or district allocation of electors or join an interstate popular\u2011vote agreement, introduce ranked\u2011choice voting where appropriate, and mandate uniform election integrity and audit standards nationwide. Emphasizing transparency, legal durability, and gradual implementation can build cross\u2011party confidence and make every voter feel their ballot truly matters."
