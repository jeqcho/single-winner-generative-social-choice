    "A sensible path forward balances the federal role of states with the democratic ideal that every vote carry comparable weight: adopt reforms such as proportional or district-based elector allocation, paired with interstate agreements or a national popular-vote mechanism, and consider ranked-choice voting to encourage broader coalitions. At the same time, implement uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and clear recount rules so outcomes are transparent, secure, and widely accepted.",
    "Reform should preserve meaningful state influence while reducing winner-take-all distortions\u2014by moving toward proportional allocation, congressional-district methods with anti-gerrymandering safeguards, or a compact honoring the national popular vote combined with ranked-choice ballots. Complementing any structural change with nationwide standards for election administration and audits will help build bipartisan trust and encourage candidates to compete across more communities.",
    "A practical compromise keeps states central to running elections but aligns presidential outcomes more closely with voter intent: encourage an interstate national-popular-vote agreement or require proportional allocation of electors, and pair that with uniform voter access, secure paper-based systems, and clear recount thresholds. These steps can reduce swing-state dominance, reward coalition-building, and strengthen overall confidence in results.",
    "Change should aim for fairness, clarity, and stability by ensuring each ballot is meaningful while protecting smaller-state voices\u2014through reforms like proportional elector splits or a national popular-vote framework augmented by ranked-choice voting. Equally important are consistent rules for registration, ballot counting, and audits so the public can trust outcomes regardless of which system is chosen.",
    "Bridge-building reform combines a move away from winner-take-all incentives with stronger, uniform safeguards: adopt proportional or district-based elector allocation or an interstate popular-vote compact alongside ranked ballots, anti-gerrymandering measures, and transparent audit and recount standards. Together these changes can uphold federalism, make votes more equal, and restore confidence that elections reflect the will of the people.",
    "Preserve the role of states in running elections while making every vote feel equally consequential by phasing in reforms such as proportional allocation of electors, stronger national standards for ballot access and audits, and optional ranked-choice voting to promote majority support. Pairing incremental, bipartisan steps with clear public education and enforceable safeguards can reduce swing-state distortion, protect smaller communities, and rebuild broad confidence in outcomes.",
    "A practical path forward balances federalism and democratic equality by encouraging states to move away from winner-take-all rules\u2014through proportional or district-based elector allocation or joining a national popular vote compact\u2014while instituting uniform rules for recounts, voter access, and auditable paper trails. Gradual, transparent implementation and bipartisan oversight would help ensure legitimacy, preserve local voice, and reward candidates who build broad, cross-regional coalitions.",
    "Reform should aim for a system that rewards broad support and makes every ballot count: adopt proportional elector allocation or a national popular-vote mechanism, supplement it with ranked-choice voting to ensure majority winners, and standardize election administration, audits, and recount procedures nationwide. This incremental, consensus-driven approach protects small-state concerns while reducing the outsized power of a few swing areas and strengthening public trust.",
    "Blend respect for state roles with a stronger link between votes and outcomes by moving toward proportional electors or an interstate popular-vote compact, backed by uniform safeguards\u2014auditable paper trails, clear recount rules, and anti-gerrymandering measures\u2014to ensure fairness and transparency. Phased reforms and civic education can ease transition, preserve regional voice, and encourage leaders to campaign broadly rather than chasing narrow battlegrounds.",
    "Seek common ground through modest, verifiable changes: end winner-take-all distortions via proportional or district allocation, consider interstate coordination to honor the national popular will, and establish consistent national standards for access, security, and audits so outcomes are both representative and trusted. By prioritizing transparency, gradual implementation, and protections for smaller communities, the process can foster legitimacy and broaden civic engagement.",
    "A pragmatic path forward balances respect for states with the principle that every citizen\u2019s ballot should matter similarly: reforms can phase in proportional or district-based allocation of electors and explore an interstate popular-vote compact while strengthening uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. By pairing structural changes with clear, transparent safeguards and public education, the system can preserve local voices, reduce winner-take-all distortions, and rebuild broad trust in outcomes.",
    "Reform should aim to preserve federalism while making outcomes feel more directly tied to voters\u2019 preferences, for example by encouraging proportional electors or a compact that honors the national popular vote alongside ranked-choice options to ensure majority support. Coupling those reforms with consistent national safeguards\u2014auditable paper trails, uniform counting rules, and impartial recount thresholds\u2014offers a steady, bipartisan way to make every vote count and reduce the dominance of a few swing areas.",
    "A common-sense compromise keeps states central to administering elections but reduces winner-take-all distortions by moving toward proportional allocation, district methods with anti-gerrymander protections, or a phased interstate popular-vote agreement. Implementing these changes alongside clear, enforceable standards for access, security, and transparent audits can protect small-state interests while ensuring the presidency more closely reflects the will of the electorate.",
    "Meaningful reform should combine respect for state voices with stronger democratic equality: require elector allocations that better mirror voters (through proportional splits, district reforms, or a popular-vote compact) while instituting nationwide best practices\u2014uniform ballot rules, automatic registration options, and auditable counts\u2014to rebuild confidence and encourage candidates to campaign broadly. Gradual, clearly explained changes with bipartisan oversight can reduce polarization and make outcomes easier for most citizens to accept.",
    "The best bridge preserves the federal structure but prioritizes fairness and legitimacy by phasing in measures that make votes carry similar weight\u2014such as proportional electors or an interstate popular-vote mechanism\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting where useful and strict, transparent standards for counting and recounts. This twin approach protects smaller communities\u2019 influence, reduces the incentive to focus only on swing states, and strengthens public trust through clear, consistent rules.",
    "A fair path forward would preserve states\u2019 role in administering elections while ensuring each citizen\u2019s vote carries comparable weight, for example by encouraging proportional allocation of electors or pursuing an interstate compact to honor the national popular vote. Any change should be implemented gradually with uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, clear recount rules, and measures\u2014like ranked-choice voting or anti\u2011gerrymandering protections\u2014that promote broad, cross\u2011regional coalitions and strengthen public trust.",
    "Reforms should balance federalism with democratic equality by keeping state involvement but reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014through proportional or district-based elector allocation, a binding interstate popular\u2011vote compact, or ranked\u2011choice mechanisms that reward consensus. Paired with nationwide baseline standards for election security, timely audits, and clear recount procedures, such changes can boost legitimacy while protecting smaller and rural communities\u2019 voice.",
    "The best compromise is a stepwise modernization that preserves the constitutional role of states while making outcomes reflect the popular will more closely, such as adopting proportional electors or joining a national popular\u2011vote compact and piloting ranked\u2011choice ballots. Implementing these reforms with uniform rules for access, robust audits, and transparent recounts will reduce swing\u2011state incentives, reward coalition\u2011building, and rebuild confidence across diverse communities.",
    "Any durable reform must protect smaller states\u2019 influence and improve the equality and clarity of every ballot, for example by replacing winner\u2011take\u2011all with proportional or district allocation of electors, encouraging interstate agreement on the national popular vote, and promoting ranked\u2011choice voting. Coupling structural change with consistent national standards\u2014auditable paper trails, accessible registration, and clear recount rules\u2014can make results easier to accept and campaigns more nationwide in reach.",
    "A practical bridge is to retain state\u2011based administration while aligning outcomes with the principle of one person, one vote\u2014using proportional elector splits, an interstate popular\u2011vote compact, or ranked\u2011choice systems\u2014to reduce wasted votes and extreme swing\u2011state focus. Any shift should be phased in under transparent, bipartisan rules including uniform ballot procedures, strong auditing, and safeguards against gerrymandering so communities large and small feel heard and the process is trusted.",
    "We should preserve the federalist role of states while making each ballot carry more comparable weight by pursuing pragmatic, incremental reforms\u2014such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors, an interstate compact to honor the national popular vote once broadly adopted, and expanded use of ranked-choice voting to ensure majority support. Any change should be paired with uniform standards for access, auditable paper trails, and clear recount rules so outcomes are transparent, secure, and broadly accepted.",
    "A durable compromise balances state representation and equal voting power by keeping state-administered elections but replacing winner-take-all rules with proportional allocations or district-based awards, while encouraging a pathway to a national popular-vote outcome through an interstate compact and majority-assuring ranked-choice ballots. Strengthened, consistent safeguards\u2014uniform ballot standards, audits, and timely recount procedures\u2014will help build bipartisan trust during a phased transition.",
    "Reforms should aim to reduce \u201cswing state\u201d distortion without erasing smaller states\u2019 voice by shifting away from winner-take-all toward proportional electors or a compact that honors the national popular vote, combined with ranked-choice voting to promote broader coalitions. Coupling these structural changes with national baseline standards for access, security, and audits offers a stepwise, transparent path that voters across regions can accept.",
    "Seek common ground by modernizing the electoral system to reflect the popular will while protecting regional interests: adopt proportional or district-based elector allocation, support an interstate mechanism to reflect nationwide totals when widely joined, and use ranked-choice methods to ensure winners have broad support. Implementing clear, uniform rules for ballot access, verification, and recounts will make reforms credible and help restore public confidence.",
    "Strive for a pragmatic, bipartisan reform package that keeps states central to administering elections but ends winner-take-all distortions through proportional allocations or a qualified national popular-vote compact, and that introduces ranked-choice voting to secure majority mandates. Pairing institutional changes with consistent national safeguards\u2014audits, paper trails, and clear recount protocols\u2014will protect minority interests, encourage turnout, and produce outcomes the public can trust.",
    "A practical path forward balances the principle of one person, one vote with the value of state voices by phasing in reforms that make every ballot matter\u2014such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors and the option of an interstate popular-vote compact\u2014while strengthening uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. Implementing changes gradually, transparently, and with bipartisan oversight can reduce swing-state distortions, protect smaller communities, and restore broad public confidence in outcomes.",
    "Reform should seek common ground by preserving the federal structure that gives states a role in elections but ensuring outcomes better reflect voter intent through proportional electors, ranked-choice voting, or a national popular-vote mechanism implemented with clear safeguards. Coupling any allocation change with national minimum standards for security, transparent audits, and accessible voting will build trust and encourage candidates to compete across the whole country.",
    "To make presidential elections feel fairer to people everywhere, adopt pragmatic, incremental steps\u2014end winner-take-all allocations in favor of proportional or district methods, pilot ranked-choice ballots, and pursue an interstate compact if consensus emerges\u2014while mandating uniform rules for counting, audits, and voter access. This approach respects state roles, reduces wasted votes and litigation, and promotes broader turnout and legitimacy.",
    "A bridging reform honors both equal representation and federalism by ensuring every vote carries comparable weight through proportional allocation or a nation-wide popular tally, implemented only alongside clear, binding safeguards\u2014uniform ballot standards, auditable paper trails, and transparent recount procedures\u2014to protect smaller-state interests and public confidence. Phased, bipartisan implementation with public education will help the country accept outcomes as both fair and stable.",
    "Meaningful change should marry democratic equality with regional voice: require states to move away from winner-take-all, experiment with proportional or district-based elector splits and ranked-choice voting, and pursue an interstate popular-vote solution if it can be matched with strong, nationwide election standards. By pairing institutional reform with uniform security, access, and audit rules, the nation can reduce polarization, make campaigns more inclusive, and strengthen trust in presidential outcomes.",
    "A practical path forward preserves the states\u2019 role in administering elections while ensuring every vote carries comparable weight: adopt transparent, phased reforms such as proportional allocation of electors or an interstate compact that honors the national popular vote, paired with ranked-choice voting to reward broader coalitions. These changes should be implemented with uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and clear recount rules so outcomes are trusted across urban and rural communities.",
    "Balance can be found by keeping federalism intact but removing winner-take-all distortions\u2014require states to allocate electors proportionally or by district with anti-gerrymandering safeguards, and pair that with national minimum standards for security, audits, and timely counting. Phased, bipartisan implementation and public education will help rebuild confidence while encouraging candidates to compete broadly.",
    "A fair compromise is a hybrid approach that protects small-state influence while aligning outcomes more closely with the popular will: pursue an interstate national-popular-vote compact or proportional allocation in each state, combined with ranked-choice ballots to ensure majority support and reduce polarization. Complement these structural changes with uniform rules for registration, recounts, and verifiable audits so every voter trusts that their ballot matters.",
    "Reform should focus less on demolition and more on repair: keep state-by-state administration but eliminate winner-take-all practices by moving to proportional or district-based elector allocation, and adopt clear, nationwide standards for ballot integrity, recounts, and auditing. Such incremental, transparent steps protect local voice, reduce swing-state fixation, and increase participation while preserving constitutional federalism.",
    "To bridge competing concerns, pursue reforms that make every vote count without erasing regional representation\u2014implement proportional or district allocation of electoral votes, consider a national popular-vote compact as states coalesce, and use ranked-choice voting to encourage consensus winners. Pair structural change with strong, uniform protections for access, paper trails, and audits so outcomes are understandable and trusted across diverse communities.",
    "A workable reform should preserve the states\u2019 role in administering elections while making every ballot count more equally\u2014by phasing in measures such as proportional allocation of electors, interstate agreements that honor the national popular vote, or ranked-choice voting to encourage majority support. Any change ought to be paired with uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and clear recount procedures so outcomes are transparent and trusted across urban and rural communities.",
    "Common ground can be found in keeping federalism\u2019s protections for smaller states while reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions: require more proportional or district\u2011based elector allocations, promote an interstate popular\u2011vote compact as a phased option, and adopt ranked\u2011choice ballots to incentivize broader coalitions. These reforms should be accompanied by national baseline rules for security, audits, and voter access so the process is fair, simple to understand, and broadly accepted.",
    "Reforming the system should balance equal weighting of votes with the practical reality of state administration by moving incrementally\u2014encouraging states to abandon winner\u2011take\u2011all in favor of proportional splits or district methods, while exploring an interstate compact to reflect the national popular will. Crucially, this transition must include clear, uniform safeguards\u2014audits, accessible registration, and anti\u2011gerrymandering protections\u2014so every community trusts that its voice matters.",
    "A durable compromise is to keep state\u2011level election administration but align incentives toward national legitimacy: adopt proportional or district allocations of electors, consider a compact that honors the national popular vote, and add ranked\u2011choice voting to ensure broader mandates. Pairing these structural changes with consistent standards for recounts, voter access, and transparent audits will build confidence across regions and reduce the zero\u2011sum focus on a few swing states.",
    "Any meaningful update should aim for two outcomes\u2014making each vote matter equally and preserving regional voice\u2014by combining proportional elector allocation or a phased national popular\u2011vote agreement with ranked\u2011choice voting to encourage coalition building. Implementing uniform security, ballot\u2011access, and audit rules nationwide will ensure reforms enhance legitimacy, lower partisan tension, and keep campaigns engaged with communities of all sizes.",
    "A practical reform pathway would preserve states\u2019 role in running elections while making outcomes track the popular will more closely by encouraging proportional allocation, district-based awards, or an interstate popular-vote compact alongside ranked-choice options. Pairing any change with uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, clear recount rules, and anti\u2011gerrymandering safeguards\u2014implemented gradually and with bipartisan oversight\u2014can protect smaller communities, reduce swing\u2011state distortions, and rebuild public trust.",
    "Balance can be found by keeping the federal structure but reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014through proportional electors or a National Popular Vote agreement\u2014while adopting common national standards for voting access, audits, and recounts. Phased implementation and public education, together with measures like ranked\u2011choice voting, would encourage broader coalitions, protect minority voices, and make every ballot feel meaningful.",
    "Reforms should aim to make each vote matter equally without erasing state influence: require clearer, consistent rules for counting and security, give states tools to allocate electors more proportionally or by district, and support an interstate compact or constitutional route as consensus emerges. Doing this incrementally with bipartisan safeguards and transparent audits helps preserve rural and small\u2011state concerns while reducing the dominance of a few swing areas.",
    "The best bridge is a mixed approach that preserves state administration but aligns presidential outcomes with broad voter support\u2014combining proportional or district allocation and ranked\u2011choice reforms with national baselines for ballot access, auditing, and recounts. Anchoring change in clear, phased rules and bipartisan oversight will protect constitutional federalism, reduce polarization, and strengthen legitimacy so voters across regions feel represented.",

By combining federalist respect with practical safeguards, the system can reward broader coalitions and make outcomes feel legitimate to both urban and rural communities.",
    "Practical reform should bridge the desire for equal vote weight and the need to protect smaller states by pairing a move toward a national popular outcome\u2014or proportional electors\u2014with stronger, nationwide rules for election administration, audits, and recounts. Implementing ranked\u2011choice voting, anti\u2011gerrymandering safeguards, or proportional allocation can encourage broader support and reduce swing\u2011state fixation, while uniform technical standards preserve local control and trust. A transparent, incremental approach with bipartisan oversight can make the system simpler to explain and harder to dispute.",

Phased implementation with bipartisan oversight and public outreach can ensure changes strengthen trust, encourage turnout, and make presidential elections reflect both wide support and regional voices.",
    "Practical reform should aim for two goals at once: make every vote carry comparable weight and protect the meaningful role of states in organizing elections; this can be achieved through a mix of proportional elector allocation or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact combined with uniform auditing, ballot\u2011access rules, and safeguards against manipulation. Doing so gradually and transparently, with bipartisan buy\u2011in and clear thresholds for change, helps preserve stability while improving perceived fairness across communities.",
    "A durable path forward balances state responsibility with equal voter weight by moving away from winner-take-all distortions toward either proportional allocation or a national popular vote implemented incrementally and transparently.

The goal is pragmatic, incremental reform that encourages candidates to compete nationwide and restores public trust in outcomes.",
    "Practical reform starts with the shared goal that every vote should feel meaningful while preserving the federal fabric: adopt allocation methods that reduce wasted votes (proportional or district-based) or pursue a national popular outcome via an interstate compact, but only alongside uniform access rules, secure paper trails, and impartial audits.

    "The aim should be a simple, transparent system that aligns outcomes with the popular will without erasing state influence: move away from winner-take-all toward proportional allocation or an interstate compact, and consider ranked-choice voting to ensure majority support. Pairing reforms with nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and voter education will minimize partisan disputes and strengthen public confidence in peaceful transfers of power.",
    "A pragmatic reform would preserve states' role while ensuring every vote carries comparable weight by moving away from winner-take-all toward proportional or district-based allocation and encouraging interstate steps toward a national popular outcome. Paired with uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and clear recount rules, such changes can reduce swing-state distortion and partisan distrust. Implemented gradually with bipartisan oversight, they aim to strengthen turnout and make results feel legitimate across urban and rural communities.",
    "Update the system to reward broad, nationwide support without erasing state voices\u2014implement proportional allocation or ranked-choice voting within states and pursue a National Popular Vote compact as consensus grows. Coupling any shift with uniform election-administration standards, transparent audits, and protections for small-state representation will build trust and reduce zero-sum campaigning.",
    "Balance federalism and democratic equality by reforming electoral rules so that individual ballots matter equally\u2014through proportional electors, district-based adjustments with anti-gerrymander safeguards, or a carefully phased national popular vote mechanism. Reinforce those changes with consistent access rules, auditable counts, and clear recount procedures to preserve stability and public confidence.",
    "Find a middle path that keeps states central to election administration while aligning outcomes more closely with the popular will by ending rigid winner-take-all allocations in favor of proportional splits, district methods, or ranked-choice mechanisms. Establish nationwide minimum standards for ballot access, security, and post-election audits to address integrity concerns shared across the political spectrum. Phased, bipartisan implementation will make reforms durable and encourage candidates to campaign broadly rather than focus on a handful of swing areas.",
    "A common-sense reform agenda blends respect for state autonomy with equal-weight voting by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation and exploring a National Popular Vote compact, all backed by clear, uniform rules for counting, auditing, and access. Prioritizing transparency, short-term phased changes, and protections for smaller and rural communities can lower partisan tensions and increase participation.",
    "Americans should pursue pragmatic reforms that keep states central to administration while ensuring every vote carries comparable weight\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors, district\u2011based methods with anti\u2011gerrymandering safeguards, or a carefully phased interstate popular\u2011vote compact. Any change must be paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts to build bipartisan trust, encourage broader campaigning, and protect smaller and rural communities.",
    "A constructive path is to bridge federalism and democratic equality by adopting measures that reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014like proportional elector allocation, ranked\u2011choice voting, or a national popular\u2011vote compact implemented gradually. Reforms should include uniform rules for voter access, auditable paper trails, and transparent recount standards. The priority must be to reward coalition\u2011building, expand participation, and preserve confidence across urban and rural communities.",
    "Reforming the process should focus on fairness, simplicity, and stability by keeping state roles in running elections while making outcomes reflect the popular will more closely through proportional allocation or a phased interstate compact. Coupling procedural fixes\u2014uniform access, anti\u2011gerrymandering measures, robust audits, and clear recount rules\u2014with incentives for candidates to campaign broadly can reduce polarization and make results widely accepted.",
    "Practical reform finds middle ground: preserve the federal structure but end winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions through district or proportional allocations, and explore a national popular vote with safeguards. Any reform must be incremental, bipartisan, and accompanied by national standards for election administration, audits, and recounts. That combination protects small\u2011state influence, makes every ballot more meaningful, and rebuilds public trust.",
    "The goal should be a transparent, trustworthy system that balances state sovereignty with the principle of one person, one vote\u2014achieved by reforms such as proportional electors, ranked\u2011choice voting, or an interstate compact implemented with clear guardrails. Building uniform standards for access, security, and audits while phasing changes will encourage broad acceptance and keep candidates accountable to voters nationwide.",
    "To strengthen legitimacy while preserving federalism, the presidential selection system should ensure every vote carries comparable weight by moving toward proportional or district-based allocation of electors and by enabling an interstate compact or amended rules to align outcomes with the national popular will. Reforms must be paired with uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and clear recount procedures so changes are transparent, gradual, and trusted across urban and rural communities.",
    "Bridging reform should keep states central to administering elections while reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014through proportional allocation of electoral votes, congressional\u2011district methods with anti\u2011gerrymandering safeguards, or a well\u2011crafted national popular\u2011vote compact. Complementary measures like ranked\u2011choice voting, uniform security and access standards, and automatic recount triggers will encourage coalition\u2011building and broader turnout. Implemented incrementally and transparently, these steps can protect smaller states\u2019 voices and make results reflect the public\u2019s will.",
    "A practical compromise is to preserve the state\u2011based framework but require that electors reflect vote shares more accurately\u2014by proportional awards or a district\u2011based split\u2014while enabling a national popular\u2011vote mechanism once a robust set of safeguards and uniform practices are in place. Stronger transparency, auditing, and voter access policies will be necessary to build bipartisan confidence and ensure peaceful, trusted transitions.",
    "Reforms should center on two shared goals: one person, one vote, and a durable federal balance that keeps smaller and rural communities engaged. That can be achieved by pairing proportional or ranked\u2011choice allocation of electors and an interstate popular\u2011vote compact with nationwide standards for ballot security, clear recount rules, and protections against gerrymandering. Phased implementation and bipartisan oversight will make the system easier to understand and more widely accepted.",
    "The best path forward preserves states\u2019 role in running elections while making outcomes more reflective of the national popular will, through proportional allocation, district\u2011based splitting, or a carefully structured interstate compact leading to a popular\u2011vote outcome. Coupling any change with ranked\u2011choice voting where appropriate, consistent rules on voter access and ID, auditable paper trails, and standardized recount processes will reduce incentives for partisan gamesmanship. Incremental reforms and clear public education can ease concerns that small states will be ignored and shift politics toward coalition\u2011building. Ultimately, a transparent, secure, and gradual approach can reconcile competing priorities and strengthen democratic legitimacy.",
    "A practical reform agenda pairs equal-weight voting with respect for states by moving away from winner-take-all toward proportional or district-based allocation of electors and offering a path to a national popular-vote compact as consensus builds. Any change should be accompanied by uniform, transparent safeguards\u2014auditable paper trails, clear recount rules, and strong access protections\u2014to bolster trust, encourage broad campaigning, and protect smaller-state concerns.",
    "Reforms should seek middle ground: preserve state administration but reduce distortions by adopting proportional allocation or ranked-choice ballots and by phasing in a National Popular Vote compact where feasible. Coupling structural changes with consistent, national standards for ballot security, audits, and timely counts will make outcomes more legitimate and reward coalition-building across urban and rural communities.",
    "Keep the federalist role of states while making every vote count by ending winner-take-all and using proportional or district methods, complemented by ranked-choice voting to ensure broader support for the winner. Pair these reforms with clear, uniform rules for voter access, verifiable counting, and recounts so the system is transparent, resilient, and less dependent on a handful of swing states.",
    "A balanced approach modernizes the Electoral College through proportional or district-based elector allocation and an orderly transition toward a national popular-vote mechanism, rather than abrupt constitutional upheaval. Robust national baselines for election administration\u2014audits, paper ballots, and standardized recount procedures\u2014should accompany any change to build bipartisan confidence and encourage campaigns to compete broadly.",
    "One pragmatic path is to preserve state influence while reducing \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d harm: require proportional or district splits of electors, pilot ranked-choice systems, and allow states to join a National Popular Vote compact over time. Tie structural reforms to uniform safeguards\u2014transparent audits, accessible voting, and clear recount rules\u2014so results are credible, every ballot feels meaningful, and smaller states remain heard."
