    "Public safety and civil rights are best advanced together through transparent policies, independent oversight, and measurable outcomes that prioritize harm reduction over arrests alone. Officers need consistent training, mental\u2011health support, and community collaboration to respond proportionately and humanely. When accountability is visible and alternatives to enforcement are funded, trust rises and both safety and liberty improve.",
    "Policing should be guided by clear standards, open data, and accountable practices that protect people and their rights while enabling effective crime prevention. Embedding de\u2011escalation, independent review, and community\u2011led prevention\u2014especially mental\u2011health and social services\u2014creates practical, common\u2011ground solutions that keep neighborhoods safe and dignified."
