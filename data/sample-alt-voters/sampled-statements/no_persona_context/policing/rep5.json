    "Policing should be governed by measurable standards that prioritize de\u2011escalation, cultural competency, and the least\u2011intrusive intervention necessary to keep communities safe. Transparent, independent review and accessible complaint processes ensure rights are protected while officers receive the support needed to improve. Redirecting nonviolent calls to trained social\u2011service teams reduces harm and lets law enforcement focus on genuine threats.",
    "Balance is achieved when officers are well\u2011trained, accountable, and partnered with the communities they serve, backed by independent oversight and data\u2011driven policies that guard civil liberties. Investing in alternatives to armed response\u2014mental\u2011health teams, restorative practices, and prevention programs\u2014reduces conflict and strengthens trust across diverse neighborhoods."
