    "Effective public safety depends on respect for individual dignity: policies must combine measurable accountability\u2014independent review, open data, and clear use-of-force limits\u2014with sustained community engagement and crisis-response alternatives staffed by mental-health and social-service professionals. This balanced approach strengthens trust, reduces conflict, and enables fair, efficient policing.",
    "Communities and police can find common ground by prioritizing prevention, de-escalation, and proportional enforcement alongside robust civilian oversight and transparent metrics that emphasize reductions in harm rather than arrests alone. Supporting officers with training, mental-health resources, and clear standards while expanding non-police response options preserves safety without sacrificing civil liberties.",
    "A practical framework for policing centers clear rules, routine de-escalation and cultural-competency training, and independent accountability, coupled with investments in social services and community-led solutions to address root causes of harm. By measuring outcomes, protecting rights, and treating officers and residents with dignity, this approach builds sustainable safety and shared trust.",
    "Policing should be grounded in both law enforcement effectiveness and protection of civil liberties, using transparent oversight, data-driven practices, and crisis-response teams to minimize confrontations and ensure fairness. Emphasizing community partnerships, restorative options, and officer support creates safer neighborhoods while upholding constitutional rights."
