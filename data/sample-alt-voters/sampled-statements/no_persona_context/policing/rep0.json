    "Policing should be governed by clear, enforceable standards and continual evaluation that center de-escalation, procedural fairness, and proportional responses, while expanding partnerships with social services and community voices. Transparent oversight and data-driven practices create accountability that strengthens legitimacy and public safety.",
    "Communities are safest when policing is professional, accountable, and paired with non-police crisis supports: prioritize de-escalation and bias-aware training, enforce independent oversight and timely redress, and invest in mental health, housing, and prevention. Such a practical, evidence-based blend protects both neighborhoods and individual rights."
