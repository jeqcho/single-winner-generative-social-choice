Coupling these standards with efficient administration, employer accountability, and targeted border management reconciles security concerns with the economic and moral case for welcoming immigrants.",
    "Immigration policy should uphold the rule of law and secure borders while treating migrants with dignity and preserving family unity. A fair, transparent path to citizenship should be earned through background checks, tax and legal compliance, and demonstrated integration\u2014such as basic English and civics\u2014paired with timely processing and targeted supports like language and job training. Streamlining legal channels, protecting refugees, and aligning admissions with labor needs can reduce irregular migration and strengthen communities.",
    "A balanced immigration framework protects national security and the rule of law while honoring human dignity and family unity through humane, predictable processes. It should provide an attainable, earned path to citizenship that requires vetting and civic integration, rewards economic contribution, and invests in services that help newcomers integrate and contribute to local communities.",
    "Effective immigration policy pairs secure, orderly enforcement with compassionate, practical pathways that recognize immigrants' economic and civic contributions. Eligibility for citizenship should be transparent and earned\u2014incorporating background checks, language and civics requirements, and evidence of lawful work or community service\u2014while preserving due process and protections for refugees and vulnerable families. By streamlining legal immigration and investing in integration supports, policy can bridge concerns about security and fairness and foster shared prosperity.",
    "Policy should marry accountability with opportunity: uphold borders and clear, enforceable rules while offering a realistic route to citizenship for those who demonstrate commitment through work, tax compliance, and civic learning. Complementing enforcement with efficient processing, family reunification, and integration programs creates safer, stronger communities.",
    "A unifying immigration approach centers on fairness, public safety, and inclusion by balancing enforcement with humane treatment and family preservation. Citizenship pathways should be transparent, timely, and merit- and contribution-informed\u2014requiring vetting, basic language and civics knowledge, and measures of economic self-sufficiency\u2014while ensuring asylum protections and support for integration. Such policies reduce incentives for irregular migration, respect national sovereignty, and enable newcomers to fully participate in civic and economic life."
