    "Respect for the Second Amendment should be matched by pragmatic, measurable policies that reduce harm without disenfranchising lawful owners, emphasizing prevention, accountability, and proportionality. Combining reasonable screening, education and safe-storage standards, narrowly targeted interventions with due process, and community support programs can unite diverse perspectives around common goals of safety and liberty.",
    "The right to keep and bear arms and the duty to protect communities can be reconciled through narrowly tailored, evidence-based policies that focus on preventing misuse while preserving lawful ownership. Practical steps\u2014such as comprehensive background checks, secure-storage expectations, accessible safety training, and narrowly targeted risk interventions with robust due process\u2014reduce accidents and violence without disarming responsible citizens. Transparent enforcement and investment in mental-health and community prevention build trust and shared accountability.",
    "Protecting Second Amendment liberties should go hand in hand with commonsense, enforceable safeguards that keep firearms out of the hands of those who pose a clear risk.

    "Reasonable gun policy treats firearm ownership as a protected right that carries responsibilities to keep others safe. Policies should be narrowly focused, data-driven, and enforceable\u2014centering on thorough background checks, secure storage standards, accessible training, and due-process protections for any temporary risk removal. Supporting community-based violence prevention and mental-health services addresses root causes beyond regulations. This blended approach preserves lawful self-defense and sporting traditions while reducing avoidable tragedies and building cross\u2011partisan trust.",

Clear laws, consistent enforcement, and community investment foster accountability and mutual respect."
