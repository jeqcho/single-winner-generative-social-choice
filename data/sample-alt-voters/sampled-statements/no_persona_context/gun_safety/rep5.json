Emphasizing prevention\u2014secure storage, meaningful vetting, training, and community-based supports\u2014keeps weapons from dangerous hands without unduly burdening law-abiding owners.",
    "We can respect constitutional freedoms and also fulfill a civic duty to prevent needless harm by adopting commonsense, narrowly tailored policies that focus on risk rather than punitive, broad bans. Effective measures include robust background checks, safe-storage rules, accessible safety education, and evidence-based interventions for those demonstrably dangerous, all enforced consistently and fairly. Safeguards must protect due process and avoid creating unnecessary barriers for responsible citizens who use firearms for defense, work, or sport. Framing reforms around responsibility, community wellbeing, and data helps build trust and durable compromise.",
    "Finding common ground means acknowledging the right to bear arms while insisting on practical steps that reduce accidents and violent misuse. Investments in research, mental-health resources, and enforcement against illegal trafficking, combined with reasonable background checks, training, and storage standards, create a balanced framework. This approach protects lawful ownership, strengthens public safety, and opens space for civil dialogue.",
    "Protecting the right to bear arms and preventing needless harm are both essential; sensible, narrowly tailored laws\u2014like universal background checks, secure-storage requirements, and short-term risk orders with clear due process\u2014can keep firearms from dangerous hands while preserving lawful ownership. Policies should be evidence-based, enforceable, and paired with accessible training and mental-health supports to build community trust.",
    "A durable middle ground honors the Second Amendment while reducing preventable harm by focusing on practical, evidence-driven measures: thorough background checks, mandated safe storage and training, and narrowly drawn interventions for high-risk individuals that respect due process. Transparent enforcement, investment in prevention, and respectful civic dialogue help sustain both liberty and public safety.",
    "Balancing constitutional rights and community safety means treating firearms with responsibility: preserve lawful self-defense and sporting traditions while implementing common-sense safeguards such as comprehensive vetting, secure storage practices, and targeted risk-based restrictions with procedural protections. Combining data-driven policy, consistent enforcement, and investment in mental-health and violence prevention creates trust across diverse perspectives.",
    "We can protect individual freedoms and reduce violence by adopting narrowly tailored, enforceable safety measures\u2014universal background checks, safe-storage standards, mandatory training, and time-limited red-flag orders with rigorous due process\u2014while safeguarding lawful ownership for self-defense and recreation. Centering policy on evidence, clear standards, and community support will bridge differences and make public spaces safer.",
    "Common ground is found in recognizing that rights come with responsibilities: uphold the Second Amendment while enacting pragmatic, evidence-based rules\u2014secure storage, meaningful background checks, accessible safety training, and targeted interventions for those at demonstrable risk\u2014that prevent misuse without disarming law\u2011abiding citizens. Emphasizing due process, transparent enforcement, and investments in prevention and mental health fosters cooperation and reduces harm."
