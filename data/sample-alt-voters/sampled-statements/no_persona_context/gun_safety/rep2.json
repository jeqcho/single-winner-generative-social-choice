    "Practical policy should treat firearms like other potentially dangerous tools: preserve lawful ownership while minimizing risks through data-driven, narrowly tailored safeguards.

    "A durable middle ground respects individual liberty while insisting on clear, enforceable measures that keep guns out of the hands of people likely to harm themselves or others. Reasonable policies\u2014thorough background checks, mandatory safety education, secure-storage requirements, and narrowly drawn extreme-risk laws with strong due process\u2014address risk without sweeping bans. Complementing these rules with investments in mental-health care, community violence prevention, and technology that improves safety can further reduce harm. Transparent implementation and consistent, non-discriminatory enforcement will help sustain public trust across communities.",
