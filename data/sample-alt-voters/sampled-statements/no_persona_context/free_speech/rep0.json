    "Free speech should be broadly protected as the engine of democratic debate, while narrowly and clearly limiting speech that constitutes direct threats, imminent incitement to violence, or coordinated, sustained harassment that silences or endangers people. Limits should be defined by objective standards, enforced with due process, and complemented by education, restorative remedies, and vigorous counterspeech so that safety and dignity are protected without needlessly chilling legitimate dissent. This balanced approach preserves open inquiry while reducing foreseeable harm to vulnerable communities.",
    "A healthy public sphere defends robust expression but accepts narrowly tailored restrictions on speech that predictably causes imminent physical harm, true threats, or targeted campaigns of intimidation. Those rules must be precise, transparent, and accompanied by fair procedures, plus investment in education, community dialogue, and platform accountability to address hateful attitudes non\u2011criminally when possible. Together these measures protect both liberty and the safety and dignity of vulnerable people.",
    "Free expression and human dignity are mutually important: speech that challenges power and advances learning should be protected, while speech that intentionally incites violence, issues credible threats, or engages in persistent targeted harassment should be restricted. Any limits must be narrowly defined, applied consistently with due process, and reinforced by restorative practices, education, and counterspeech to heal harms and preserve space for legitimate disagreement. This synthesis seeks common ground between safeguarding liberty and preventing real\u2011world harm.",
    "Society should safeguard open debate but draw bright, narrow lines against speech that directly incites imminent lawless action, constitutes true threats, or systematically silences and endangers people through coordinated harassment. Clear legal standards, fair enforcement, and complementary non\u2011criminal responses\u2014education, restorative justice, and strong counterspeech\u2014allow communities to protect safety and dignity while minimizing unnecessary censorship. This pragmatic balance honors both free expression and communal responsibility.",
    "Protecting free speech requires recognizing that it is not absolute where words are used to threaten, incite immediate violence, or carry out organized, sustained harassment that deprives people of equal participation. Limitations should be narrowly targeted, evidence\u2011based, and implemented with procedural safeguards, while broader harms are best addressed through education, community norms, and restorative processes that foster understanding rather than blanket suppression. Such a framework reconciles the need for open discourse with the obligation to protect vulnerable members of society.",
    "Free expression is a cornerstone of democratic life, but it must be balanced with narrowly defined limits that prohibit direct incitement to imminent violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment that deprive people of safety and equal participation. Such limits should be precise, applied with due process, and paired with education, restorative practices, and robust counter-speech to address harmful attitudes without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open debate and protecting people from real harm are both essential goals, so speech should generally be free while narrowly restricting only true threats, imminent calls to violence, and coordinated harassment that foreseeably causes harm. Complementary tools\u2014clear enforcement standards, transparent procedures, education, and community-driven restorative responses\u2014can uphold dignity without silencing dissenting or unpopular ideas.",
    "A healthy public sphere defends broad free speech but accepts narrowly tailored limits where words intentionally and imminently endanger others through threats, incitement, or persistent targeted abuse. To preserve robust discourse, those narrow limits must be accompanied by due process, precise definitions, and investments in counterspeech, civic education, and restorative remedies that address root causes and protect vulnerable communities.",
    "Free speech and public safety can be reconciled by upholding open debate while prohibiting only speech that directly and imminently causes harm\u2014such as true threats, incitement to violence, or coordinated harassment\u2014and enforcing those rules transparently and narrowly. Emphasizing education, community norms, and restorative approaches alongside legal protections helps prevent abuse without turning debate into censorship.",
    "Democratic freedom of expression should be robust, but it need not extend to speech that clearly aims to produce violence, terrorize individuals, or silence groups through sustained harassment; narrowly targeted prohibitions on such conduct, enforced with clear standards and due process, protect safety and dignity. At the same time, counterspeech, education, and restorative practices should be central tools for addressing offensive or hateful ideas that fall short of actionable harm.",
    "Free expression is vital to democratic life, but it should not protect direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that endangers people. Limits must be narrowly defined, applied with due process, and paired with education, restorative responses, and vigorous counter-speech to preserve open debate while protecting dignity and safety.",
    "A healthy balance recognizes that robust debate and artistic freedom are essential while narrowly prohibiting speech that intentionally causes imminent harm\u2014true threats, coordinated harassment, and calls for violence. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement, and community-based remedies like education and restorative practices can protect vulnerable people without chilling legitimate dissent.",
    "Protecting free speech and protecting people from harm are complementary goals: laws should target conduct\u2014incitement, credible threats, and targeted harassment\u2014not unpopular ideas. Emphasizing precise definitions, due process, platform accountability, and investment in education and counterspeech fosters both safety and an open marketplace of ideas.",
    "Free speech should remain broad enough for dissent, satire, and inquiry, yet narrow, objective limits are justified where expression foreseeably produces violence, credible threats, or sustained suppression of others\u2019 participation. Combining narrowly tailored legal rules with transparent procedures, education, and restorative community responses offers a principled way to uphold liberty and dignity.",
    "A principled approach upholds liberty while preventing tangible harm by permitting open debate but prohibiting imminent incitement, true threats, and sustained targeted harassment. Clear, narrowly tailored laws enforced with due process alongside counterspeech, education, and restorative measures strike practical common ground between free expression and protection of vulnerable communities.",
    "Free speech is essential for democratic debate and cultural life, yet it must be balanced with narrowly defined limits that prevent direct threats, imminent calls to violence, and sustained targeted harassment that deprive people of safety and equal participation. Clear legal standards, fair enforcement and due process should be paired with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech so that harmful conduct is addressed while robust, even unpopular ideas remain protected.",
    "Protecting open expression is vital, but reasonable, precisely drawn restrictions are justified for speech that intentionally incites imminent harm, makes credible threats, or coordinates harassment that silences vulnerable people. Those limits should be coupled with transparent rules, due process, and investments in education, community dialogue, and counterspeech to minimize chilling effects and promote accountability and healing.",
    "Free expression and the protection of human dignity can coexist by defending robust debate while prohibiting narrowly specified harms\u2014true threats, direct incitement to violence, and sustained targeted harassment\u2014using clear standards and fair procedures. Complementing legal limits with restorative responses, public education, and active counter-speech helps address hateful attitudes without resorting to broad censorship.",
    "Democratic discourse requires strong protection for speech, but not as a shield for conduct that foreseeably produces violence, intimidation, or systematic exclusion; narrowly tailored laws should target only those concrete harms. To preserve open inquiry and prevent abuse, enforceable definitions, due process, platform accountability, and community-centered education and restorative approaches should work together to protect both liberty and safety.",
    "Upholding free speech means allowing vigorous disagreement while drawing precise, minimal boundaries against speech that directly threatens, incites imminent lawless action, or engages in coordinated harassment that silences others. Paired with clear legal standards, transparent enforcement, and non\u2011punitive tools\u2014education, counterspeech, and restorative justice\u2014this approach seeks common ground between protecting expression and safeguarding vulnerable communities.",
    "Free speech is foundational to democracy and should protect robust debate, but it is not absolute; narrowly tailored limits are justified to prohibit true threats, direct incitement to imminent violence, and sustained targeted harassment. Wherever possible, responses should prioritize clear legal standards with due process, restorative practices, education, and vigorous counterspeech so harmful conduct is addressed without chilling legitimate expression.",
    "Protecting open expression and protecting people from harm are both vital, so limits should focus only on speech that intentionally and imminently threatens violence, constitutes credible threats, or coordinates targeted harassment. Complementary measures\u2014transparent enforcement, due process, public education, and restorative or community-based remedies\u2014can reduce harm while preserving space for difficult but lawful ideas.",
    "A balanced approach recognizes that freedom of expression fuels inquiry and dissent while also requiring narrow, precisely defined prohibitions on speech that foreseeably causes imminent harm through threats or incitement. Strong safeguards\u2014clear definitions, consistent due process, and investments in education, counterspeech, and restorative accountability\u2014reconcile protection of vulnerable people with preservation of robust public discourse.",
    "We should defend broad, open debate while drawing tight legal lines around direct calls for violence, true threats, and systematic harassment that silences or endangers others. Emphasizing transparency, narrow drafting, and noncriminal tools like education, community norms, and counterspeech helps protect dignity without empowering undue censorship.",
    "Free expression and human dignity can coexist when limits are narrowly tailored to prevent imminent violence, credible threats, and persistent targeted harassment, and when enforcement is guided by objective standards and procedural fairness. Pairing modest legal boundaries with vigorous counterspeech, civic education, and restorative community responses offers a pragmatic path that preserves debate and shields vulnerable people from real harm.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected as essential to democracy, but narrowly limited where speech intentionally and imminently threatens or incites violence or constitutes sustained targeted harassment. Clear, narrowly defined legal standards with due process, paired with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech, balance safety and dignity with robust public debate.",
    "Protecting open debate and artistic expression is crucial, yet society should not tolerate speech that makes credible threats, calls for immediate violence, or systematically silences vulnerable people. Limits must be narrowly tailored, precisely defined, and enforced with transparent procedures to avoid chilling legitimate dissent. Complementary measures\u2014education, community dialogue, and platform policies\u2014should address harmful attitudes without broad censorship.",
    "A balanced approach defends free expression while prohibiting direct incitement, true threats, and coordinated harassment that foreseeably cause harm. Emphasizing narrow legal boundaries, due process, and non-criminal remedies like counterspeech and restorative justice protects both liberty and dignity.",
    "Free expression and protection from harm are compatible goals when restrictions focus only on speech that presents a clear, imminent danger or constitutes targeted abuse. Laws should be precise and limited to those harms, while schools, platforms, and communities invest in education, accountability, and restorative responses. This preserves space for unpopular ideas while shielding people from real-world violence and intimidation.",
    "Defending robust debate requires resisting vague censorship, yet protecting people from credible threats, direct incitement, and sustained harassment is a legitimate and narrowly circumscribed aim. Any limits should be defined by clear evidence of intent or imminent harm and applied with transparent procedures and appeals. Outside those narrow cases, offensive speech is best countered through education, counterspeech, and community norms. Combining precise law with restorative and civic responses preserves both free expression and social safety.",
    "Free expression is essential to democratic life, but narrowly tailored limits are justified where speech directly incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment that harms people's safety and dignity. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement with due process, and investments in education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech can protect vulnerable communities while preserving open debate.",
    "A healthy public sphere both defends robust expression and protects people from direct harm; reasonable, precisely defined prohibitions on true threats, imminent incitement, and coordinated harassment strike that balance. Enforcement should be narrowly focused, procedurally fair, and supplemented by education, community norms, and restorative remedies. Platforms and institutions should favor counterspeech and support for those harmed over broad censorship.",
    "Free speech should remain broad so ideas can be contested and art and dissent flourish, yet it should not shield words that foreseeably lead to violence or systematically degrade and silence vulnerable groups. Prioritizing narrow, objective legal limits on imminent harm alongside civic education, transparent policies, and restorative responses builds common ground between liberty and safety.",
    "Protecting expression and preventing hate's real-world harms are compatible goals when limits focus only on conduct that causes imminent danger\u2014such as direct incitement and credible threats\u2014and are enforced transparently with clear definitions and appeal rights. Outside those narrow cases, offensive or unpopular speech is best met with counterspeech, social accountability, and educational initiatives. This combined approach respects free inquiry while upholding the dignity and safety of all community members.",
    "Societies should vigorously guard freedom of expression while adopting narrowly tailored, evidence-based prohibitions on speech that directly incites violence, makes true threats, or intentionally targets individuals for sustained harassment. Coupling these legal boundaries with due process, public education, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech preserves open debate and protects vulnerable people.",
    "Free speech is essential to democracy and to the contest of ideas, but it is not absolute; narrowly defined limits are warranted for direct threats, imminent incitement to violence, and sustained targeted harassment that cause real harm. Those limits should be precise, applied with due process, and complemented by education, restorative remedies, and robust counterspeech to protect dignity while preserving open debate.",
    "Protecting robust expression while preventing harm requires a focused balance: prohibit true threats, calls for imminent violence, and coordinated campaigns that silence or endanger people, but avoid vague bans that chill legitimate dissent. Legal standards should be clear, narrowly tailored, and enforced transparently with procedural safeguards. Community education, platform accountability, and restorative approaches should address hateful attitudes without substituting broad censorship.",
    "Common-sense guardrails on speech should target conduct that foreseeably produces violence or pervasive harassment rather than unpopular or offensive ideas. Combining narrowly tailored legal prohibitions with investment in counterspeech, civic education, and equitable support for harmed communities preserves both safety and free inquiry.",
    "Free expression and human dignity are both democratic values that can be reconciled by defining narrow, objective limits on speech that intentionally incites imminent lawless action, issues credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment. Enforcement must be proportionate, transparent, and accompanied by appeals and due process to prevent abuse. Outside those narrow boundaries, social consequences, dialogue, and countering ideas are the appropriate tools for addressing hateful or offensive views.",
    "A principled approach affirms that speech essential to art, scholarship, and political debate deserves strong protection, while speech that directly threatens safety or organizes violence does not. Narrow, clearly articulated legal limits focused on intent and imminent harm provide the minimal restraint necessary to protect vulnerable people. Complementary strategies\u2014education, restorative justice, platform policies, and vigorous counterspeech\u2014tackle the roots and effects of hatred without silencing difficult but lawful expression. Transparent rules and community-based remedies help maintain trust that free speech is being preserved, not needlessly curtailed.",
    "Free expression is vital for democratic life and cultural flourishing, but it does not protect direct threats, imminent calls to violence, or sustained targeted harassment that deprive people of safety or equal participation. Limits should be narrowly tailored, clearly defined, and applied with transparent due process so they address concrete harms without chilling legitimate debate. Complementing legal rules with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech strengthens social resilience and preserves space for dissent.",
    "Protecting free speech and protecting vulnerable people are both essential goals, and a practical middle path is to forbid only speech that intentionally and imminently causes harm\u2014true threats, direct incitement to violence, and coordinated harassment\u2014while leaving controversial or offensive ideas open to counterspeech. Policies should be precise, evidence-based, and paired with education, community norms, and fair enforcement to avoid overbroad censorship.",
    "Enshrining broad freedom of expression while imposing narrow, well\u2011defined limits on speech that foreseeably produces imminent physical harm or sustained intimidation reconciles liberty with safety. Emphasizing clear legal standards, due process, transparent enforcement, and nonpunitive responses like education and restorative dialogue helps prevent abuse of power and fosters constructive public debate.",
    "A shared, balanced approach defends open debate but recognizes that words that amount to credible threats, calls for immediate violence, or systematic campaigns of harassment inflict real harm and may justifiably be restricted. Any restrictions must be precise, proportionate, and subject to due process, with priority given to counterspeech, education, and community-led remedies. This combination protects dignity and safety while preserving robust space for dissent, satire, and critical inquiry.",
    "Free speech should be preserved as the engine of democratic exchange, yet narrowly targeted prohibitions on threats, imminent incitement, and persistent targeted harassment are necessary to safeguard people\u2019s safety and equal participation. Accompanying these limits with transparent rules, procedural safeguards, and investments in education and restorative practices balances the values of liberty and protection.",
    "Free speech is essential to democracy and cultural life, yet narrowly defined limits on speech that intentionally threatens, directly incites imminent violence, or systematically targets individuals for sustained harassment are justified to protect safety and dignity. Such limits should be precise, applied with due process, and paired with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech so that robust debate and the protection of vulnerable people are both preserved.",
    "Protecting open, often uncomfortable debate is vital, but society should draw clear, narrowly tailored lines against true threats, imminent calls to violence, and coordinated harassment that deprive people of safety and equal participation. Transparent enforcement, procedural safeguards, and investments in education and counterspeech help balance liberty with the need to prevent tangible harm.",
    "Free expression should be broadly defended while recognizing that speech crossing into credible threats, direct incitement to imminent harm, or persistent targeted abuse can and should be limited in narrowly defined ways.

    "Free expression is fundamental to democracy and cultural life, but narrowly tailored limits should prevent direct incitement to imminent violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment; clear definitions, due process, and consistent enforcement guard against overbroad censorship. Complementary measures\u2014education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech\u2014should address hateful ideas that fall short of legal thresholds while protecting the dignity and safety of vulnerable people.",
    "Protecting robust debate while safeguarding people\u2019s safety requires that laws focus only on speech that causes or imminently threatens real-world harm\u2014true threats, calls for violence, and coordinated harassment\u2014while leaving offensive but nonviolent views to be fought with counterspeech and civic education. Transparent rules, narrow legal tests, and fair appeal processes help maintain both liberty and social trust.",
    "A balanced approach recognizes free speech as essential but not absolute: narrow, precisely defined prohibitions on incitement, credible threats, and targeted intimidation should coexist with protections for dissent, satire, and academic inquiry. Investing in education, platform transparency, and restorative community remedies complements legal limits and builds common ground across differing perspectives.",
    "Free speech must be vigorously defended, yet civic norms and law should act to stop speech that predictably produces imminent violence or sustained harm to identifiable people or groups; such limits should be narrowly drawn and applied with procedural safeguards. Emphasizing counter-speech, education, and restorative responses preserves open debate and helps heal harms without resorting to sweeping bans.",
    "Freedom of expression and protection from hate are both democratic imperatives, so boundaries are justified only where speech directly and foreseeably causes harm\u2014such as incitement, true threats, or organized harassment\u2014and must be enforced through clear, narrow standards and due process. Outside those narrow harms, societies should rely on education, robust counterspeech, and community accountability to confront bigotry while preserving debate.",
    "Free speech is fundamental to democratic life, but it must be balanced with protections for safety and dignity by narrowly prohibiting true threats, direct incitement to imminent violence, and sustained targeted harassment; such limits should target conduct, not ideas. Where possible, prefer transparent rules, due process, restorative remedies, education, and vigorous counterspeech to address hateful attitudes without unduly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Upholding open expression and protecting vulnerable people are both essential, so legal limits should be tightly confined to speech that foreseeably causes imminent harm\u2014threats, calls to violence, or coordinated intimidation\u2014while noncriminal but harmful rhetoric should be met with education, platform accountability, and community-based restorative practices. Clear definitions, even-handed enforcement, and robust counterspeech preserve honest debate while reducing real-world damage.",
    "Free expression should be broadly protected as the engine of debate and creativity, yet society can reasonably restrict narrowly defined speech that directly incites violence or constitutes credible, targeted threats; such boundaries must be precise, evidence-based, and subject to due process. Complementary tools\u2014education, restorative justice, and active counterspeech\u2014are vital to change harmful norms without resorting to sweeping censorship.",
    "Balancing liberty and safety means defending robust debate while imposing limited, well-specified prohibitions on speech that intentionally and imminently endangers others or systematically silences groups through harassment or threats. Emphasizing clear legal standards, transparency, and nonpunitive responses like education and community dialogue builds common ground and protects both free expression and human dignity.",
    "Free speech should remain a broad public good, but narrowly tailored limits are justified for direct incitement, true threats, and persistent targeted harassment that produce concrete harms; enforcement should focus on conduct, not controversial ideas, and include safeguards against abuse. At the same time, investing in education, restorative processes, and vigorous counterspeech helps heal divisions and preserves the space for difficult but legitimate expression.",
    "Free expression is essential to democracy and cultural life, but it should not shelter direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that causes real harm.

Complementary measures\u2014transparent legal standards, due process, community education, platform accountability, and restorative responses\u2014can reduce harm without chilling legitimate expression.",
    "Protecting free speech means guarding space for dissent and artistic expression while also preventing speech that predictably causes violence, intimidation, or exclusion. Narrow legal limits tied to intent and imminent harm, plus investment in education, counterspeech, and restorative community practices, offer pragmatic common ground.",
    "Free speech should be broadly preserved to foster debate and learning, but not as a shield for direct calls to violence, credible threats, or persistent harassment that silences participants. Clear, narrowly tailored rules, fair enforcement, and non\u2011criminal remedies like education and community repair can uphold both liberty and the safety of vulnerable people.",

Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement, and investments in education, community norms, and counterspeech offer ways to protect dignity and safety without resorting to broad censorship.",
    "Protecting both liberty and human dignity means narrowly tailoring limits to conduct that foreseeably leads to violence or sustained exclusion, especially in vulnerable settings like schools and workplaces. Outside that narrow band, society should rely on counter-speech, platform policies, and restorative measures to address hateful or offensive ideas while preserving robust debate.",
    "Common ground is found by distinguishing harmful conduct from unpopular ideas: prohibit imminent incitement, true threats, and targeted campaigns of harassment, while safeguarding controversial but nonviolent speech. Any restrictions must be precise, evidence\u2011based, and paired with due process, education, and civic remedies that promote understanding rather than suppression.",
    "Free expression flourishes when legal limits are minimal and narrowly focused on preventing direct violence and credible threats, while communities and institutions use education, restorative justice, and counterspeech to confront prejudice. Transparent rules and consistent enforcement ensure safety without turning disagreement into censorship.",

Complementary measures\u2014education, restorative practices, platform accountability, and vigorous counterspeech\u2014should address offensive but non\u2011criminal ideas and strengthen civic norms.",
    "Protecting broad freedom of speech preserves debate and dissent, yet a reasonable boundary exists where words intentionally and imminently call for violence, make credible threats, or coordinate harassment; precise, transparent enforcement of narrow limits minimizes chilling effects. Communities, institutions, and platforms should prioritize education, restorative remedies, and counter\u2011speech to rebuild trust and include vulnerable voices.",
    "A balanced approach defends expressive freedom while recognizing that speech crossing into true threats, direct incitement to imminent lawless action, or coordinated harassment inflicts real harm and may be lawfully restricted.

Any limits should be precisely defined, evidence-based, and applied with clear procedural protections to avoid chilling legitimate dissent. For speech that is offensive but non-violent, society should prioritize counterspeech, education, and restorative accountability. This combined legal and civic strategy seeks to protect both liberty and human dignity.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected to sustain democratic debate, but narrowly constrained to prohibit true threats, direct incitement to imminent violence, and sustained targeted harassment that causes real harm. Limits must be precise, enforced with clear due process, and complemented by education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech to protect dignity without suppressing legitimate dissent.",
    "A balanced approach defends robust expression while recognizing that words that foreseeably produce violence or systematically silence vulnerable people warrant narrow legal limits. Those limits should focus on intent and imminent harm, include transparent procedures and due process, and avoid vague bans that chill art, scholarship, or political dissent. Investment in education, community norms, and platforms\u2019 proportionate policies should address hateful attitudes alongside legal safeguards.",
    "Protecting free expression and protecting people from harm are both democratic values that can coexist: narrow, well-defined prohibitions on credible threats, direct incitement, and coordinated harassment protect safety while leaving space for contentious but nonviolent debate. Emphasizing clear legal standards, consistent enforcement, and noncriminal remedies like education and restorative accountability helps reconcile liberty with dignity.",
    "Free speech should remain the rule for open inquiry and cultural life, yet it need not shelter calls for violence, true threats, or persistent targeted abuse that threaten safety and equal participation. Any restrictions must be narrowly tailored, evidence-based, and applied with robust procedural safeguards to prevent abuse. Outside narrowly defined harms, counter-speech, civic education, and community-based remediation are preferable to censorship. This combined legal and social strategy preserves democratic debate while protecting vulnerable people.",
    "A principled middle ground preserves broad freedom of expression while imposing narrowly tailored limits only when speech directly causes or imminently risks violence, credible threats, or systematic harassment. Clear definitions, due process, and transparent enforcement keep limits from becoming tools of censorship, and nonlegal responses\u2014education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech\u2014address offensive but noncriminal views. Together these measures protect both civic liberty and human dignity."
