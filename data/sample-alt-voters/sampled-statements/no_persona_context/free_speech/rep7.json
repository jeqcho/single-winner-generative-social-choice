    "Free expression is essential to democratic life, but it must be balanced with narrowly tailored rules that prohibit direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment; these limits should be clearly defined, enforced with due process, and focused only on preventing tangible harm. Complementary non\u2011censorial tools\u2014education, restorative practices, platform transparency, and vigorous counter\u2011speech\u2014should be prioritized to address hateful ideas while preserving room for robust, even uncomfortable, debate.",
    "Protecting free speech and protecting people are both vital, so law and policy should forbid only narrowly specified harms\u2014imminent calls to violence, true threats, and coordinated harassment\u2014while relying on education, community norms, and counterspeech to confront offensive but nonviolent views. Clear standards, transparent enforcement, and proportional remedies can minimize chilling effects and preserve a vibrant public square that safeguards dignity and safety.",
    "Freedom of expression should be robust, yet it is reasonable to constrain speech that intentionally and foreseeably causes imminent physical harm through incitement, credible threats, or targeted campaigns of harassment; such constraints must be precise, evidence\u2011based, and applied with due process. At the same time, societies should invest in education, restorative responses, and active counterspeech to reduce prejudice without resorting to broad censorship of dissenting ideas.",
    "A healthy public sphere protects candid debate while drawing narrow, objective lines against speech that directly incites violence, issues credible threats, or systematically targets individuals for harm; enforcement should be transparent and legally constrained to prevent overreach. Complementary strategies\u2014media literacy, restorative justice, and vigorous counter\u2011speech\u2014help address hateful rhetoric without silencing legitimate dissent or artistic expression.",
    "Free speech and public safety can be reconciled by restricting only speech that poses imminent, demonstrable harm\u2014such as calls for violence, true threats, and persistent targeted harassment\u2014under narrowly defined legal standards with due process and oversight. For all other offensive or unpopular speech, society should favor education, restorative accountability, platform transparency, and robust counterspeech to foster inclusion while preserving open debate.",
    "Free speech is vital to democratic life and creative inquiry, but it must be balanced with narrowly defined limits that prohibit direct incitement to imminent violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment; clear legal standards, due process, and transparent platform policies should guide enforcement. Complementary measures\u2014education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech\u2014can address offensive but noncriminal expression while protecting vulnerable communities and preserving open debate.",
    "Protecting robust, even uncomfortable, public discourse and defending human dignity are compatible goals: keep broad protections for debate and art, while restricting only speech that intentionally and imminently calls for violence, issues true threats, or organizes coordinated harassment. Ensure any limits are narrowly tailored, evidence-based, and paired with education, community norms, and remedies that repair harm without chilling legitimate expression.",
    "Free expression should remain the default in a pluralistic society, yet narrowly drawn rules are justified to stop direct threats, incitement to imminent lawless action, and persistent targeted abuse that causes real-world harm. Enforcement should rest on precise definitions, independent oversight, and due process, while investment in counterspeech, media literacy, and restorative dialogue reduces reliance on censorship.",
    "Upholding free speech and protecting safety are mutual obligations: preserve open debate and dissent, but prohibit speech that demonstrably and imminently endangers others through calls to violence, credible threats, or sustained dehumanizing harassment. Policies should be transparent, narrowly focused, and complemented by education, community accountability, and proportional remedies to heal harms without silencing legitimate voices.",
    "Democracy requires both unfettered exchange of ideas and the safeguarding of people\u2019s dignity; limits should therefore be narrow and focused on direct incitement to violence, specific threats, and organized harassment that foreseeably causes harm. Alongside precise legal and platform rules with due process, prioritize counterspeech, restorative practices, and public education to address prejudice while keeping the civic square open.",
    "Free expression is essential to democratic life, but it should not protect direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment; narrowly drawn, evidence\u2011based limits focused on imminent harm can protect safety without unduly chilling debate. Clear standards, due process, transparent platform and legal policies, and investments in education, counterspeech, and restorative remedies together preserve open discourse while safeguarding vulnerable people.",
    "Protecting robust, even uncomfortable, speech while preventing tangible harm requires a balance: criminalize true threats and imminent calls for violence, and address hateful but nonviolent rhetoric through counterspeech, education, and community accountability. Policies should be narrowly tailored, context\u2011sensitive, and enforced with transparent procedures and independent oversight so free expression and human dignity coexist.",
    "Free speech and public safety are complementary goals when rules target only narrowly defined harms\u2014direct threats, coordinated harassment, and imminent incitement\u2014while nonviolent offensive speech is met with counter\u2011speech, restorative practices, and civic education. Applying clear, objective standards with due process and platform transparency helps protect vulnerable communities without silencing legitimate dissent.",
    "Upholding a vibrant marketplace of ideas means vigorously protecting expression but drawing precise, narrowly tailored lines against speech that intends and is likely to cause immediate harm, such as true threats or organized campaigns to silence or endanger people. Complementary remedies\u2014education, counterspeech, community norms, and proportionate enforcement\u2014can reduce harm while preserving democratic debate and accountability.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected, with limited, well\u2011defined exceptions for direct incitement, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment that produce real-world harm; those limits must be transparent, evidence\u2011based, and applied with due process. Emphasizing counterspeech, restorative justice, and public education alongside narrow legal and platform rules offers a practical path to protect both liberty and dignity.",
    "Free expression is indispensable to democratic life, but it should not be a shield for direct incitement, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that foreseeably causes real harm; narrowly drawn legal limits focused on intent, imminence, and demonstrable danger can protect safety without silencing legitimate debate. Complementary non\u2011legal tools\u2014transparent platform policies, consistent due process, robust counterspeech, education, and restorative practices\u2014should be prioritized to address hateful ideas while preserving the marketplace of ideas.",
    "Protecting open debate and protecting vulnerable people are both essential goals, and common ground lies in applying clear, narrowly tailored prohibitions only to speech that poses a real, imminent risk of violence or constitutes targeted threats or harassment. Outside that narrow scope, society should rely on transparency, fair enforcement, education, and vigorous counter\u2011speech to confront prejudice without resorting to broad censorship.",
    "Free speech should be broadly defended to sustain inquiry and dissent, while narrowly defined limits against true threats, incitement to imminent harm, and coordinated harassment protect dignity and safety; such limits must be precise, evidence\u2011based, and applied with due process. At the same time, investment in media literacy, restorative remedies, and community engagement can reduce harm and preserve space for uncomfortable but lawful expression.",
    "Balancing liberty and safety means drawing a clear line against speech that intentionally and imminently provokes violence or targets individuals for sustained abuse, while guarding against vague or overbroad rules that chill legitimate dissent. Enforcement should be transparent and proportional, and supplemented by education, counterspeech, and community norms that heal harms and strengthen civic trust.",
    "Common ground recognizes that free expression is fundamental but not absolute: narrowly tailored bans on direct incitement, credible threats, and persistent targeted harassment are defensible, provided they are applied transparently and with due process. To preserve robust public discourse, legal measures should be paired with platform standards, restorative practices, and vigorous counter\u2011speech that address hateful attitudes without turning to sweeping censorship.",
    "Free expression is vital to democratic life, yet it should not shield speech that intentionally and imminently incites violence, makes credible threats, or engages in sustained, targeted harassment that deprives people of safety and equal participation. Limits addressing those clear harms must be narrowly defined, evidence\u2011based, and enforced with transparent procedures and due process, while society also invests in counterspeech, education, and restorative practices to address prejudice without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open debate and human dignity are complementary goals: speech that directly threatens or incites imminent harm should be constrained by precise legal and platform standards, but offensive or unpopular ideas that do not cause tangible danger are best countered through education, robust counterspeech, and community norms. Clear, narrowly tailored rules, applied transparently and with remedies focused on prevention and repair, can safeguard vulnerable people while preserving a lively public square.",
    "Free speech should remain broad to foster creativity and democratic exchange, yet narrowly targeted limits are justified for true threats, imminent incitement to violence, and coordinated harassment that foreseeably causes harm. Those limits must be objective, proportionate, and paired with due process, platform transparency, and investments in media literacy, restorative justice, and counter-speech to reduce harm without unnecessary censorship.",
    "Honest disagreement and cultural debate depend on robust free expression, but that freedom does not extend to speech that meaningfully and immediately endangers others; narrowly defined prohibitions on direct incitement, credible threats, and persistent targeted abuse should protect safety and dignity. Complementing legal standards with education, community accountability, and accessible restorative remedies helps repair harm and maintain open channels for dissenting voices.",
    "Balancing liberty and safety means defending wide latitude for nonviolent expression while setting clear, narrow boundaries against speech that deliberately incites violence, issues credible threats, or organizes sustained harassment. Those boundaries should be transparently enforced with due process and supplemented by counterspeech, education, and restorative approaches so vulnerable communities are protected without unduly silencing honest public debate.",
    "Free expression is foundational to democracy and should be protected so art, dissent, and civic debate can flourish; however, narrow, clearly defined limits are justified where speech intentionally and imminently incites violence, communicates credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment. Such limits must be evidence\u2011based, applied with due process, and complemented by education, restorative responses, and vigorous counter\u2011speech to address nonviolent but harmful ideas without undue censorship.",
    "Defending robust speech while protecting safety calls for a balanced approach: preserve broad protections for controversial and unpopular ideas, but prohibit direct calls for imminent violence, true threats, and coordinated campaigns that silence or endanger people. Clear legal standards, transparent platform rules, procedural safeguards, and investments in education and counterspeech together minimize harm while keeping public discourse open.",
    "Free speech and dignity can coexist when limits are narrowly tailored to target only speech that foreseeably produces real, imminent harm\u2014such as incitement, credible threats, or persistent targeted harassment\u2014while noncriminal hateful rhetoric is countered through education, community norms, and restorative practices. Applying objective standards, transparency, and due process helps protect vulnerable people without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open debate requires guarding against both censorship and harm: maintain broad protections for expression but draw precise, evidence\u2011based lines against speech that intentionally and imminently endangers others, including direct threats and coordinated harassment. Enforcement should be transparent, proportionate, and paired with counterspeech, media literacy, and restorative measures to heal harms and strengthen civic trust.",
    "Free expression should be robust enough to allow dissent and creativity, yet constrained narrowly where speech is intended and likely to produce imminent violence, credible threats, or systematic harassment; such constraints must be clearly defined, legally sound, and subject to due process. Beyond enforcement, society should prioritize education, counter\u2011speech, and restorative approaches to address prejudice while preserving a lively marketplace of ideas.",
    "Free expression is vital to democratic life, but it should not shield direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that cause real harm. Limits must be narrowly defined, enforced with transparent standards and due process, and complemented by education, restorative practices, and robust counter-speech to protect safety without unduly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open debate and the dignity of vulnerable people are both essential: laws and platform rules should prohibit imminent calls to violence, true threats, and coordinated harassment while preserving space for offensive but nonviolent views. Enforcement should be precise and evidence-based, paired with media literacy, community-led restorative remedies, and vigorous counterspeech to promote accountability and healing.",
    "Free speech should be broadly defended as the engine of inquiry and dissent, yet society must draw narrow, clear lines against speech intended and likely to produce imminent harm\u2014such as explicit calls for violence, specific threats, and organized campaigns to silence individuals. Complementing narrowly tailored legal limits with transparent moderation, restorative responses, and civic education balances liberty and safety while encouraging constructive dialogue.",
    "A practical compromise defends robust expression while recognizing that words can inflict tangible harm; policy should target only direct incitement, credible threats, and persistent targeted abuse with clearly defined rules and due process. Investing in counterspeech, prevention through education, and community-based restorative approaches reduces reliance on suppression and helps repair harms without stifling legitimate discourse.",
    "Society should protect broad latitude for speech that advances debate, art, and dissent, while preventing expressions that demonstrably endanger others\u2014imminent incitement, true threats, and coordinated harassment\u2014through precise legal standards and transparent enforcement. Pairing such limits with education, community remedies, and vigorous counter-speech helps safeguard both public safety and the free exchange of ideas.",

Those limits should be enforced with clear standards, due process, and complemented by education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter\u2011speech to preserve open debate while protecting vulnerable people.",
    "Protecting robust debate and creativity requires broad free\u2011speech protections alongside narrowly tailored prohibitions on true threats, imminent calls to violence, and organized harassment that foreseeably cause harm. Transparent enforcement by public institutions and platforms, coupled with education, community norms, and restorative remedies, can reduce harm without unduly chilling legitimate expression.",
    "Free speech must be defended to sustain dissent and cultural expression, but narrowly defined constraints on speech that intentionally and imminently endangers others are defensible. Pairing precise legal standards with due process, transparent moderation, and investments in counter\u2011speech and civic education balances liberty with the duty to safeguard dignity and safety.",
    "A balanced approach holds that speech should be free enough to test ideas and expose injustice, yet not serve as a license to threaten, incite violence, or engage in targeted campaigns that silence people. Limiting only conduct\u2011oriented harms\u2014with objective criteria, predictable procedures, and restorative or educational responses\u2014aligns protection for vulnerable communities with the preservation of robust public discourse.",
    "Democratic life depends on open expression, but society should draw narrow, well\u2011defined lines around direct incitement, credible threats, and coordinated harassment that produce tangible harm. Enforcing those lines transparently, respecting due process, and leaning on education, counter\u2011speech, and community accountability creates common ground between protecting liberty and preventing real\u2011world damage.",
    "Free expression is indispensable to democracy and social progress, but narrowly defined limits are justified where speech intentionally and imminently incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or enables sustained targeted harassment. Clear legal standards, due process, and transparent platform policies should guide enforcement while education, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech address offensive but noncriminal views to protect safety without unduly chilling debate.",
    "A healthy public sphere protects vigorous, even uncomfortable debate while drawing narrow, well\u2011defined lines against direct incitement to violence, true threats, and coordinated harassment that cause tangible harm. Enforcement should be transparent and proportionate, and must be paired with education, community norms, and counterspeech to uphold dignity and preserve open inquiry.",
    "Protecting free speech and protecting people from harm are complementary goals: free expression should be broadly safeguarded, but not as a shield for speech that clearly and directly threatens others or organizes imminent violence. Combining narrowly tailored legal limits, due process, and non\u2011censorial remedies\u2014such as education, restorative justice, and active counterspeech\u2014helps maintain both safety and a vibrant marketplace of ideas.",
    "Societies should safeguard robust expression while preventing speech that foreseeably produces imminent violence, credible threats, or targeted, sustained harassment. Defining harm precisely, enforcing narrow rules transparently, and investing in education, restorative responses, and counterspeech offers a balanced approach that respects liberty and protects vulnerable people.",
    "Free speech is essential but not absolute: when words are intended and likely to produce immediate violence, true threats, or systematic harassment, narrow prohibitions are appropriate. Transparent standards, fair procedures, and emphasis on education, community accountability, and vigorous counter\u2011speech ensure protection for vulnerable people without needlessly silencing dissent.",
    "Free speech is vital to democratic life and must be protected, but it does not shield direct calls for violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that produce real harm.

    "Free expression is indispensable to democratic life and open inquiry, yet it should not protect direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or targeted, sustained harassment that foreseeably causes harm. Limits must be narrowly defined, applied with clear standards and due process, while society prioritizes education, restorative measures, and vigorous counter-speech to address offensive but non\u2011violent views.",
    "Safeguarding free speech and protecting vulnerable people can coexist when legal and platform rules are tightly focused on imminent harm\u2014true threats, calls to violence, and coordinated harassment\u2014rather than on unpopular or offensive ideas. Transparent enforcement, precise definitions, and investments in education, counterspeech, and community-based remedies reduce harm without needlessly chilling debate.",
    "A balanced approach defends robust, even uncomfortable debate while prohibiting speech that intentionally and plausibly leads to violence or sustained dehumanization of identifiable individuals or groups. Narrow, evidence\u2011based restrictions paired with due process, transparent moderation, and restorative education create predictable protections for safety and dignity without broad censorship.",

    "Protecting expression and protecting people are mutually reinforcing when prohibitions are confined to tangible harms\u2014imminent violence, specific threats, and coordinated harassment\u2014and when remedies emphasize due process, transparency, and rehabilitation. Public institutions and platforms should favor precise rules, accountability, and civic education to deter harm while preserving a vibrant marketplace of ideas.",

This approach protects both liberty and the dignity of vulnerable communities.",
    "Free expression is essential to democratic life and creative inquiry, but it should not shield direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that causes real harm. Reasonable, narrowly tailored limits\u2014clearly defined, transparently enforced, and subject to due process\u2014can protect safety and dignity without silencing legitimate debate. Alongside legal standards, education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech should be prioritized to address hateful ideas and heal harms while preserving an open marketplace of ideas.",
    "Protecting free speech is vital, yet words that intentionally and imminently call for violence, make credible threats, or coordinate targeted abuse ought to be restricted by precise, narrowly drawn rules. Enforcement should focus on demonstrable harm and intent, include clear procedures and due process, and be paired with non\u2011censorial responses\u2014education, counterspeech, and restorative accountability\u2014to reduce harm without chilling robust public discourse. This balanced approach seeks both safety for vulnerable people and space for dissenting, even uncomfortable, viewpoints.",
    "Free speech should remain broad enough to sustain dissent, art, and inquiry, but it must yield to narrow limits where speech foreseeably produces imminent violence, credible threats, or systematic harassment. Clear legal standards, transparent platform policies, and fair enforcement mechanisms should target conduct not ideas, while society invests in education, community dialogue, and counterspeech to confront prejudice and repair harm. Centering both liberty and dignity allows open debate to coexist with protections for vulnerable members of the community.",
    "Open debate and the protection of human dignity are compatible goals when limits on speech are narrowly and objectively defined to prohibit incitement, true threats, and coordinated harassment that produce tangible harm. Any restriction should be accompanied by due process, proportional remedies, and non\u2011governmental tools\u2014education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech\u2014to address underlying attitudes without resorting to broad censorship. This synthesis preserves free expression while prioritizing public safety and equal participation.",
    "Freedom of expression must be upheld, but it need not extend to speech that intentionally incites imminent violence, issues credible threats, or engages in persistent targeted dehumanization. Narrow, evidence\u2011based limits with transparent enforcement and procedural safeguards, together with robust counter\u2011speech, education, and restorative responses, offer a principled way to protect vulnerable people while maintaining a vibrant public sphere. Emphasizing context, intent, and proportionality helps reconcile concerns about censorship with the duty to prevent real harm."
