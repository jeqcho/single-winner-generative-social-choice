    "Free speech should be broadly protected to sustain open debate and individual liberty, while narrowly limiting only speech that intentionally and imminently causes harm\u2014such as direct threats, clear incitement to violence, or sustained targeted harassment. Those limits must be precisely defined, enforced transparently with due process, and complemented by education, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech to address prejudice and repair harm without chilling legitimate dissent.",
    "Protecting free expression and protecting people from real-world harm are complementary goals: uphold wide latitude for controversial or offensive ideas, but draw clear, narrowly tailored lines against true threats, imminent incitement, and coordinated harassment that endangers safety. Combine legal clarity and due process with community norms, platform accountability, education, and counter-speech to preserve democratic dialogue while safeguarding vulnerable individuals.",
    "Free speech is vital for democracy and learning, yet it should not be a shield for conduct that creates a clear, immediate risk of harm\u2014such as calls for violence, credible threats, or persistent targeted abuse. Limitations should be narrow, evidence-based, and applied with transparent enforcement and remedies that favor restorative responses, education, and vigorous counterspeech over broad censorship.",
    "Society should defend wide-ranging expression while imposing narrowly defined restrictions only when speech intentionally produces imminent physical harm, constitutes true threats, or systematically silences people through coordinated harassment. Clear legal standards, consistent enforcement, and investments in education, community dialogue, and counterspeech create a balanced approach that protects both liberty and dignity.",
    "Maintaining a free marketplace of ideas requires that hateful or offensive views be countered, not simply suppressed, except where speech crosses into direct, imminent violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that deprives people of safety and equal participation. Policies should therefore be precise, transparent, and paired with due process, restorative practices, and civic education to address harm while preserving robust debate.",
    "Free expression is vital to democracy and personal autonomy, but it should not be a shield for speech that directly and imminently threatens safety; narrowly defined prohibitions on true threats, incitement to violence, and sustained targeted harassment protect people without silencing robust debate. Clear, objective standards enforced with due process, combined with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter\u2011speech, best balance liberty and dignity while minimizing overbroad censorship.",
    "Society should broadly safeguard open debate while drawing narrow, precise boundaries against speech that intentionally incites imminent lawless action, issues credible threats, or coordinates sustained harassment that silences or endangers others. Complementing these legal limits with transparent enforcement, appeals, platform accountability, and investment in education and counterspeech preserves free inquiry and protects vulnerable communities.",
    "Free speech must be robust enough to allow unpopular ideas yet constrained where words foreseeably produce real harm; narrowly tailored rules against direct incitement, true threats, and targeted harassment\u2014applied neutrally and with due process\u2014can prevent violence without chilling legitimate expression. Emphasizing restorative remedies, public education, and counter\u2011speech helps address prejudice and repair community trust.",
    "Protecting open, even uncomfortable, discourse is essential, but limits are justified when speech poses a clear, imminent danger to others through calls for violence, credible threats, or organized harassment. To bridge concerns about censorship and safety, adopt precise legal thresholds, transparent enforcement, and community\u2011based responses\u2014education, counterspeech, and restorative measures\u2014that reduce harm while preserving democratic debate.",
    "Free expression should be the default in a democratic society, yet narrowly defined restrictions on direct incitement, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment are necessary to safeguard safety and dignity. Applying those limits with clear definitions, fair procedures, and a preference for educational and restorative responses where possible keeps public conversation open while protecting vulnerable people from real harm.",
    "Free speech is essential to democratic life and the free exchange of ideas, but it should not be a shield for direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that endangers people. Any limits should be narrowly and clearly defined, enforced with due process, and coupled with education, robust counter-speech, and restorative remedies so that safety and dignity are protected without needlessly silencing legitimate debate.",
    "Preserving broad freedom of expression is vital, yet narrowly tailored restrictions are justified where speech intentionally and imminently causes harm\u2014such as true threats, calls for violence, or coordinated harassment. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement, and investment in education, platform accountability, and community-based restorative practices can protect vulnerable people while keeping space for robust, even uncomfortable, public discussion.",
    "Free speech should remain robust to support dissent, art, and inquiry, but it does not extend to speech that directly incites violence, issues credible threats, or systematically silences people through targeted harassment. Limits must be precise, narrowly focused on imminent harm, and accompanied by due process, counter-speech, and educational or restorative responses that address underlying harms without creating overbroad censorship.",
    "Valuing both liberty and human dignity means protecting wide-ranging expression while drawing narrow, well-defined lines against speech that foreseeably produces immediate harm\u2014true threats, incitement, and coordinated harassment. Complementing legal thresholds with transparent platform rules, community norms, education, and restorative accountability helps uphold safety and equal participation without suppressing legitimate debate.",
    "Free expression is a cornerstone of a healthy society, but it should not permit direct calls to violence, credible threats, or persistent targeted abuse that strip people of safety and participation. Limits should therefore be narrowly tailored, evidence-based, and applied with fairness and due process, alongside strong emphasis on counterspeech, education, and restorative practices to repair harm and sustain open civic discourse.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected to preserve open debate and individual liberty, while narrowly restricting only speech that directly and imminently incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment that deprives people of safety and equal participation. Clear legal definitions, fair enforcement with due process, and complementary measures like education, counterspeech, restorative practices, and transparent platform policies can protect vulnerable people without needlessly silencing legitimate dissent.",
    "Robust free expression is essential to democratic life, but society can agree to narrowly tailored limits on speech that poses a real, immediate danger\u2014such as true threats, calls for imminent violence, or coordinated harassment\u2014while preserving space for controversial yet nonviolent ideas. Combining precise laws and due process with community-led responses, education, and accountable platform moderation balances protection of dignity and safety with defense of open discourse.",
    "Protecting open debate and protecting people from harm are compatible goals: free speech should be the default, but narrowly defined prohibitions on incitement, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment are justified to prevent imminent harm. Transparent, evidence-based standards, consistent enforcement, and investment in counterspeech, restorative remedies, and education help prevent abuse without chilling legitimate expression.",
    "Freedom of expression should be defended while recognizing limits where words directly produce or threaten real-world harm\u2014specifically true threats, calls for immediate violence, and systematic harassment of identifiable individuals or groups. Narrow, well\u2011specified rules enforced with due process, paired with education, community norms, and restorative practices, offer a principled way to safeguard both liberty and the dignity of vulnerable people.",
    "We can uphold broad free speech while agreeing that narrowly targeted restrictions are appropriate for speech that imminently incites violence, issues credible threats, or coordinates sustained harassment that silences others; outside those boundaries, remedies should favor counterspeech, education, and restorative accountability. Clear definitions, transparent enforcement, and protections for debate and dissent create common ground between safeguarding liberty and preventing real harm.",
    "Free speech is vital to democratic life and the search for truth, but it should not provide cover for speech that directly and imminently threatens or organizes violence, or that targets individuals with sustained harassment that deprives them of safety and equal participation. Limits should therefore be narrowly defined by intent and likelihood of imminent harm, enforced transparently with due process, and complemented by education, restorative practices, and robust counter-speech to address prejudice without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open, even unpopular, expression is essential, yet society also has a duty to prevent real-world harm: narrowly restrict true threats, direct incitement to imminent lawless action, and coordinated targeted harassment while preserving vigorous political, artistic, and academic speech. Clear legal standards, impartial enforcement, platform transparency, and investment in counterspeech and community education create practical safeguards that respect liberty and protect vulnerable people.",
    "Free expression should be broadly defended, but narrowly tailored boundaries are justified where speech intentionally and foreseeably causes imminent harm\u2014such as credible threats, calls for violence, or sustained targeted abuse. Emphasizing precise definitions, due process, and non\u2011legal remedies like education, restorative dialogue, and counter-speech helps protect dignity and safety without needlessly silencing robust public debate.",
    "Balancing liberty and safety means defending a wide range of speech while prohibiting conduct-based harms: true threats, incitement to immediate violence, and organized harassment that endangers people should be off-limits. Those limits must be narrowly drawn, applied transparently with appeals and safeguards, and reinforced by community norms, platform responsibility, and educational efforts to reduce harm and preserve open discourse.",
    "Free speech and human dignity can coexist when unlawful, high\u2011risk expressions\u2014direct threats, imminent incitement, and persistent targeted harassment\u2014are narrowly prohibited and addressed through fair, well\u2011defined procedures. Outside those narrow boundaries, priority should be given to counterspeech, education, and restorative approaches that challenge hateful ideas while protecting the space for vigorous, even uncomfortable, debate.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected as essential to democracy and open debate, while narrowly limiting expression that directly and imminently incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment. Such limits must be precisely defined, enforced with due process, and paired with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech to protect dignity without unduly chilling legitimate criticism.",
    "Protecting robust expression and protecting people from harm are both vital: restrict only clear, imminent harms\u2014true threats, coordinated calls for violence, and persistent targeted harassment\u2014while preserving space for controversial ideas. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement, and community-led education and restorative remedies help balance liberty with safety.",
    "Societies should defend open debate and the marketplace of ideas, but draw narrow, objective lines against speech that intentionally produces immediate physical harm or terrorizes identifiable individuals or groups. Complementary measures\u2014counter-speech, platform accountability, education, and fair appeals\u2014should address hateful but noncriminal expression without resorting to broad censorship.",
    "Free expression and human dignity can be reconciled by protecting nonviolent, even offensive, speech while prohibiting direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and targeted harassment that endangers people. Any restrictions should be narrowly tailored, context-sensitive, and accompanied by due process, transparent rules, and investment in restorative and educational responses.",
    "A principled approach upholds broad free speech yet permits narrowly defined limits on speech that poses an immediate risk of harm\u2014such as true threats, incitement to imminent lawless action, and organized harassment. Combining precise legal thresholds with transparent enforcement, proportional remedies, and community-based education and counterspeech preserves open discourse while safeguarding vulnerable people.",
    "Free expression is essential to democracy and individual liberty, yet it does not protect direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that endangers people. Limits should be narrow, clearly defined, and enforced with due process, while noncriminal hateful or offensive ideas are best addressed through education, counterspeech, and restorative remedies so robust debate is preserved without leaving vulnerable communities exposed.",
    "A healthy public sphere defends broad free speech while drawing narrowly tailored legal lines against imminent harm\u2014true threats, calls for violence, and coordinated harassment. Emphasis on precise definitions, fair enforcement, and investment in education, moderation, and counter-speech reconciles safety with open debate.",
    "Protecting free expression and protecting people from harm are both legitimate goals, so restrictions should be limited to speech that intentionally and imminently produces violence or constitutes targeted harassment. Outside those narrow boundaries, societies should rely on counterspeech, civic education, and restorative practices to address hateful ideas without resorting to broad censorship.",
    "Free speech should remain the norm to foster debate, art, and accountability, but narrowly defined prohibitions on incitement, true threats, and systematic harassment are necessary to safeguard vulnerable people. These rules must be applied transparently, with due process and clear criteria to avoid political misuse, and complemented by public education, platform moderation, and restorative dialogue to address harms while preserving open discourse.",
    "Preserving robust freedom of expression requires balancing liberty with responsibility: criminal limits should target only direct, imminent harms like credible threats and organized harassment. For other offensive or hateful speech, prioritize counterspeech, education, and community remedies to uphold dignity without stifling legitimate disagreement.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected as essential to democratic life and the exchange of ideas, while narrowly limited where expression directly and imminently incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment that deprives people of safety and equal participation. Clear, narrowly defined legal standards, fair enforcement with due process, and complementary responses like education, counterspeech, restorative practices, and transparent platform policies can protect dignity without unduly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open expression is vital, yet words that intentionally call for or foreseeably cause imminent harm\u2014true threats, direct incitement to violence, or organized harassment\u2014warrant narrow, well\u2011defined limits. Paired with transparent enforcement, due process, robust counterspeech, and educational or restorative remedies, these boundaries can safeguard vulnerable people while preserving vigorous public debate.",
    "Free speech and human dignity can be reconciled by defending broad protections for controversial but nonviolent ideas while drawing precise legal lines against direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and persistent targeted harassment. Combining narrowly tailored laws, impartial procedures, and community-led responses\u2014such as education, restorative justice, and responsible moderation\u2014helps prevent real harm without silencing legitimate disagreement.",
    "Open debate should be preserved as a cornerstone of civic life, but it need not tolerate speech that imminently endangers others through calls to violence, true threats, or coordinated harassment; such harms merit narrowly tailored legal limits. Transparent standards, consistent due process, and investment in counterspeech, education, and restorative measures offer a balanced path that protects both safety and free expression.",
    "Society benefits from robust free expression, yet narrowly targeted limits are justified for speech that intentionally and imminently incites violence, issues credible threats, or systematically silences people through harassment. Ensuring those limits are precisely defined, fairly enforced, and complemented by education, counter-speech, and restorative community practices preserves open discourse while protecting vulnerable individuals.",
    "Free speech is a cornerstone of democratic life and should be broadly protected, yet it is not absolute: narrowly tailored limits against true threats, imminent incitement to violence, and sustained targeted harassment are justified to protect safety and dignity. These boundaries should be defined clearly, enforced transparently with due process, and complemented by education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech to preserve robust debate while reducing harm.",
    "Upholding open expression and protecting people from real harm are both legitimate goals, so speech that intentionally and imminently endangers others\u2014such as direct threats, calls for violence, or coordinated harassment\u2014should be restricted under precise, narrowly tailored rules. Alongside those legal thresholds, communities, platforms, and institutions should invest in clear policies, transparent enforcement, and non\u2011punitive measures like education and restorative dialogue to safeguard participation in public life without needlessly chilling unpopular ideas.",
    "Free expression must be defended as vital to inquiry and pluralism, yet reasonable, narrowly drawn limits are appropriate where words foreseeably produce immediate physical harm or systematically silence vulnerable people through threats or organized abuse. Emphasizing clear definitions, impartial enforcement, and remedies such as counter-speech, education, and restorative accountability helps reconcile liberty with dignity and public safety.",
    "Protecting robust debate and protecting people from harm can be reconciled by reserving censorship only for narrow cases\u2014true threats, imminent incitement, and sustained targeted harassment\u2014while leaving offensive or unpopular viewpoints to be challenged openly. Transparent standards, due process, and investments in civic education, platform responsibility, and restorative practices create common-ground safeguards that reduce harm without silencing legitimate dissent.",
    "Free speech should remain wide enough to foster dissent, art, and critical inquiry, but society should draw clear, narrowly defined lines against speech that directly threatens safety or coordinates harassment that deprives people of equal participation. Combining precise legal limits with transparent enforcement, appeals processes, and non\u2011legal responses like counterspeech and restorative community measures strikes a practical balance between liberty and protection.",
    "A free society should protect robust, even unpopular, expression while drawing narrowly defined legal lines against speech that directly and imminently threatens safety\u2014including true threats, calls for violence, and coordinated targeted harassment. Those limits must be precise, transparently enforced with due process, and paired with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech so harms are addressed without unduly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Open debate and the exchange of ideas are essential, but speech that intentionally and imminently endangers others\u2014such as credible threats, incitement to violence, or sustained harassment\u2014should not be protected. Narrow, evidence\u2011based legal standards, fair enforcement, and community-led remedies like education and restorative accountability can protect dignity and safety while preserving broad freedom of expression.",
    "Safeguarding free expression requires a balance: defend wide latitude for dissenting and artistic speech while prohibiting narrowly circumscribed harms that foreseeably produce violence or silence people through targeted abuse. Clear definitions, transparent procedures, and non\u2011criminal responses\u2014education, counterspeech, and restorative measures\u2014help protect vulnerable communities without sacrificing open public discourse.",
    "Free speech should be the norm, but it is reasonable to restrict only narrowly specified conduct\u2014true threats, imminent incitement to lawless action, and coordinated targeted harassment\u2014that creates real danger. Such restrictions require precise legal thresholds, due process, and complementary social tools like media literacy, community standards, and restorative practices to address prejudice while minimizing censorship.",
    "Defend broad free expression as vital to democracy while recognizing that narrowly tailored limits on direct threats, calls for immediate violence, and persistent targeted harassment are necessary to protect safety and equal participation. Enforce those limits transparently and fairly, and emphasize education, counter\u2011speech, and restorative approaches to reduce harm without extinguishing legitimate, difficult, or unpopular ideas.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected to sustain democratic debate, creativity, and accountability, while narrowly limiting speech that directly and imminently incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment; such limits must be clearly defined and applied with due process. Complementary tools\u2014education, restorative practices, transparent platform policies, and vigorous counter\u2011speech\u2014can address hateful ideas without needlessly chilling legitimate expression.",
    "A balanced approach defends wide latitude for controversial and unpopular ideas but draws precise lines against true threats, calls for imminent violence, and coordinated harassment that endangers people. Enforcement should be transparent, evidence\u2011based, and subject to clear appeals, while community education and counterspeech work to challenge prejudice and repair harm.",
    "Protecting both liberty and dignity requires making free expression the default while confining legal restrictions to speech that poses a real, immediate risk of harm\u2014such as direct incitement, credible threats, or organized targeting of individuals. Platforms, institutions, and lawmakers should pair narrowly tailored rules with restorative responses and public education to keep discourse open and communities safe.",
    "Free speech is essential to civic life, but it should not be a shield for speech that predictably leads to violence, intimidation, or the sustained silencing of vulnerable people; narrow statutory and policy standards focused on intent and imminent harm, applied with clear procedures, protect both safety and open debate. Investing in media literacy, counterspeech, and restorative accountability addresses root causes of hateful expression rather than relying solely on censorship.",
    "Common ground holds that speech should generally remain free, yet direct incitement to lawless action, credible threats, and systemic targeted harassment that endanger people warrant restriction under narrowly tailored, transparent rules. Complementary measures\u2014education, community norms, and proportionate remedies\u2014can reduce harm while safeguarding robust public discourse.",
    "Free speech is vital to democracy and personal autonomy, but it is not absolute: narrowly tailored limits are warranted for true threats, imminent incitement to violence, and sustained targeted harassment that endanger people. Those limits should be clearly defined, applied with due process, and supplemented by education, restorative practices, and robust counter-speech to protect dignity without silencing legitimate debate.",

    "Free speech is fundamental to democratic life and the exchange of ideas, but it should not serve as a shield for speech that directly and imminently causes harm; narrowly tailored limits on true threats, clear incitement to violence, and sustained targeted harassment can protect safety and dignity while preserving robust debate. Policies and laws should be precise, consistently enforced with due process, and paired with education, restorative practices, and support for counterspeech so that disagreement is resolved through argument and community repair rather than silencing.",
    "Protecting open expression and protecting people from real-world harm are both legitimate goals, so limits should be narrowly focused on speech that intentionally and imminently incites violence, issues credible threats, or organizes sustained harassment. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement, and non-punitive responses\u2014like education, restorative dialogue, and robust counter-speech\u2014help maintain an open marketplace of ideas without leaving vulnerable communities exposed.",
    "Free expression should remain broad enough to allow dissent, art, and difficult debate, while narrowly defined prohibitions address speech that creates a clear and immediate risk of physical harm\u2014such as true threats, calls for imminent lawless action, or coordinated harassment of individuals. Complementing narrow legal limits with platform accountability, civic education, and restorative community measures balances liberty with safety and helps preserve mutual dignity in public life.",
    "Upholding free speech and protecting vulnerable people are compatible aims: speech that foreseeably and imminently produces violence or constitutes targeted, sustained threats should be restricted through precise, evidence-based rules, whereas offensive or unpopular ideas are best countered by counterspeech, education, and community norms. Ensuring clarity, proportionality, and due process in enforcement fosters public trust while preserving space for robust democratic debate.",
    "Democracy depends on vigorous free expression, but that freedom does not extend to direct calls for violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that silence or endanger people; narrowly tailored legal limits focused on intent and imminent harm should be paired with education, restorative remedies, and transparent moderation practices to protect dignity without undue censorship. This combined approach promotes accountability, preserves open discourse, and prioritizes the safety of vulnerable communities."
