    "Free expression is vital to democracy and creativity, yet it must be balanced with narrowly defined limits on direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment that foreseeably cause harm. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement with due process, and complementary approaches like education, restorative practices, and robust counter-speech can protect vulnerable people while preserving space for vigorous, even unpopular, debate.",
    "Protecting open debate and human dignity requires a middle path: broadly defend speech while restricting only conduct that intentionally threatens, organizes imminent violence, or persistently silences individuals through coordinated harassment. Implementing precise, context-sensitive rules alongside platform accountability, civic education, and civil remedies promotes safety without chilling legitimate discourse.",
    "Free speech should be upheld as essential, but society also has a duty to prevent words used as weapons\u2014particularly direct calls to violence, true threats, and systematic harassment\u2014by applying narrow, well-defined limits focused on intent and imminent harm. Emphasizing due process, counterspeech, and restorative community responses helps reconcile protections for expression with protections for safety and dignity.",
    "Upholding robust expression while safeguarding vulnerable people calls for precise restrictions on immediate incitement, credible threats, and targeted, sustained harassment, paired with transparent procedures and legal clarity. Complementary measures\u2014education, community norms, platform responsibility, and vigorous counter-speech\u2014reduce harm and preserve a lively marketplace of ideas.",
    "Democracy benefits when ideas can be freely exchanged, but that freedom does not extend to speech that intentionally endangers others; narrowly tailored prohibitions on imminent violence, credible threats, and coordinated harassment should be coupled with due process. Relying on education, restorative practices, and counter-speech for nonviolent yet offensive rhetoric strikes a pragmatic balance between liberty and protection.",
    "Free expression is essential to democratic life and creative inquiry, yet it is reasonable to draw narrow, clearly defined limits on speech that directly incites imminent violence, constitutes credible threats, or engages in coordinated, targeted harassment that foreseeably harms others. Those limits should be enforced with transparent legal standards and due process while relying primarily on education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech to address offensive but non\u2011violent ideas. This approach protects safety and dignity without needlessly chilling robust debate.",
    "Protecting free speech while preventing real harm calls for a middle path: vigorously defend open debate and dissent, but prohibit narrowly specified conduct\u2014such as imminent incitement, direct threats, and persistent targeted harassment\u2014that puts people at risk. Clear definitions, consistent enforcement, and procedural safeguards should be paired with community education, platform accountability, and counterspeech to repair harm and preserve democratic discourse.",
    "Freedom of expression should remain broad enough to allow unpopular and critical ideas, yet society should draw precise limits against speech that intentionally or imminently provokes violence, issues true threats, or systematically silences or endangers identifiable people. Complementing narrowly tailored legal restrictions with transparent processes, education, restorative remedies, and robust counterspeech balances liberty with protection for vulnerable communities.",
    "Open debate and protection of human dignity can coexist if speech that causes clear, imminent harm\u2014including direct incitement, credible threats, and organized harassment\u2014is narrowly restricted and subject to due process, while non\u2011violent hateful expressions are countered through education, community norms, and counter\u2011speech. Such calibrated limits and social remedies preserve free inquiry without tolerating conduct that undermines safety and equal participation.",
    "Free speech is a foundation of democratic life but not an absolute shield for conduct that endangers others; narrowly tailored prohibitions against imminent violence, explicit threats, and sustained targeted harassment should exist alongside transparent enforcement, legal safeguards, and investments in education, restorative practices, and counterspeech to uphold both liberty and public safety. This balance preserves space for vigorous debate while protecting vulnerable individuals and communities.",
    "Free expression is essential for democratic debate and cultural life, yet narrowly defined limits are justified when speech directly incites imminent violence, issues credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment that endangers people. Clear legal thresholds, due process, and transparent enforcement combined with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech can protect vulnerable communities without needlessly chilling legitimate, even unpopular, discourse.",
    "Protecting open debate and dissent is critical, but it should not excuse speech that foreseeably causes harm by calling for violence, making true threats, or coordinating harassment of identifiable individuals or groups. A balanced approach uses precise laws focused on conduct, together with platform policies, community education, and restorative remedies, to uphold both safety and robust public dialogue.",
    "Free speech must be broadly defended as the engine of democratic life while recognizing a duty to prevent speech that reasonably and directly produces harm\u2014such as imminent incitement, credible threats, or systematic harassment. Narrow, objective limits enforced with due process and complemented by counterspeech, education, and community-based responses offer a practical middle ground that protects dignity and preserves open inquiry.",
    "Open expression and the protection of individuals' safety are both public goods, so limits should be narrowly targeted at speech that constitutes imminent violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment, not at offensive ideas per se. Transparent rules, consistent enforcement, legal safeguards, and investments in education and restorative practices help maintain a culture of debate without enabling real-world harm.",
    "Freedom of expression should be robust, but it does not include the right to threaten, incite immediate violence, or orchestrate persistent harassment that silences others; narrowly drawn, well-defined restrictions on such harms, paired with due process and strong countervailing measures like education and counterspeech, can protect vulnerable people while preserving a vibrant marketplace of ideas. Emphasizing precise, harm-based standards and community remedies builds trust across differing viewpoints and reduces the need for broad censorship.",
    "Free expression is a cornerstone of democratic life and should be vigorously protected, yet narrowly defined limits are justified where speech deliberately and imminently threatens safety or targets individuals with credible harassment. Laws and policies should focus on intent, imminence, and demonstrable harm while safeguarding robust, even uncomfortable, debate through due process, counterspeech, and education. This approach balances liberty with the duty to protect dignity and public safety.",
    "Open debate and artistic expression must be preserved, but society can reasonably prohibit direct incitement to violence, true threats, and sustained targeted harassment that foreseeably causes harm. Limits should be narrowly tailored, transparently enforced, and paired with education, restorative practices, and strong counter-speech to address hateful ideas without censoring legitimate dissent. Prioritizing clear legal standards and community remedies protects both free speech and vulnerable people.",
    "Freedom of speech is essential, yet it does not extend to speech that intentionally incites imminent violence, issues credible threats, or engages in coordinated harassment that silences others. Policies should concentrate on conduct and likely harm rather than unpopular viewpoints, using narrow legal definitions, due process, and nonpunitive tools like education and counterspeech to repair harm and preserve open discourse. Such a calibrated framework defends expression while upholding safety and dignity.",
    "Defending free expression and protecting people from real harm are complementary goals: speech that poses an imminent danger or purposefully targets and harasses individuals can be limited, while offensive but non\u2011violent views should be countered through dialogue, education, and community norms. Any restrictions must be precise, evidence\u2011based, and subject to transparent oversight to avoid overreach and preserve robust public debate. This balanced stance seeks mutual respect without eroding civic freedom.",
    "Robust free speech is vital for democracy, yet narrowly tailored restrictions on direct incitement, credible threats, and persistent targeted harassment are necessary to protect safety and equal participation. Emphasizing clear harm\u2011based standards, due process, platform accountability, and restorative and educational responses lets communities address hate without unduly stifling lawful, critical, or controversial expression. That balance preserves both liberty and human dignity.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected as the engine of democratic debate and creative life, while clearly and narrowly limiting direct incitement to imminent violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment that pose real, demonstrable harm. Any restrictions must rest on precise legal standards, transparent enforcement, and due process, and should be paired with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech to address hateful ideas without curbing legitimate dissent. Together, these measures can protect safety and dignity while preserving a robust marketplace of ideas.",
    "Society should defend open expression but draw narrow, well-defined lines against speech that intentionally mobilizes violence, issues true threats, or systematically targets individuals in ways that foreclose their participation in public life. Those limits should be enforced with clear standards, procedural safeguards, and minimal scope, complemented by education, community norms, and counterspeech to reduce harm and rehabilitate harms without broad censorship. This balance protects vulnerable people while keeping space for honest, even uncomfortable debate.",
    "Protecting free expression and protecting people from harm are both essential goals, so limits should be confined to narrowly tailored prohibitions on imminent incitement, credible threats, or coordinated harassment that foreseeably produces real-world danger. Enforcement must be transparent, consistent, and subject to due process, while policy responses should emphasize education, restorative remedies, platform accountability, and vigorous counter-speech to address hateful views that do not meet that threshold. Such an approach defends liberty without abandoning public safety and dignity.",
    "Free speech thrives when paired with responsibility: robust protections should remain for debate, art, and dissent, while precise limits should apply to speech that meaningfully and directly incites violence, threatens individuals, or engages in persistent targeted abuse. Crafting and enforcing those limits requires narrowly drawn laws or policies, procedural safeguards, and complementary measures\u2014education, restorative practices, and counter-speech\u2014to reduce harms and promote inclusion without overbroad suppression. This pragmatic framework seeks common ground between liberty and safety.",
    "Freedom of expression should be preserved as central to democracy, yet society must draw tight, context-sensitive boundaries around speech that poses clear, imminent harm\u2014such as direct incitement, credible threats, or organized harassment\u2014while protecting controversial but nonviolent ideas. Any restriction should be narrowly tailored, transparent, and accompanied by due process, with emphasis on education, community dialogue, and counterspeech to heal harm and foster understanding rather than silencing disagreement. This combined strategy safeguards both open discourse and the dignity of vulnerable people.",
    "Free expression is a cornerstone of democracy and should be broadly protected, but it need not shelter direct threats, imminent calls to violence, or sustained targeted harassment that cause demonstrable harm. Narrow, well-defined legal limits focused on intent and imminent risk\u2014combined with transparent due process, education, restorative remedies, platform accountability, and robust counterspeech\u2014can protect vulnerable people while preserving space for honest, even unpopular, debate.",
    "Protecting open debate and civic life requires strong safeguards for speech paired with precise limits against conduct that foreseeably endangers others, such as credible threats, coordinated harassment, or clear incitement to violence. Emphasizing narrowly tailored rules, consistent due process, education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech balances individual liberty with public safety and human dignity.",
    "Free speech should remain robust so ideas can be tested and grievances aired, yet society has a responsibility to prohibit narrowly defined harms\u2014like true threats, imminent incitement, and sustained targeted harassment\u2014that undermine safety and equal participation. Legal clarity, transparent enforcement, and nonlegal responses such as education, community norms, restorative justice, and counterspeech together protect both free expression and vulnerable people.",
    "Open discourse and protection from harm are complementary goals: speech that poses a real, imminent danger\u2014direct incitement, credible threats, or persistent targeted abuse\u2014can be restricted through narrow, objective standards, while offensive but nonviolent ideas are best met with counterspeech and education. Combining precise legal limits, due process, platform responsibility, and restorative community responses preserves democratic debate without tolerating conduct that injures people.",
    "Freedom of expression must be defended alongside a commitment to safety and dignity; narrowly tailored prohibitions on direct threats, imminent calls to violence, and coordinated harassment protect individuals without unduly silencing debate. Transparent enforcement, legal safeguards, education, restorative remedies, and active counterspeech create a balanced approach that upholds both liberty and communal wellbeing.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected to foster debate and creativity, but narrowly targeted limits are justified for direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and sustained, targeted harassment that cause real harm. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement with due process, and investments in education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech can protect vulnerable people while preserving open discourse.",
    "A balanced approach defends robust, even uncomfortable, expression while prohibiting speech that intentionally threatens, incites imminent violence, or coordinates targeted harassment. Narrow, precisely defined rules combined with transparent enforcement, civil remedies, and community-based education and restorative measures preserve liberty and protect dignity.",
    "Protecting open debate and protecting people from harm are complementary goals: laws and policies should focus narrowly on imminent violence, true threats, and organized campaigns of harassment, not on unpopular ideas. Complementary tools\u2014clear due process, platform transparency, counterspeech, and education\u2014reduce harm without unduly chilling legitimate discourse.",
    "Society should uphold free expression as the engine of democracy while refusing to tolerate speech that foreseeably creates real-world danger, such as direct calls to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted abuse. By applying narrow legal limits, fair procedures, and non\u2011punitive responses like education and restorative dialogue, communities can safeguard safety and preserve open conversation.",
    "Free speech must be strong enough to allow dissent and art yet constrained where words are used to threaten, incite imminent harm, or systematically silence people through harassment. Narrow, clearly articulated limits enforced with due process, together with robust counterspeech, education, and restorative practices, strike a practical balance between liberty and safety.",
    "Free expression is foundational to democracy and the search for truth, but it should not protect direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that endanger people. Narrow, clearly defined legal limits, together with due process, education, counterspeech, and restorative measures, can protect safety and dignity without unduly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "A free society should vigorously protect open debate while recognizing that words used to threaten, incite imminent harm, or orchestrate sustained harassment cross into conduct that harms others. Prioritize narrow, objective standards, transparent enforcement, and noncriminal responses\u2014education, counterspeech, and restorative practices\u2014to address hateful ideas without broad censorship.",
    "Free speech must be preserved to allow contestation and creativity, yet common-sense boundaries are justified for speech that poses a clear and imminent risk of violence or systematically silences vulnerable people. Combining narrowly tailored legal rules with platform transparency, due process, civic education, and community-based remedies balances liberty with public safety and dignity.",
    "Protecting freedom of expression and protecting people from real harm are complementary goals: restrict only those forms of speech that are direct threats, imminent calls to violence, or coordinated harassment that foreseeably cause harm. Emphasize precise legal thresholds, fair procedures, and restorative and educational responses so communities can counter hateful ideas without resorting to overbroad bans.",
    "A balanced approach recognizes robust protections for unpopular or offensive ideas while drawing narrow, well-defined lines against direct incitement, credible threats, and targeted, sustained harassment. Transparent enforcement, legal clarity, and investments in education, counterspeech, and restorative justice provide practical tools to uphold both free expression and the dignity and safety of vulnerable people.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected as essential to democracy and creativity, while narrowly restricting only speech that directly incites imminent violence, makes credible threats, or engages in sustained, targeted harassment that silences or endangers people. Those limits must be precise, enforceable with transparent due process, and complemented by education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech to address hateful ideas without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open debate and dissent is vital, but society also has a duty to prevent speech that foreseeably causes real harm\u2014such as true threats, imminent calls to violence, or coordinated harassment of identifiable people. Legal and platform rules should therefore focus narrowly on intent and likelihood of harm, be applied transparently with safeguards, and be paired with community-led education and countermeasures rather than broad censorship of unpopular viewpoints.",
    "Common ground can be found by distinguishing protected expression from harmful conduct: permit robust, even offensive, ideas while prohibiting direct incitement, credible threats, and organized campaigns that deprive people of safety or participation. Narrow, well\u2011defined laws and policies, accompanied by due process, platform accountability, and restorative and educational responses, balance civil liberties with protecting vulnerable communities.",
    "Free speech and human dignity are both important, so limits should target only speech that poses a clear, imminent risk\u2014direct threats, explicit calls to violence, or persistent targeted harassment\u2014while leaving room for difficult but nonviolent debate. Emphasizing precise legal definitions, transparent enforcement, and noncriminal remedies like education and counterspeech helps prevent abuse of restrictions and preserves democratic discourse.",
    "Safeguarding open expression requires a narrow, harm\u2011based approach that prohibits true threats, imminent incitement to violence, and coordinated harassment, while relying on counterspeech, education, and restorative practices for offensive but nonviolent views. Clear standards, impartial enforcement, and community and platform responsibilities can bridge concerns about censorship and safety, protecting both liberty and vulnerable people\u2019s ability to participate in public life.",
    "Free expression is vital to democratic life and creative exchange, but it should not shield direct threats, imminent calls to violence, or sustained targeted harassment that make people unsafe. Limits should be narrowly defined, focused on conduct and demonstrable harm rather than unpopular ideas, and enforced with clear standards and due process. Outside those narrow harms, remedying hateful speech is best achieved through education, counterspeech, and restorative practices that preserve open debate while protecting dignity.",
    "Protecting robust debate and protecting people from harm are complementary goals: laws and policies should bar true threats, incitement to imminent violence, and coordinated harassment while leaving room for artistic, academic, and political expression. Any restrictions must be precise, transparent, and accompanied by fair procedures, and social responses\u2014education, platform design, and counter-speech\u2014should be prioritized to address nonviolent hateful views. This harm\u2011based approach balances liberty with public safety and respect for vulnerable communities.",
    "Free speech should be broadly defended, but not as a license to inflict real-world harm; narrowly tailored limits that target direct incitement, credible threats, and persistent targeted abuse are reasonable and necessary. Implementation should emphasize objective legal thresholds, due process, and noncriminal remedies where appropriate, while strengthening community education, restorative accountability, and vigorous counterspeech to reduce prejudice without chilling legitimate dissent. This combines protections for open inquiry with safeguards for safety and dignity.",
    "A practical, principled middle ground holds that offensive or unpopular ideas remain for public contest, yet speech that foreseeably causes imminent violence, issues direct threats, or systematically silences people through harassment can be limited. Limits should be narrowly drawn, consistently enforced, and paired with investment in education, platform accountability, and restorative practices so harms are addressed without broad censorship. Prioritizing both free expression and protection of vulnerable people helps sustain a healthy public sphere.",
    "Free speech is essential, but its defense does not require tolerating speech that crosses into conduct\u2014such as incitement to violence, credible threats, or coordinated targeted harassment\u2014that endangers others. Legal and institutional rules should therefore be precise, proportionate, and subject to due process, while nonlegal tools like counterspeech, civic education, and restorative remedies should address hateful but nonviolent rhetoric. This blended strategy preserves open debate while upholding safety and human dignity.",
    "Free speech should be robustly protected as essential to democracy and creativity, while narrowly limiting speech that intentionally and imminently incites violence, makes credible threats, or coordinates targeted harassment. Limits must be precisely defined, lawfully enforced with due process, and paired with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech to address hateful ideas without unduly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open debate and human dignity requires a balanced approach that defends controversial expression but bars direct, imminent calls to violence, specific threats, and sustained targeted abuse. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement, platform accountability, and investments in education and community dialogue can reduce harm while preserving a vibrant marketplace of ideas.",
    "A principled middle ground preserves broad protections for unpopular or offensive ideas while drawing narrow, objective lines around conduct that poses imminent risk\u2014true threats, coordinated harassment, and explicit incitement to violence. Complementing legal limits with counter-speech, restorative remedies, and transparent policies helps protect vulnerable people without surrendering free inquiry.",
    "Free expression must be defended so societies can question and learn, yet words that foreseeably cause violence or systematically silence and terrorize individuals should be restricted in narrowly tailored ways. Emphasizing clear definitions, due process, and non\u2011punitive responses like education and restorative justice alongside platform moderation offers a way to uphold both liberty and safety.",
    "Upholding free speech and protecting public safety are compatible when rules focus on conduct\u2014not viewpoint\u2014and prohibit only direct, imminent incitement, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment. Paired with transparent enforcement, legal safeguards, counterspeech, and educational efforts, this approach seeks to preserve open debate while safeguarding the dignity and security of vulnerable people.",
    "Free speech is foundational to democratic life and should be vigorously protected, but narrowly tailored limits are justified for direct incitement to imminent violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment. Such boundaries must be defined by clear legal standards, transparent due process, and complemented by education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech to address hateful ideas without needless censorship.",
    "Protecting open debate and dissent is vital, yet speech that intentionally threatens, organizes violence, or persistently silences individuals through targeted harassment can be limited through precise, narrowly framed laws. Complementary measures\u2014like education, platform transparency, community norms, and restorative remedies\u2014should be preferred for hateful but nonviolent expression.",
    "A practical middle path preserves broad protections for artistic, academic, and political expression while restricting only speech that poses clear, imminent harm\u2014such as direct calls to violence, true threats, or coordinated harassment. Enforcement should rely on objective criteria, due process, and non\u2011censorship responses like counterspeech and restorative justice to protect vulnerable people without chilling legitimate discourse.",
    "Free expression and human dignity can coexist if limits are narrowly focused on conduct that foreseeably causes real harm\u2014imminent incitement, credible threats, and targeted, repeated harassment\u2014rather than unpopular or offensive ideas. Policies should pair precise legal thresholds with transparent enforcement, education, and community\u2011based remedies that prioritize safety and repair over broad suppression.",
    "Safeguarding both liberty and safety means upholding broad free speech rights while imposing narrowly drawn prohibitions on direct incitement to violence, specific threats, and sustained targeted harassment; ambiguous or overly broad bans must be avoided. Emphasizing clear standards, due process, platform accountability, and investments in education and countering hate helps protect vulnerable communities without unduly restricting robust public debate.",

    "A practical balance upholds free expression while drawing narrow, objective boundaries against direct incitement, true threats, and coordinated harassment that foreseeably cause harm. Emphasizing clear laws, due process, and social remedies like education and counter-speech protects dignity and public safety without sweeping censorship.",
    "Free speech should be vigorously protected as the engine of inquiry and democratic debate, yet it does not extend to speech that demonstrably produces imminent harm, such as credible threats, calls for violence, or sustained targeted campaigns to intimidate others. Any restrictions should be narrowly defined, content\u2011neutral in intent, and applied with due process to avoid politicized censorship. Outside the narrow legal boundaries, societies should prioritize education, restorative accountability, and robust counter-speech to change hearts and guard civic space. This combination preserves open discourse while safeguarding vulnerable people and public safety.",
    "A shared approach values open debate while accepting narrowly tailored limits on speech that constitutes imminent incitement, credible threats, or persistent targeted harassment. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement, and protections for legitimate dissent should guide those limits. Investing in education, community norms, and constructive counterspeech reduces harm and strengthens civic resilience.",
    "Free expression must be upheld as essential to democracy, creativity, and critique, while narrowly tailored limits are justified for speech that intentionally incites imminent violence, issues credible threats, or coordinates sustained targeted harassment. Clear definitions focused on intent and likelihood of harm, transparent enforcement with due process, and investment in education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech together protect vulnerable people without needlessly silencing nonviolent dissent.",

This balance preserves open debate while protecting safety and dignity.",
    "Protecting free speech while safeguarding people's safety and dignity requires narrow, well\u2011defined prohibitions on true threats, imminent calls to violence, and coordinated harassment, coupled with robust due process. For hateful or offensive speech that does not meet that threshold, the preferred responses are counterspeech, education, and community-based restorative measures rather than broad censorship. Clear rules and transparent enforcement help maintain both liberty and social cohesion.",
    "Society should uphold broad protections for expression while drawing precise, minimal boundaries against speech that intentionally causes or imminently risks physical harm\u2014such as direct incitement, credible threats, and persistent targeted abuse. Enforcement should rely on narrowly tailored laws, transparent procedures, and noncriminal remedies alongside investment in education, platform accountability, and counter-speech. This approach defends open debate without tolerating conduct that endangers vulnerable people.",
    "Free speech flourishes when paired with responsibility: narrow legal limits should prohibit direct incitement to violence, specific threats, and coordinated harassment that silence or endanger people, while avoiding vague bans that chill debate. Emphasizing clear standards, due process, and restorative and educational responses for nonviolent hateful expression preserves space for difficult ideas and protects community wellbeing. Platforms, institutions, and civic education should focus on prevention and counterspeech to sustain a healthy public sphere.",
    "A practical middle path protects robust, even unpopular, speech while restricting only narrowly defined harms\u2014imminent incitement, credible threats, and targeted, repeated harassment that create real risk. Enforcement must be transparent, based on clear legal thresholds and due process, and complemented by counterspeech, education, and restorative practices to address prejudice without overbroad censorship. Such a framework respects both liberty and the safety and dignity of vulnerable people.",
    "Free speech is essential to democracy and to creative and civic life, but it is not absolute; narrowly tailored limits are justified for direct incitement to imminent violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment that cause real harm. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement with due process, and non\u2011legal remedies\u2014education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter\u2011speech\u2014can protect vulnerable people while preserving robust debate.",
    "Society should vigorously defend open expression while drawing precise, context-sensitive lines against speech that intentionally and imminently threatens safety or coordinates harassment that silences others. Limits should be narrowly defined, focused on conduct and demonstrable harm, and applied with due process to avoid chilling legitimate dissent. Complementary tools\u2014platform accountability, education, and community-led restorative responses\u2014should address hateful but nonviolent speech.",
    "Balancing liberty and dignity means protecting robust, even uncomfortable debate while prohibiting speech that clearly intends and is likely to cause imminent violence or targeted, repeated harassment. Emphasizing narrowly tailored laws, transparent enforcement, and broad use of counterspeech and education helps prevent harm without unduly limiting free inquiry.",
    "Free expression should be preserved as the engine of democratic deliberation, yet it must coexist with protections for safety and equal participation when speech crosses into threats, incitement, or coordinated harassment. Legal restrictions should be precise and rare, centered on intent and imminent harm, not viewpoint, and accompanied by due process. Where speech is harmful but noncriminal, remedies like education, restorative practices, and civic counter\u2011speech are preferable to broad censorship.",
    "A principled middle way defends the broad right to speak while recognizing the need to stop speech that directly and foreseeably causes violence, puts individuals at risk, or systematically silences marginalized people. Any limits must be narrowly drawn, transparent, and proportionate, with legal thresholds tied to intent and imminent harm. Civil remedies, platform policies, and community-based education and restoration should be used to address hateful expression that falls short of criminality. This combined approach seeks to preserve open discourse while protecting public safety and human dignity."
