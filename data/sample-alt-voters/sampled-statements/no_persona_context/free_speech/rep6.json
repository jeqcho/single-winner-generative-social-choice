    "Free expression is vital to inquiry and democratic life, but it must coexist with protections that prevent direct threats, imminent calls to violence, and sustained targeted harassment; narrow, clearly defined limits focused on conduct and imminent harm can preserve robust debate while protecting safety and dignity. Where legal limits apply, they should be enforced with transparent standards and due process, while nonlegal responses\u2014education, counterspeech, restorative practices, and responsible platform policies\u2014address hateful but nonviolent speech and repair harm.",
    "Protecting the freedom to speak and to contest ideas should go hand in hand with narrowly tailored rules against true threats, incitement to imminent harm, and coordinated harassment that silences or endangers people; precise legal standards and fair enforcement prevent misuse while preserving unpopular but nonviolent expression. Complementary measures\u2014education, community dialogue, restorative remedies, and strong counterspeech\u2014are essential to heal harms and strengthen civic norms without resorting to broad censorship.",
    "Free speech must be robust enough to allow dissent and discovery, yet limited where words are used as a weapon to threaten, incite violence, or systematically harass individuals; those limits should be narrow, evidence\u2011based, and subject to due process to avoid chilling legitimate discourse. Emphasizing counterspeech, education, community standards, and restorative approaches helps address hateful attitudes while maintaining an open public square.",
    "A healthy public sphere protects broad expressive freedom while drawing narrow, clearly articulated lines against speech that poses a real, imminent danger\u2014such as direct threats, calls for violence, or organized campaigns of harassment\u2014and ensures enforcement is transparent and accountable. Outside those narrow legal boundaries, social remedies like education, platform moderation, restorative justice, and vigorous counterspeech are the proper tools to confront harmful ideas without unnecessary suppression of debate.",
    "Balancing liberty and dignity means defending free expression but restricting only the specific harms of incitement to violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment; these restrictions should be narrowly defined, proportionate, and applied with procedural safeguards. Simultaneously investing in education, community engagement, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech preserves open debate while protecting vulnerable people and promoting mutual respect.",
    "Free expression should remain broad to sustain democratic debate and creativity, while narrowly targeted limits are appropriate for direct threats, imminent incitement to violence, and sustained, targeted harassment that endangers people. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement, and due process\u2014paired with education, counterspeech, and restorative community responses\u2014can protect safety and dignity without needlessly silencing unpopular ideas.",
    "Protecting free speech and protecting people are complementary goals: preserve open, even uncomfortable dialogue, but prohibit speech that intentionally and foreseeably causes imminent physical harm or systematically silences others through coordinated abuse. Prioritize precise rules focused on conduct and harm, transparent moderation, and noncoercive remedies like education and community accountability to balance liberty with safety.",
    "A balanced approach defends robust expression while drawing narrow, well-defined lines against true threats, calls for immediate violence, and targeted harassment that deprives people of safety and equal participation. Emphasize evidence-based thresholds, procedural safeguards, and restorative measures alongside counterspeech and civic education to reduce harm without broad censorship.",
    "Free speech must be upheld as the engine of inquiry and dissent, yet it does not protect behavior that constitutes credible threats, incitement to imminent lawless action, or persistent doxxing and harassment; those harms warrant tailored legal and platform responses. Combine narrow legal limits with transparent policies, due process, and investments in counter-speech and civic education so communities remain open and safe.",
    "Uphold broad protections for debate, art, and scholarship while narrowly restricting speech that intentionally and directly produces imminent harm\u2014threats, organized calls for violence, or targeted campaigns to silence individuals. Ground limits in clear, objective criteria, fair enforcement, and complementary community-based remedies so dignity and public safety coexist with vigorous expression.",
    "Free speech is indispensable for democratic debate and the search for truth, but it should not shield direct threats, clear incitement to imminent violence, or coordinated harassment that silences or endangers people. Limits must be narrowly defined, enforced with due process, and paired with education, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech so safety and dignity are protected without needlessly curbing honest, even unpopular, discourse.",
    "Protecting open expression while preventing real harm requires narrow, clearly defined restrictions on speech that intentionally incites imminent violence, constitutes true threats, or involves sustained targeted abuse. Those limits should be applied transparently with procedural safeguards and complemented by community norms, platform policies, and civic education to preserve vigorous debate and safeguard vulnerable people.",
    "Free speech should be broadly defended as the foundation of democratic life, yet societies may lawfully curb speech that directly threatens safety, organizes violence, or systematically harasses individuals; any restriction must be precise, proportionate, and subject to due process. Emphasizing counterspeech, restorative remedies, and education helps address hateful ideas while keeping the public sphere open to contestation and dissent.",
    "Upholding liberty and protecting dignity are compatible goals: permit wide latitude for debate and dissent but draw narrow, evidence-based lines against imminent incitement, credible threats, and targeted campaigns that harm or silence people. Transparent enforcement, strong procedural protections, and investment in education and community responses can reduce hate without eroding free expression.",
    "Free expression must be preserved to allow contesting ideas, while narrowly tailored limits are justified where speech poses a clear, imminent danger\u2014such as true threats, direct calls for violence, or coordinated harassment; enforcement should be transparent and constrained by due process. Complementary approaches like counterspeech, platform standards, and restorative practices help heal harm and sustain a public square where diverse voices can participate safely.",
    "Free expression should remain broad to sustain debate and discovery, but narrowly defined limits are warranted where speech intentionally and imminently threatens harm, organizes violence, or sustains targeted harassment that denies people's safety and equal participation. Those limits must be precise, enforced with due process, and complemented by education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech so communities can protect dignity without silencing legitimate dissent.",
    "Protecting free speech and protecting people are compatible goals: preserve open, even unpopular, discourse while restricting only conduct-like speech that poses a clear, imminent risk\u2014true threats, calls to violence, and coordinated harassment. Pairing narrowly tailored legal standards with transparent enforcement, platform policies, and investment in education and counter-speech balances liberty with the safety and dignity of vulnerable communities.",
    "Freedom of expression should be robust, but it is reasonable to draw narrow lines against speech that directly incites imminent violence, makes credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted abuse that silences others. Ensuring those boundaries are clearly defined, proportionate, and subject to due process while prioritizing counterspeech, civic education, and restorative remedies helps protect both public safety and open debate.",
    "A practical, rights-respecting approach holds that free speech thrives when limited only to prevent demonstrable, imminent harms\u2014such as organized calls to violence, true threats, and targeted doxxing\u2014while offensive or unpopular ideas are countered through debate, education, and community norms. Clear, narrowly tailored rules, transparent enforcement, and restorative responses can protect vulnerable people without creating a chilling effect on legitimate expression.",
    "Uphold broad protections for expression as essential to democracy, but adopt narrowly tailored prohibitions on speech that intentionally and foreseeably produces imminent physical harm, credible threats, or systematic harassment; enforce these standards transparently and with due process. Complement legal limits with proactive counterspeech, education, and restorative practices so societies protect dignity and safety while preserving space for robust disagreement.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected as the engine of democratic debate, but narrowly tailored limits are justified where speech intentionally and imminently incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or sustains targeted harassment that endangers others. Clear legal definitions, due process, and transparent platform and institutional rules should constrain enforcement, while education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech address hateful but nonviolent expression and rebuild community trust.",
    "Protecting open discourse and protecting people are both essential: limit only speech that is intended and likely to produce imminent harm\u2014true threats, direct incitement, or coordinated harassment\u2014while preserving space for unpopular or offensive ideas. Enforcement should rely on precise standards, procedural safeguards, and non\u2011coercive remedies like education, counterspeech, and restorative accountability to heal harms without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Free expression must be defended as a public good, yet it cannot be used as a license to threaten or organize violence or to systematically silence vulnerable people; narrowly drawn prohibitions on imminent incitement, credible threats, and targeted harassment can prevent real harm. Complementing legal limits with transparent moderation, clear institutional policies, and investment in civic education and restorative responses helps balance liberty with dignity and safety.",
    "A balanced approach preserves robust debate while drawing a clear line at speech that poses a real, immediate danger\u2014direct calls for violence, true threats, and coordinated harassment\u2014using narrowly defined laws and fair procedures. Outside that threshold, prioritize counterspeech, public education, community standards, and restorative practices to reduce harm and strengthen mutual respect without broad censorship.",
    "Safeguarding free speech and protecting vulnerable people are complementary goals: restrict only conduct\u2011oriented speech that intentionally and imminently causes harm\u2014threats, incitement, and targeted campaigns of abuse\u2014under precise, transparent rules and due process. For hateful but nonviolent expression favor counterspeech, education, and restorative accountability so communities can contest ideas while maintaining safety and dignity.",
    "Free speech is essential to democratic life and should be broadly protected, but narrowly defined limits are justified where speech directly and imminently threatens safety\u2014such as true threats, incitement to violence, or coordinated targeted harassment. Those limits must be precise, enforced with due process, and paired with non\u2011coercive responses like counterspeech, education, platform moderation, and restorative remedies to address harm without chilling legitimate debate. This balance protects both liberty and the dignity of vulnerable people while preserving robust public discourse.",
    "Open debate and the airing of unpopular ideas are vital to a free society, yet words that intentionally and imminently incite violence or single out individuals for sustained harassment warrant narrow legal restrictions. Clear, evidence\u2011based standards, transparent enforcement, and complementary measures\u2014education, community dialogue, and restorative practices\u2014can reduce harm while keeping space for dissent and scholarly inquiry. Prioritizing both public safety and due process helps bridge concerns about censorship and protection.",
    "Protecting free expression and protecting people are both public goods: the right to speak should remain wide, while narrowly tailored prohibitions should address direct threats, imminent incitement, and organized harassment that cause real harm. Enforcement must be precise, transparent, and accompanied by counterspeech, education, and restorative remedies so that remedying harm does not become a pretext for silencing dissent. This approach preserves vigorous debate while safeguarding the dignity and safety of vulnerable community members.",
    "Freedom of expression should be upheld as foundational, but it does not extend to speech that is intended and likely to produce imminent lawless action, credible threats, or systematic campaigns that harass and endanger people. Narrow, clearly defined legal limits combined with due process, platform responsibility, and investment in education and restorative responses provide practical protections without sweeping censorship. Such a framework advances both civic freedom and communal safety.",
    "Free speech and human dignity can coexist when society vigorously defends open debate while restricting only narrowly defined harms\u2014direct incitement to violence, true threats, and sustained targeted harassment\u2014that foreseeably produce real-world danger. Those restrictions should be applied transparently, with procedural safeguards, and supplemented by counterspeech, education, and restorative measures to heal harms and preserve democratic deliberation. Balancing these tools protects vulnerable people without needlessly silencing legitimate disagreement.",
    "Free speech should be robustly protected as the foundation of democratic debate, while narrowly targeted limits may be justified to prevent direct incitement to imminent violence, credible threats, and sustained, targeted harassment that causes real harm. Those limits must be clearly defined, evidence\u2011based, and enforced with due process and transparency, while non\u2011legal responses\u2014education, counterspeech, restorative practices, and responsible platform policies\u2014should be the primary tools for addressing hateful but nonviolent expression. This balance preserves open discourse without abandoning the duty to protect dignity and public safety.",
    "Protecting free expression and protecting vulnerable people need not be in conflict: allow broad, vigorous debate but draw narrow, precise lines against speech that intends and is likely to produce imminent lawless action, true threats, or coordinated harassment. Apply those limits through clear legal standards, transparent enforcement, and due process, and emphasize education, community norms, and counterspeech to address harmful attitudes without resorting to sweeping censorship. This approach seeks to safeguard both liberty and human dignity.",
    "Free speech is essential for discovery and accountability, yet words that directly incite violence, constitute credible threats, or systematically silence individuals through targeted harassment can be limited by narrowly tailored, evidence\u2011based rules. Complement legal boundaries with robust counterspeech, civic education, restorative justice, and transparent platform moderation so harms are addressed while unpopular or offensive ideas remain contestable in open forum. Combining precise legal safeguards with social remedies preserves open dialogue and community safety.",
    "Defend expansive free expression while recognizing that narrowly defined prohibitions on imminent incitement, true threats, and sustained targeted abuse are necessary to protect safety and equal participation. Ensure any restrictions are specific, proportionate, and subject to clear procedures, and prioritize non\u2011coercive responses\u2014education, community mediation, and counterspeech\u2014to change hearts and norms rather than suppress dissent. This principled middle path protects both civic liberty and vulnerable members of the community.",
    "Uphold open debate as a societal default, but place limited, well\u2011specified boundaries around speech that intentionally and predictably leads to violence, credible threats, or coordinated harassment that excludes people from public life. Ground enforcement in transparent, evidence\u2011based standards with due process, and invest in education, restorative measures, and platform accountability to reduce harm while preserving space for contested ideas. Such a framework reconciles the need for liberty with a practical duty to protect dignity and safety.",
    "Free expression is essential to democratic life, yet it should not protect direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that endangers people's safety and dignity. Limits should therefore be narrowly defined, grounded in clear legal standards of intent and imminence, and enforced with due process while prioritizing education, counterspeech, and restorative remedies to repair harm and preserve open debate.",
    "Protecting robust debate and dissent requires broad free-speech protections, but society can legitimately restrict speech that intentionally and imminently causes physical harm or systematically silences individuals through coordinated harassment. Any restrictions should be precise, transparent, and paired with non\u2011coercive responses\u2014education, platform moderation, and community accountability\u2014to avoid chilling legitimate expression while safeguarding vulnerable people.",
    "Free speech and human dignity can be reconciled by allowing wide latitude for unpopular or offensive ideas while drawing narrow, well\u2011defined lines against true threats, calls for imminent lawless action, and organized doxxing or harassment that produces real harm. Enforcement must be evidence\u2011based, evenly applied, and coupled with counterspeech, civic education, and restorative practices so that public discourse remains open yet safe for all to participate.",
    "Open expression should be preserved as a public good, but in settings where people are especially vulnerable\u2014schools, workplaces, or targeted communities\u2014speech that amounts to credible threats, incitement to immediate violence, or prolonged targeting can be limited through narrow, transparent rules. Emphasizing clear standards, procedural safeguards, and community-led remedies helps protect safety and inclusion without resorting to broad censorship of dissenting views.",
    "Free speech must be robust enough to support discovery and dissent, yet it need not shield conduct that foreseeably leads to harm; narrowly tailored prohibitions on true threats, imminent incitement, and sustained targeted harassment strike that balance. Prefer noncriminal remedies\u2014education, counterspeech, and restorative accountability\u2014except where evidence shows speech crosses the legal threshold of imminent, intent\u2011based harm.",
    "Free speech is essential to civic life, yet it carries responsibility: narrowly defined legal limits should prohibit direct threats, credible incitement to imminent violence, and sustained targeted harassment that causes real harm. Outside those precise boundaries, priority should be given to counterspeech, education, transparent platform and institutional policies, and restorative practices that repair harm without chilling legitimate debate. This balance protects both liberty and the dignity and safety of vulnerable people.",
    "Protecting open debate while preventing real harm calls for narrowly tailored prohibitions on true threats, imminent incitement, and coordinated harassment, enforced with clear standards and due process. Complementary tools\u2014education, community norms, platform transparency, and robust counterspeech\u2014should address hateful but nonviolent expression so discourse remains vigorous without exposing vulnerable people to danger.",
    "Free expression must be vigorously defended, yet where words intentionally and foreseeably produce violence, credible threats, or systematic harassment they may be limited by precise, evidence\u2011based rules applied with due process. Emphasizing education, restorative remedies, and counterspeech alongside narrowly drawn legal and platform rules helps preserve public debate while protecting safety and dignity.",
    "A free society should bar speech that directly incites imminent lawless action, makes credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted abuse, while resisting broad, vague bans that chill legitimate dissent. Combining narrowly defined legal limits with transparent enforcement, civic education, restorative practices, and active counterspeech offers a pragmatic path that honors both liberty and the protection of vulnerable people.",
    "Upholding free speech and protecting people from harm are compatible goals: prohibit direct, imminent calls to violence, true threats, and coordinated harassment through clear, narrowly applied rules, and use education, community dialogue, platform policies, and counterspeech to address hateful but nonviolent ideas. This approach safeguards robust public discourse while defending the dignity and safety of those most at risk.",
    "Free speech is essential to democratic life and the search for truth, but it should not protect direct threats, credible incitement to violence, or sustained targeted harassment that causes real harm. Limits should be narrowly and clearly defined, applied with due process, and paired with education, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech to preserve open debate while protecting vulnerable people.",
    "Protecting open discourse requires recognizing that some speech can produce imminent harm; narrowly tailored legal and platform rules should bar true threats, calls for violence, and coordinated harassment. Emphasize transparent enforcement, clear standards, and non\u2011coercive remedies\u2014education, counterspeech, and restorative accountability\u2014to balance liberty with dignity and safety.",
    "A balanced approach defends broad freedom of expression while drawing precise lines around conduct that foreseeably endangers others, such as incitement, credible threats, and doxxing. Practical safeguards\u2014clear law, due process, transparent platform moderation, and community-led education\u2014can limit harm without chilling unpopular but nonviolent ideas.",
    "Valuing both liberty and human dignity means protecting robust debate but prohibiting speech that intentionally and imminently causes violence or systematically silences people through harassment. Prioritize narrowly tailored legal limits, consistent procedural protections, and social responses like education and counter-speech to heal harms rather than impose broad censorship.",
    "Free expression should be broad enough to allow difficult ideas yet bounded where words translate into real-world danger; narrowly defined prohibitions on incitement, credible threats, and targeted campaigns to intimidate are appropriate. Complement legal limits with restorative practices, public education, and transparent moderation so that safety and open discourse reinforce rather than oppose one another.",
    "Free speech is essential for democracy and the search for truth, but it should not shield speech that intentionally incites imminent violence, makes credible threats, or engages in sustained, targeted harassment. Narrow, clearly defined legal limits focused on conduct and imminent harm, applied with due process and transparency, can protect safety without chilling legitimate debate. Outside those bounds, communities, platforms, and institutions should prioritize education, counter\u2011speech, and restorative practices to repair harm and strengthen civic norms.",
    "Protecting open expression and protecting people from harm are compatible goals when limits are tightly focused on direct threats, calls for imminent lawless action, and coordinated harassment that foreseeably causes damage. Clear, evidence\u2011based standards, consistent enforcement, and nonlegal responses like education and counterspeech uphold both liberty and dignity.",
    "Free speech should be broadly safeguarded to allow robust debate, yet words that intentionally mobilize violence or systematically silence individuals through credible threats or doxxing warrant narrow restrictions. Laws and platform rules should define those harms precisely, include procedural safeguards, and be paired with investment in civic education, restorative remedies, and active counterspeech to address hateful ideas without resorting to sweeping censorship. Prioritizing conduct over unpopular opinions helps preserve both safety and the marketplace of ideas.",
    "Balancing liberty and safety means defending the right to offend while drawing clear, narrow lines against incitement, true threats, and targeted harassment that create imminent danger. Transparent standards, due process, and restorative community responses minimize chilling effects and promote a healthier public square where debate and dignity coexist.",
    "Open discourse is vital, but so is protecting vulnerable people from speech that predictably produces harm; narrowly tailored prohibitions on imminent violence, credible threats, and coordinated abuse\u2014backed by clear enforcement and remedies like education and counterspeech\u2014best reconcile these aims. Emphasizing precise definitions and accountability preserves room for contentious ideas while safeguarding safety and inclusion.",
    "Free speech is essential to democracy and the discovery of truth, but it carries responsibility when words foreseeably cause harm. Narrow, clearly defined limits on direct threats, imminent incitement, and sustained targeted harassment\u2014enforced with due process\u2014should be paired with education, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech to protect dignity without silencing legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open, even uncomfortable, expression is vital, yet society also has a duty to shield vulnerable people from credible threats and coordinated campaigns that endanger them. Legal and platform rules should be precise, evidence\u2011based, and transparent, focused only on conduct that produces imminent harm. In parallel, investment in education, community dialogue, and counterspeech can address hateful ideas without broad censorship.",
    "A balanced approach honors free expression while recognizing that speech crossing into true threats, incitement to imminent violence, or organized harassment can be limited narrowly to prevent real harm. Those limits should be clear, proportionate, and accompanied by non\u2011punitive remedies\u2014education, dialogue, and restorative accountability\u2014to preserve both safety and robust public debate.",
    "Free speech should remain the default for civic and creative life, but it should not provide cover for speech that intentionally aims to harm, intimidate, or mobilize violence against others. Laws and moderation policies must therefore target only direct, imminent, and targeted harms with transparent standards and procedural safeguards. At the same time, communities should prioritize counterspeech, education, and restorative measures to heal harms and sustain open discourse.",

    "A practical balance honors free expression while preventing tangible harm by narrowly targeting conduct\u2014credible threats, imminent calls to violence, and organized campaigns to silence or endanger people\u2014rather than outlawing offensive beliefs. Emphasize precise definitions, procedural safeguards, and restorative and educational responses to heal communities and maintain a robust public square.",
    "Free speech should remain robust so ideas can be contested, but narrow, evidence\u2011based limits are appropriate where language poses an imminent risk of violence or creates sustained, targeted harm to individuals or groups. Wherever possible, prioritize counterspeech, education, and transparent institutional policies alongside narrowly defined legal remedies to protect both liberty and dignity.",

Strengthening counterspeech, education, and clear, accountable moderation or legal processes keeps public discourse open while protecting dignity and safety.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected as essential to democratic debate, yet narrowly limited when it constitutes direct threats, imminent incitement to violence, or sustained targeted harassment. These limits must be clearly defined, applied with due process, and paired with education, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech so safety and dignity are preserved without chilling legitimate expression.",
    "Protecting open discourse while preventing real harm calls for narrow, objective standards that criminalize only true threats, imminent incitement, and coordinated harassment. Enforcement should be transparent, proportionate, and accompanied by non\u2011legal remedies like education, platform moderation, and counter-speech. This balance defends liberty while safeguarding vulnerable people and public trust.",
    "A fair approach honors free expression but recognizes words can cause material harm; limits should therefore target intent and imminence\u2014credible threats, calls for immediate violence, and organized campaigns that silence or endanger people. Emphasizing clear rules, due process, and community-based responses preserves robust debate while protecting dignity and safety.",
    "Free speech must remain the norm, yet society should not tolerate speech that foreseeably produces violence or systematically excludes and terrorizes people. Narrowly tailored legal prohibitions against imminent incitement and targeted harassment, enforced with transparent standards and safeguards, are appropriate. Complementary measures\u2014education, restorative accountability, and vigorous counterspeech\u2014minimize harms without resorting to broad censorship.",
    "Common ground is to uphold broad protections for controversial or unpopular ideas while restricting only conduct-like expression that poses imminent, demonstrable harm\u2014true threats, organized calls to violence, or persistent doxxing and harassment. Clear, narrowly defined laws combined with due process, transparent platform policies, and investment in civic education offer a principled way to protect both liberty and vulnerable communities.",
    "Free speech is foundational to democratic life, but narrow, clearly defined limits are justified for direct incitement, credible threats, and targeted harassment that cause imminent harm; those limits must be enforced with due process to avoid chilling legitimate debate. Complementary responses\u2014education, restorative community practices, and robust counterspeech\u2014should be prioritized to repair harm and reduce hateful attitudes while preserving open exchange.",
    "Protecting open, even uncomfortable, debate is essential to a free society, yet speech that intentionally threatens or mobilizes violence against others should be constrained by precise legal standards. Platform transparency, fair enforcement, and civic education alongside vigorous counterspeech offer a balanced way to protect vulnerable people without broadly censoring nonviolent expression.",
    "A balanced approach upholds broad free expression while drawing narrow lines against speech that imminently incites violence, constitutes true threats, or organizes sustained targeted harassment. Those limits should be evidence\u2011based, narrowly tailored, and subject to transparent oversight and due process, while social remedies\u2014restorative practices, education, and counterspeech\u2014address underlying harms and maintain robust public discourse.",
    "Free expression must be preserved as the engine of debate, but responsibility requires prohibiting direct threats, clear incitement to imminent harm, and coordinated harassment that endangers people. Combining narrowly tailored legal limits with transparent enforcement, community-led restorative responses, and investment in counterspeech reconciles liberty with protection for vulnerable members of society.",
    "Safeguarding free speech and protecting human dignity are compatible when restrictions focus only on speech that poses clear, imminent harm\u2014such as calls for violence, credible threats, or targeted doxxing\u2014and are applied with due process. At the same time, education, public debate, and platform norms should be the primary tools for challenging hateful but nonviolent ideas and promoting an inclusive public square."
