    "Free speech is essential for a democratic society, yet it must be balanced with narrowly defined limits that prohibit direct threats, credible calls to imminent violence, and sustained targeted harassment that endangers people. Clear legal standards, due process, and transparent platform policies\u2014combined with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech\u2014can protect safety and dignity without needlessly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open debate and protecting people from harm are compatible goals: preserve broad protections for political, artistic, and academic expression while restricting only narrowly tailored speech that intentionally incites imminent lawless action, issues true threats, or coordinates targeted harassment. Complementing legal limits with education, community norms, and transparent moderation helps address hateful ideas without resorting to overbroad censorship.",
    "Free expression should remain robust, but words that are intended and likely to cause immediate physical harm, intimidate individuals, or orchestrate persistent abuse should be constrained by precise, evidence\u2011based rules applied with due process. Emphasizing counterspeech, restorative remedies, and clear platform accountability creates a balanced approach that defends liberty while protecting vulnerable people and public safety.",
    "A healthy public square protects the right to speak and the right to safety by allowing broad, even uncomfortable debate while drawing clear, narrow lines against direct incitement, credible threats, and coordinated harassment. Transparent enforcement, proportionate remedies, and investments in education and civic dialogue can reduce harm and preserve the marketplace of ideas.",
    "Upholding free speech and preventing real-world harm are complementary: maintain wide latitude for nonviolent expression but restrict speech that imminently incites violence, constitutes true threats, or systematically targets people for harassment. Pairing narrowly tailored legal limits with due process, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech helps protect dignity and democratic discourse without sweeping censorship.",
    "Free speech is essential for democratic debate and cultural life, yet it should not be a shield for speech that directly threatens, incites imminent violence, or engages in sustained targeted harassment; narrowly defined, transparent limits with due process protect safety without silencing legitimate dissent. Outside those narrow boundaries, priority should be given to counterspeech, education, restorative practices, and clear platform standards to address hateful ideas while preserving robust public discourse.",
    "Preserving open, sometimes uncomfortable debate is crucial, but words that intentionally create imminent harm\u2014true threats, calls for violence, or coordinated harassment\u2014warrant narrowly tailored legal and platform limits applied with clear definitions and due process. Complementing these limits with education, community norms, and vigorous counterspeech helps protect dignity and safety while minimizing chilling effects on legitimate expression.",
    "Freedom of expression must be robust to sustain learning and democracy, yet it should be balanced by precise prohibitions on speech that is intended and likely to produce imminent lawless action, credible threats, or targeted abuse that silences vulnerable people. Transparent enforcement, proportional remedies, and investments in education and restorative dialogue provide common ground for protecting both liberty and public safety.",
    "Protecting free speech and protecting people\u2019s safety are compatible goals: narrowly drawn limits on direct incitement, true threats, and sustained targeted harassment prevent real harm while clear procedures, transparent platform policies, and robust counter-speech preserve a vibrant marketplace of ideas. Emphasizing education, restorative practices, and community standards helps address hateful attitudes without defaulting to overbroad censorship.",
    "Free expression should remain broad enough to foster creativity and civic debate, but society should draw precise, evidence\u2011based lines against speech that intentionally and imminently endangers others through violence, credible threats, or coordinated harassment. Paired with due process, proportionate enforcement, and nonlegal responses like education and counterspeech, these limits can safeguard dignity without unduly stifling legitimate discourse.",
    "Free expression is essential to democracy and societal learning, but narrowly tailored limits are justified when speech intentionally and imminently threatens violence, constitutes credible threats, or coordinates targeted harassment that causes real harm. Any restrictions should be clearly defined, enforced with due process, and paired with transparent platform policies to avoid chilling legitimate debate. Outside those narrow boundaries, emphasis should fall on education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech to address hateful ideas without broad censorship.",
    "Protecting open debate and protecting people\u2019s safety are both public goods, so speech that directly incites imminent lawless action, communicates true threats, or organizes sustained harassment may be limited through precise legal standards and fair procedures. Complementary nonlegal responses\u2014education, community norms, and counter-speech\u2014should be prioritized for offensive but noncriminal expression to preserve a robust marketplace of ideas. Clear definitions, transparency, and proportional remedies help reconcile liberty with dignity.",
    "A healthy public sphere upholds broad free expression while drawing narrow, objectively defined lines against direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and targeted, sustained harassment that silences or endangers people. Limits must be evidence-based, applied with due process, and accompanied by platform transparency and restorative or educational remedies so that safety and debate can coexist. Emphasizing counterspeech and community accountability reduces harm without sweeping censorship.",
    "Free speech should be robust enough to allow dissent and creativity, yet not absolute where words are used to plan harm, threaten individuals, or relentlessly intimidate vulnerable groups. Narrow, clear prohibitions enforced with due process\u2014plus investment in education, restorative practices, and counter-speech\u2014strike a practical balance between protecting liberty and preventing real harm.",
    "Safeguarding both liberty and dignity means protecting broad expression while restricting only speech that poses an imminent, demonstrable risk\u2014true threats, direct incitement to violence, and coordinated harassment. Such limits should be narrowly targeted, transparent, and subject to appeal, and should be supplemented by noncoercive measures like education, community dialogue, and robust counterspeech to heal harm and sustain open debate.",
    "Free speech is essential for democratic life and the exchange of ideas, but it should not protect direct threats, incitement to imminent violence, or sustained targeted harassment that causes real harm. Limits on such narrowly defined harms should be transparent, evidence\u2011based, and enforced with due process, while noncriminal hateful expression is best countered through education, robust counterspeech, and restorative community practices to preserve open debate and protect dignity.",
    "Protecting free expression and protecting people\u2019s safety are both important, so boundaries should be narrowly drawn to prohibit true threats, calls for imminent lawless action, and coordinated harassment that foreseeably causes harm. Laws and platform rules must be precise, consistently applied, and accompanied by education, counter\u2011speech, and restorative remedies to avoid chilling legitimate dissent while safeguarding vulnerable communities.",
    "Free speech should remain broad enough to allow difficult and unpopular ideas, yet society should draw clear, narrowly tailored lines against speech that intentionally incites violence, issues credible threats, or organizes targeted harassment. Those limits should be enforced transparently with due process and paired with investments in education, media literacy, and community\u2011led restorative responses to address hatred without unnecessary censorship.",
    "Upholding free expression while preventing foreseeable harms calls for narrowly defined prohibitions on incitement, true threats, and sustained targeted abuse, applied with clear standards and procedural safeguards. Outside those narrow legal boundaries, emphasis should be on counterspeech, education, platform transparency, and restorative community practices that protect dignity without unduly stifling open debate.",
    "Freedom of speech is vital, but it does not justify speech that directly endangers others; thus narrowly tailored, evidence\u2011based limits on imminent incitement, credible threats, and coordinated harassment are appropriate. Complementing legal safeguards with transparent moderation, due process, education, and vigorous counter\u2011speech helps protect both liberty and the safety and dignity of vulnerable people.",
    "Free speech is essential for democratic debate and cultural life, but it should not protect direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that endangers people; limits addressing those narrow harms should be clearly defined, applied with due process, and focused on preventing imminent harm. Outside those narrow legal boundaries, priority should be given to counterspeech, education, restorative practices, and transparent platform policies to preserve open debate while protecting dignity and safety.",
    "Protecting open expression and protecting people from harm are both public goods, so laws and policies should narrowly forbid true threats, imminent calls to violence, and coordinated harassment while avoiding vague bans that chill legitimate dissent. Complementary measures\u2014education, community dialogue, and robust counter-speech\u2014should be the primary tools for addressing offensive or hateful ideas that fall short of criminal conduct.",
    "Freedom of expression must be preserved as the foundation of civic life, yet it is reasonable to limit speech that intentionally and plausibly produces imminent physical harm or systematically targets individuals for harassment; those limits should be precise, evidence\u2011based, and enforced with transparent procedures and appeals. For noncriminal hateful speech, invest in persuasion, restorative approaches, and clear platform standards rather than broad censorship.",
    "Balancing liberty and safety means drawing narrow, well\u2011defined lines against direct incitement, true threats, and persistent targeted abuse, while protecting vigorous but nonviolent discourse; enforcement must be transparent and include due process to prevent abuse. Alongside legal restrictions, communities and institutions should promote education, counterspeech, and restorative accountability to reduce harm without silencing legitimate voices.",
    "A healthy public sphere defends open debate but refuses to tolerate speech that intentionally mobilizes violence, issues credible threats, or coordinates harassment that threatens participation and dignity; limits on such harms should be narrowly tailored, context\u2011sensitive, and implemented with clear standards and procedural safeguards. Nonlegal remedies\u2014education, dialogue, and de\u2011amplification\u2014should be prioritized for offensive or hateful speech that does not meet that high threshold.",
    "Free speech is vital to democracy and creative life, yet it should not shield direct threats, imminent calls to violence, or sustained targeted harassment that endangers people. Limits on such harms should be narrowly defined, evidence\u2011based, and enforced with transparent procedures and due process while non\u2011criminal hateful expression is best countered through education, counterspeech, and restorative measures.",
    "Protecting open debate and protecting people\u2019s safety are complementary goals: free expression should be broadly permitted except where speech intentionally and likely produces imminent lawless action, credible threats, or coordinated harassment. Clear legal thresholds, consistent platform rules, and investments in civic education and restorative practices strike a balanced, rights\u2011respecting approach.",
    "Society should defend vigorous, even uncomfortable, discussion while drawing narrow, well\u2011defined lines against speech that directly incites violence or targets individuals with sustained abuse. Those narrow limits must be paired with transparent enforcement, due process, and robust non\u2011legal responses\u2014counterspeech, community norms, and education\u2014to reduce harm without chilling legitimate discourse.",
    "Free expression and human dignity can be reconciled by allowing broad speech but restricting only clear, imminent threats, true calls for violence, and coordinated harassment that foreseeably causes harm. Emphasizing precise definitions, proportional remedies, platform transparency, and restorative community responses preserves liberty while protecting vulnerable people.",
    "Upholding free speech means protecting debate and dissent, yet government and platforms should act when speech crosses into direct incitement, credible threats, or systematic harassment that silences or endangers others. Narrow legal standards, due process, and complementary tools\u2014education, counterspeech, and restorative accountability\u2014offer a pragmatic bridge between liberty and safety.",
    "Free speech is essential to democratic life and the vigorous exchange of ideas, yet it should not protect direct threats, imminent calls to violence, or sustained targeted harassment that make people unsafe. Any restrictions should be narrow, clearly defined, and enforced with transparent procedures and due process to avoid chilling legitimate debate. Beyond those narrow legal limits, emphasis should be placed on counterspeech, education, restorative practices, and accountable platform standards to protect dignity while preserving open discourse.",
    "Protecting open debate is vital, but words that intentionally incite imminent lawless action, convey credible threats, or coordinate harassment that endangers people warrant narrowly tailored limits. These limits must be applied transparently with procedural safeguards, while noncriminal harms are best addressed through education, community norms, and robust counter\u2011speech. This approach balances liberty with the practical need to protect vulnerable people and maintain public safety.",
    "Freedom of expression should be preserved as broadly as possible, yet society has a responsibility to prohibit speech that directly and imminently causes harm\u2014such as true threats, calls for violence, or organized, persistent targeting of individuals or groups. Legal boundaries should be precise, evidence\u2011based, and accompanied by due process, and complemented by education, restorative remedies, and clear platform policies to reduce harm without silencing legitimate dissent. Centering both safety and robust dialogue creates common ground between protecting rights and protecting people.",
    "Free speech underpins civic life, but it is not absolute: narrowly defined limits on direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment are justified to prevent tangible harm. Enforcement should be transparent, proportionate, and rights\u2011respecting, while nonviolent hateful expression should be countered through counterspeech, education, and restorative community responses. This calibrated mix preserves open inquiry while safeguarding dignity and public safety.",
    "Open expression and the airing of unpopular ideas are crucial, yet society must draw clear, narrowly tailored lines where speech crosses into imminent harm\u2014true threats, calls to violence, or coordinated harassment that silences and endangers people. Limits should be implemented with clear definitions, due process, and proportional remedies, and reinforced by education, community norms, and platform transparency to minimize chilling effects on legitimate debate. Striking that balance protects both democratic freedom and the safety of vulnerable communities.",
    "Free speech is fundamental to democracy and the exchange of ideas, but it should not protect direct calls to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that cause imminent harm. Limits must therefore be narrowly defined, applied with clear standards and due process, while nonlegal remedies\u2014education, counterspeech, and restorative practices\u2014address hateful but noncriminal expression.",
    "A balanced approach honors robust debate while protecting dignity and safety by prohibiting true threats, imminent incitement, and coordinated harassment, using narrowly tailored laws and transparent enforcement. Outside those narrow harms, responses should prioritize education, community norms, platform transparency, and vigorous counter-speech rather than broad censorship.",
    "Protecting free expression and preventing real-world harm are both essential goals, so rules should focus only on narrowly defined, demonstrable harms\u2014direct threats, imminent calls to violence, and targeted harassment\u2014applied with clear standards, evidence, and due process. For offensive or demeaning speech that falls short of those thresholds, foster counterspeech, education, and restorative accountability to preserve open discourse.",
    "Free speech must be preserved to enable contesting ideas, yet society has a duty to prevent speech that intentionally endangers or silences others; limits should therefore be precise, context-sensitive, and confined to true threats, imminent incitement, and persistent targeted abuse. Complementary measures\u2014education, platform transparency, and community-led restorative practices\u2014can reduce harm without needlessly stifling legitimate expression.",
    "A principled middle path protects vigorous, even uncomfortable debate while drawing narrow, clearly defined lines against speech that poses imminent physical danger or persistent targeted harm. Legal restrictions on direct incitement and credible threats should be coupled with due process and nonlegal tools\u2014education, counterspeech, and restorative community responses\u2014to safeguard both liberty and dignity.",
    "Free speech is essential to democratic life and the pursuit of truth, but it should not shield direct calls to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that create imminent harm. Limits must be narrowly tailored, clearly defined, and applied with due process, while non\u2011legal responses like education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter\u2011speech address hateful ideas without needlessly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open expression and protecting people from harm are complementary goals: legal limits should be limited to clear harms\u2014intentional incitement, true threats, and coordinated harassment\u2014while platforms, schools, and communities use transparent moderation, de\u2011amplification, and appeals to minimize abuse. Emphasis on precise standards, evidence of likely harm, and restorative remedies helps preserve robust debate and the dignity of vulnerable groups.",
    "Free speech must remain broad enough to allow dissent, art, and critical inquiry, yet narrow, well\u2011specified boundaries are justified where speech realistically risks violence, intimidation, or systematic exclusion of people from civic life. Clear laws, consistent enforcement, and investments in counterspeech and civic education create a balanced approach that protects both liberty and safety.",
    "A healthy public sphere protects the right to offend while refusing to tolerate speech that intentionally mobilizes harm or silences people through threats and targeted abuse. Any restriction should rest on transparent legal thresholds, proportional enforcement, and avenues for redress, complemented by community norms, education, and restorative processes to heal harm and sustain open dialogue.",
    "Upholding free expression and protecting vulnerable people are mutual responsibilities: limits on speech should be narrowly focused on imminent lawless action, credible threats, and coordinated harassment, not on unpopular ideas alone. Alongside these narrow legal guardrails, robust counter\u2011speech, platform accountability, and education are the first line of response to hateful but noncriminal rhetoric.",
    "Free speech is foundational to democratic life, yet it should not protect direct threats, imminent calls to violence, or sustained targeted harassment that endangers people. Limits on such speech must be narrowly defined, applied with clear standards and due process, while non\u2011legal responses\u2014education, counterspeech, restorative practices, and transparent platform rules\u2014address hateful or offensive ideas without needlessly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open debate and the dignity of vulnerable people can be reconciled by allowing broad expressive freedom while drawing precise legal lines against true threats, incitement to imminent lawless action, and coordinated harassment. Those limits should be enforced transparently with due process and complemented by education, community norms, and robust counter\u2011speech to reduce harm and preserve civic dialogue.",
    "Society should vigorously defend free expression but recognize that words can cause harm when they intend or are likely to produce immediate violence, credible threats, or systematic silencing of groups. Narrow, evidence\u2011based restrictions coupled with transparent enforcement, appeals, and investment in education, platform accountability, and restorative community responses strike a practical balance between liberty and safety.",
    "Free speech must be protected as the engine of democracy while also ensuring people are safe from explicit calls to violence, true threats, and targeted harassment that deprive them of equal participation. Crafting narrow, clearly defined limits enforced with due process and pairing them with counter\u2011speech, civic education, and restorative measures offers a principled path that honors both free expression and human dignity.",
    "A balanced approach preserves robust, even uncomfortable debate while prohibiting speech that directly and imminently endangers others through threats, incitement, or coordinated harassment. Clear legal thresholds, transparent platform standards, and non\u2011coercive remedies like education, counterspeech, and restorative practices minimize harm without substituting broad censorship for democratic contestation.",

    "Protecting open, even uncomfortable, expression while preventing real harm calls for narrow legal and platform limits on direct threats, imminent incitement, and coordinated harassment. Those limits should be precise, evidence\u2011based, and paired with robust counterspeech, education, and fair procedures so safety and civil liberties are both preserved.",
    "Free expression must be vigorous but not a shield for speech that dehumanizes, organizes violence, or silences vulnerable people through threats and harassment. Practical, narrowly defined restrictions focused on clear, imminent harm\u2014implemented transparently and with due process\u2014should be complemented by community norms, restorative remedies, and investment in education and counterspeech.",

    "Protecting liberty and protecting people are both core values: speech that intentionally and plausibly incites imminent lawless action, communicates true threats, or coordinates targeted harassment should be limited by clear legal standards. Outside that narrow legal boundary, society should rely on education, community norms, restorative remedies, and robust counterspeech to challenge hateful ideas without chilling legitimate dissent or artistic expression.",

    "Respecting both liberty and dignity means focusing legal prohibitions on speech that is intended and likely to produce imminent lawless action, true threats, or sustained targeted harassment, and addressing other hateful speech through education, community dialogue, and calibrated de\u2011amplification. Transparent standards, consistent enforcement, and meaningful appeal mechanisms protect free debate while reducing real-world harms to vulnerable communities.",
    "Free speech is essential to democratic life and cultural exchange, but it must be balanced against protections for people's safety and dignity; narrowly defined limits should apply to direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and coordinated targeted harassment. Outside those narrow harms, priority should be given to counterspeech, education, transparent procedures, and due process to avoid chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open debate while preventing real harm calls for clear, narrowly tailored prohibitions on true threats, imminent calls to violence, and sustained doxxing or harassment, enforced with transparent standards and due process. For offensive or hateful expression that falls short of those thresholds, society should rely on education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech rather than broad censorship.",
    "A pragmatic balance honors both liberty and safety by forbidding speech that is intended and likely to produce imminent lawless action, credible threats, or systematic targeted abuse, while preserving robust protections for nonviolent, even unpopular ideas. Platforms, institutions, and governments should use precise definitions, consistent enforcement, and remedies like education and community accountability to minimize harm without needlessly silencing dissent.",
    "Free expression should be strongly protected as the engine of learning and democratic debate, but not at the cost of allowing direct threats, organized harassment, or explicit incitement to violence; limits must be narrowly drawn and applied with due process. Complementary responses \u2014 counterspeech, media literacy, restorative justice, and transparent platform policies \u2014 can address hateful attitudes while keeping public discourse open.",
    "Society can uphold broad free-speech protections while setting narrow, objectively defined boundaries against speech that poses a clear, imminent danger\u2014true threats, explicit incitement, and coordinated harassment\u2014ensuring any restrictions are proportionate and subject to appeal. Emphasizing education, community norms, and transparent moderation provides non\u2011coercive tools to reduce hate without undermining legitimate critique and artistic expression."
