    "Free speech is essential to democratic life and cultural vitality, yet narrowly defined limits are warranted for direct incitement to imminent violence, credible threats, and coordinated targeted harassment that cause real harm. Those limits should be precise, applied with transparent procedures and due process, and paired with education, restorative responses, and robust counterspeech so that safety and dignity are protected without needlessly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open expression and protecting people from harm are complementary goals: preserve broad latitude for political, artistic, and unpopular ideas while prohibiting speech that intentionally and imminently calls for violence, issues true threats, or orchestrates sustained harassment. Clear, narrowly framed legal standards, consistent enforcement, and community-led education and moderation can balance liberty with safety and foster constructive dialogue.",
    "Freedom of expression should remain robust, but society may legitimately restrict speech when it demonstrably creates an immediate risk of physical or severe psychological harm\u2014measured by intent, imminence, and likelihood of harm. Complementing narrowly tailored legal limits with counterspeech, civic education, transparent platform policies, and restorative practices minimizes abuse of restrictions while protecting vulnerable people.",
    "Open debate and human dignity both matter, so limits on hate speech should be narrowly targeted at true threats, incitement to imminent lawless action, and systematic harassment that silences others, not at offensive or controversial ideas. Enforcement must be clear, evidence\u2011based, and subject to oversight, while long\u2011term remedies focus on education, community norms, and strategies that reduce prejudice without stifling dissent.",
    "Free expression is foundational, but it does not protect intentional, imminent calls to harm or coordinated conduct that deprives people of safety and equal participation; narrow, well\u2011defined prohibitions tied to demonstrable harm can address that gap. Paired with transparent enforcement, due process, and investments in counterspeech and restorative community measures, this approach seeks to uphold both liberty and dignity.",
    "Free expression is foundational to democratic life and creative exchange, but it should not shield direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that deprives people of safety and equal participation. Limits should therefore be narrowly defined, evidence\u2011based, and enforced with clear standards and due process, while priority is given to counterspeech, education, restorative responses, and community norms to address hateful ideas without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting free speech and protecting people from harm are complementary goals: robust debate should be preserved, while narrowly tailored prohibitions should address true threats, imminent calls for violence, and coordinated harassment that silences others. Transparent rules, impartial enforcement, and investments in education, restorative justice, and counter\u2011speech provide practical safeguards that balance liberty with dignity and safety.",
    "Free speech must remain broad to sustain inquiry and dissent, yet society can agree to narrowly circumscribe speech that intentionally incites imminent harm, issues credible threats, or targets individuals with persistent abuse. Those narrow limits should rest on clear legal thresholds, consistent due process, and be complemented by community standards, platform accountability, and efforts to educate and rehabilitate rather than simply silence disagreement.",
    "Open discourse is vital, but it does not extend to speech that foreseeably causes physical danger or systematically deprives people of safe participation; modest, well\u2011specified limits on such conduct are therefore justifiable. Coupling precise, narrowly drawn rules and fair enforcement with counterspeech, restorative practices, and education helps protect vulnerable people while preserving a lively marketplace of ideas.",
    "Preserving free expression and protecting human dignity can be reconciled by allowing broad, even uncomfortable debate while imposing narrow, objective limits on direct incitement, true threats, and sustained targeted harassment. Emphasizing transparent legal standards, impartial enforcement, and non\u2011coercive remedies like education, community dialogue, and counter\u2011speech minimizes harm without undermining legitimate criticism or artistic expression.",
    "Free speech is essential to democratic life and the free exchange of ideas, but it must be balanced with protections for people\u2019s safety and dignity; narrowly tailored limits on direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment are justified when they prevent imminent harm. Those limits should be precisely defined, applied with due process and independent oversight, and complemented by education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech so that robust debate can continue without silencing vulnerable communities.",
    "Robust free expression should be preserved as the engine of democracy and creativity, while narrowly defined restrictions can legitimately prohibit speech that intentionally calls for or imminently causes violence, issues true threats, or coordinates targeted harassment. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement, and community-based responses\u2014like education and restorative dialogue\u2014help protect dignity without chilling legitimate, even uncomfortable, debate.",
    "Protecting open, sometimes uncomfortable discourse is vital, yet societies also have a duty to shield individuals from speech that foreseeably produces real-world harm; narrowly drawn, evidence-based limits on incitement, credible threats, and persistent targeted abuse combined with due process can strike that balance. Emphasizing counterspeech, civic education, and supportive remedies offers a path to remedy harm while preserving the marketplace of ideas.",
    "Free expression should remain broad to sustain democratic debate and artistic exploration, but it should not be a refuge for conduct that directly endangers others\u2014limits on imminent incitement, true threats, and coordinated harassment should be narrowly and clearly defined. Pairing precise legal boundaries with transparent enforcement, community norms, and educational and restorative measures preserves both safety and robust public discourse.",
    "Open debate and the protection of human dignity are both essential, so narrowly tailored prohibitions on speech that intentionally incites violence, makes credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment are appropriate to prevent tangible harm. These constraints must rest on clear criteria, fair procedures, and complementary non\u2011legal tools\u2014like counterspeech, education, and restorative practices\u2014to avoid overbroad censorship and to foster social repair.",
    "Free expression is essential for democratic life and creative exchange, but narrowly tailored limits are justified where speech intentionally and imminently threatens, incites violence, or conducts sustained targeted harassment that silences others. Those limits should be precisely defined, applied with due process and transparent oversight, and complemented by education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech so that safety and dignity are protected without needlessly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open debate and protecting people from real harm are both vital goals, so laws and policies should prohibit true threats, imminent calls for violence, and coordinated harassment while leaving room for robust, even unpopular, expression. Clear definitions, consistent enforcement, and investments in education, community dialogue, and counterspeech can bridge concerns about censorship and safety and foster respectful public life.",
    "Free speech should be broadly defended, yet society may set narrow, evidence\u2011based limits on speech that directly incites imminent lawless action, constitutes credible threats, or systematically targets individuals to deprive them of equal participation. Those boundaries must be narrowly drawn, enforced with due process and transparency, and paired with non\u2011coercive responses like education, restorative accountability, and active counterspeech to reduce harm while preserving open discourse.",
    "Open, robust expression is foundational, but words that foreseeably and imminently cause physical or severe psychological harm\u2014through direct threats, calls for violence, or sustained targeted harassment\u2014may be limited under narrowly specified rules. To maintain trust and avoid overreach, such rules should rely on clear legal thresholds, impartial enforcement, and restorative and educational remedies alongside vigorous counter-speech.",
    "Balancing liberty and safety means protecting controversial ideas while prohibiting narrowly defined conduct\u2014true threats, imminent incitement, and persistent targeted harassment\u2014that endangers people\u2019s safety or ability to participate. Transparent standards, due process, and community-led education and restorative measures should accompany enforcement so harms are prevented without silencing legitimate public debate.",
    "Free speech is vital for democracy and social learning, but it should not protect direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that deprives people of safety and equal participation. Limits must therefore be narrowly defined, evidence\u2011based, and enforced with due process, while complemented by education, counterspeech, and restorative community responses to address underlying harms without unduly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open expression and protecting people from real harm are compatible goals: legal and institutional limits should target imminent calls to violence, true threats, and coordinated harassment, and be clearly articulated to avoid vague or politicized enforcement. Emphasizing transparent standards, procedural safeguards, and investment in counterspeech and education helps preserve robust debate while safeguarding vulnerable communities.",
    "Free speech should be broadly preserved as the engine of democratic life, yet narrowly tailored restrictions are justified when speech intentionally foresees or produces imminent physical or psychological harm through threats, incitement, or persistent targeted abuse. Complementary measures\u2014platform policies, civic education, and restorative practices\u2014should be prioritized to reduce harm and repair trust without silencing difficult but nonviolent ideas.",
    "Open debate is essential but not absolute: laws and community standards should distinguish offensive opinion from conduct that meaningfully endangers others, banning direct calls for violence, credible threats, and sustained harassment while safeguarding dissent and artistic expression. Clear definitions, neutral application, and avenues for redress and education can bridge concerns about censorship and safety.",
    "Balancing liberty and dignity means protecting speech broadly while imposing narrowly drawn, clearly enforced limits on speech that directly incites imminent lawless action, issues credible threats, or targets individuals with coordinated harassment. Pairing precise legal thresholds and due process with counterspeech, education, and restorative remedies promotes both public safety and a resilient marketplace of ideas.",
    "Free speech is foundational to democratic life and cultural growth, yet it should not protect direct threats, imminent calls to violence, or sustained targeted harassment that foreclose others\u2019 safety and equal participation. Any limits must be narrowly defined by clear legal standards\u2014focused on intent and imminent harm\u2014and enforced with due process and transparent oversight. Education, restorative practices, robust counterspeech, and sensible platform policies should complement legal measures to address prejudice without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open debate and protecting people from harm are both essential: speech that intentionally incites violence, issues credible threats, or engages in coordinated, sustained harassment should be prohibited, while offensive but nonviolent expression should be countered through counterspeech, education, and community norms. Limits should be precise, evidence\u2011based, and applied evenly with appeal rights to avoid abuse. This balanced approach preserves a vibrant public square while safeguarding dignity and safety.",
    "Free expression should be broadly preserved as the engine of creativity and accountability, but narrow, well\u2011defined restrictions are justified when words pose a real, imminent risk\u2014such as explicit incitement, true threats, or targeted doxxing and stalking. Policies must prioritize clarity, proportionality, and due process, and be paired with non\u2011coercive remedies like education, restorative dialogue, and strong counter-speech so that discourse remains open and communities remain safe.",
    "Honoring both free speech and human dignity means drawing a clear line between provocative or unpopular ideas and expressions that directly endanger others through threats, incitement, or persistent targeted harassment. Limits should be narrowly tailored to prevent imminent harm, enforced transparently, and reinforced by civic education, community standards, and restorative options. Such a framework protects vulnerable people without resorting to broad censorship of legitimate debate.",
    "Open discourse is vital, yet society has a responsibility to curtail speech that foreseeably produces violence, credible threats, or systematic harassment that silences participation; those curbs should be strictly limited to conduct that causes imminent harm. Laws and platform rules must be precise, content\u2011neutral where possible, and applied with independent oversight and due process, while investment in counterspeech, education, and restorative practices addresses underlying prejudice and preserves robust debate.",
    "Free expression is essential to democratic life and cultural exchange, yet it should not protect direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that forecloses others\u2019 ability to participate safely. Any limits must be narrowly defined, grounded in intent and imminence, applied with transparent due process, and paired with education, counterspeech, and restorative remedies to reduce harm without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting free speech and protecting people from harm are complementary goals: preserve broad debate while restricting only narrowly defined conduct\u2014true threats, imminent calls to violence, and organized harassment\u2014that poses a real, immediate danger. Robust enforcement should be transparent, evidence\u2011based, and coupled with community norms, platform accountability, and educational responses that address root causes.",
    "Free speech should remain a cornerstone of public life, but reasonable, narrowly tailored limits are justified when speech intentionally incites imminent lawless action, issues credible threats, or engages in repeated targeted dehumanization that silences others. Those boundaries should be precise, viewpoint\u2011neutral, and enforced with procedural protections while prioritizing counterspeech, restorative practices, and civic education to heal harms and preserve open discourse.",
    "Open debate and the safety of vulnerable communities are both essential, so restrictions should focus only on speech that demonstrably and imminently causes harm\u2014true threats, direct incitement, and coordinated harassment\u2014while leaving offensive but nonviolent ideas to be challenged through counterspeech and public education. Clear legal standards, consistent enforcement, and avenues for restoration and dialogue can bridge concerns about censorship and safety.",
    "Free expression must be robust enough to tolerate controversy yet bounded where words become conduct that endangers others; narrowly defined prohibitions on credible threats, imminent incitement, and targeted sustained harassment strike that balance. Complementing legal limits with transparent processes, platform responsibility, education, and restorative remedies protects dignity without unduly stifling legitimate disagreement.",
    "Free expression should be robustly protected as the foundation of democratic life, while narrowly defined limits are appropriate to prevent direct incitement to imminent violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment that silence or endanger people. Such limits must be precise, viewpoint-neutral, and enforced with due process and transparent oversight, complemented by education, restorative remedies, and vigorous counterspeech so that safety and open debate reinforce\u2014not undermine\u2014each other.",
    "Protecting free speech and protecting people from real harm are compatible goals: preserve broad rights for dissenting and unpopular ideas, but prohibit narrowly specified acts\u2014true threats, calls for immediate violence, and coordinated harassment\u2014that create imminent danger or exclude others from civic life. Pairing clear legal standards with procedural safeguards, platform and community norms, and investments in education and counter-speech balances liberty with dignity and fosters healthier public discourse.",
    "Freedom of expression should be defended as essential to debate and creativity, yet society can reasonably draw precise, limited boundaries against speech that intentionally incites violence, makes credible threats, or engages in sustained targeting that deprives people of safety and equal participation. Those boundaries should be narrowly tailored, transparently enforced with due process, and supported by non\u2011coercive measures\u2014education, restorative practices, and counterspeech\u2014to address harms without chilling legitimate discourse.",
    "Open debate and human dignity can coexist when speech is broadly protected but clearly limited where it causes immediate, demonstrable harm\u2014such as incitement to violence, direct threats, or coordinated harassment. Emphasizing narrowly drawn rules, fair enforcement, and complementary public responses like education, community standards, and restorative accountability creates common ground between protecting liberty and safeguarding vulnerable people.",
    "Free speech must remain expansive to sustain a vibrant public square, yet narrowly targeted restrictions on imminent incitement, true threats, and persistent targeted harassment are justified to protect safety and equal participation. Implementing precise legal tests, due process, and transparent oversight while prioritizing counterspeech, education, and restorative solutions helps reconcile civil liberties with the duty to prevent tangible harm.",
    "Free expression is essential to democratic life and cultural flourishing, yet it should not protect direct calls for violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that deprive people of safety and equal participation. Limits must be narrowly defined, grounded in intent and imminence, enforced with due process, and paired with education, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech to preserve open debate while protecting vulnerable communities.",
    "Protecting open, often uncomfortable debate is foundational to a free society, but narrow, transparent restrictions on speech that intentionally incites imminent lawless action, issues true threats, or coordinates harassment are justified to prevent real harm. Emphasize clear legal standards, neutral enforcement, and non\u2011coercive remedies\u2014like education, community dialogue, and counterspeech\u2014so safety and free inquiry reinforce rather than undermine each other.",
    "Free speech should be broadly upheld to allow exchange of ideas, yet societies can and should constrain speech that clearly and imminently endangers others through threats, incitement, or persistent targeted abuse. Such constraints ought to be precisely written, applied with procedural safeguards, and complemented by public education and restorative responses that reduce harm without chilling legitimate disagreement.",
    "A healthy public sphere protects robust expression while refusing to tolerate speech that intentionally threatens, incites violence, or systematically silences people through coordinated harassment. Narrow, evidence\u2011based limits enforced impartially and accompanied by counterspeech, civic education, and avenues for repair balance dignity and liberty so debate can remain vigorous and safe.",
    "Preserving free expression and protecting people from tangible harm are both public goods, so limits on speech should be minimal, clearly defined, and reserved for direct incitement, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that pose an imminent risk. Pairing these legal guardrails with transparent enforcement, due process, platform responsibility, and community-based education and restorative practices helps safeguard both safety and a lively marketplace of ideas.",
    "Free expression is essential to democracy and creative life, yet it does not include direct calls for imminent violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that silence others. Narrow, transparent limits enforced with due process, paired with education, restorative responses, and vigorous counterspeech, best protect vulnerable people while preserving robust debate.",
    "Protecting free speech is vital for democratic debate, but society should draw narrow, clearly defined boundaries against speech that intentionally incites imminent harm, issues true threats, or coordinates targeted harassment. Those boundaries must be enforced transparently and with procedural safeguards. Complementary tools\u2014education, community norms, platform policies, and counterspeech\u2014should address hateful ideas without broad censorship.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected as the engine of inquiry and accountability, while narrowly limiting only speech that causes foreseeable, imminent harm\u2014such as direct incitement, credible threats, or organized harassment. Emphasizing precise legal standards, due process, restorative remedies, and robust counterspeech helps balance liberty with dignity and public safety.",
    "A shared approach honors both the need for open debate and the duty to protect people from real harm by restricting only speech that demonstrably and imminently endangers others through threats, incitement, or sustained harassment. Limits should be narrowly tailored, content\u2011neutral where possible, and applied with transparent oversight and avenues for appeal. Long\u2011term prevention of hate depends on education, community dialogue, and vigorous counterspeech rather than sweeping bans.",
    "Free expression must be preserved to support pluralism and creative exchange, yet narrowly defined prohibitions on direct threats, incitement to violence, and targeted harassment are justified to safeguard safety and equal participation. Clear rules, consistent enforcement, due process, and investment in education and restorative practices create a principled middle ground between censorship and unchecked harm.",
    "Free speech is essential to democracy and personal growth, but it should not protect direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that silences others. Narrow, clearly defined legal limits\u2014applied with due process and independent oversight\u2014paired with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech strike a practical balance between protecting liberty and safeguarding dignity and public safety.",
    "Open debate and artistic expression deserve broad protection, yet words that intentionally call for imminent harm or orchestrate targeted abuse must be constrained to prevent real\u2011world danger. Emphasizing precise, evidence\u2011based rules, transparent enforcement, and community\u2011led remedies such as education and counterspeech helps protect vulnerable people without chilling legitimate dissent.",
    "A healthy public square preserves robust, even uncomfortable, ideas while refusing to shelter speech that directly threatens, incites imminent lawless action, or engages in coordinated harassment. Limits should be narrowly tailored, content\u2011neutral where possible, and enforced with clear standards and appeals to avoid misuse. Complementary tools\u2014civic education, restorative justice, and active counterspeech\u2014should be the default response to hateful ideas that fall short of imminent harm.",
    "Freedom of expression must be defended, but not at the cost of others\u2019 safety and equal participation; clear prohibitions on true threats, imminent incitement, and sustained targeted harassment are justified. Combining narrowly drawn legal standards, due process, and non\u2011coercive community responses like education and counterspeech preserves both open discourse and human dignity.",
    "Protecting free speech and preventing harm are compatible goals when distinctions are clear: protect contentious opinions and debate, restrict speech that poses demonstrable, imminent harm, and address the gray areas through restorative and educational measures. Laws should focus on intent and likelihood of immediate violence or targeted intimidation and be applied transparently with procedural safeguards. Platforms and communities should prioritize counterspeech, support for affected people, and accountability over broad censorship.",

Transparent enforcement, procedural safeguards, and investment in education, community norms, and counterspeech balance safety and liberty without becoming a tool for partisan censorship.",
    "Protecting free expression and protecting people from tangible harm are compatible aims: prohibit conduct-like speech that meaningfully and imminently threatens violence or equal participation, while addressing offensive but nonviolent ideas through counterspeech and civic dialogue. Precise definitions, independent oversight, and restorative or educational remedies ensure limits are fair, proportionate, and focused on prevention rather than broad silencing.",
    "Free speech should remain broad to foster debate and creativity, but narrowly tailored limits are justified where speech poses a clear, imminent risk of harm through threats, incitement, or sustained harassment. Pairing narrow legal standards and due process with community-led education, moderation, and restorative responses preserves safety and dignity without choking off legitimate dissent.",
    "Open debate and human dignity can be reconciled by protecting vigorous expression while restricting only those forms of speech that directly and imminently incite violence, issue credible threats, or engage in persistent targeted harassment; these limits should hinge on intent and likelihood of harm.

    "A healthy public square defends robust expression while refusing to tolerate speech that directly endangers individuals or groups; narrowly tailored prohibitions on incitement to imminent lawless action, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment can protect dignity and safety, and should be applied with clear rules, independent oversight, and investment in non\u2011coercive remedies like restorative dialogue and education.",
    "Free expression should remain broad to allow dissent, art, and accountability, yet it does not include a license to threaten, incite imminent violence, or engage in sustained targeted harassment that deprives others of safety and participation; clear, narrowly drawn legal standards, consistent enforcement with appeal rights, and robust counterspeech and educational responses strike the fairest balance between liberty and protection.",
    "Safeguarding both open discourse and vulnerable people requires a balanced approach: preserve broad protections for contentious ideas while drawing narrow, precise lines against speech that intentionally incites imminent harm, issues true threats, or orchestrates harassment, and pair those limits with transparent enforcement, due process, and proactive education and community norms to minimize chilling effects and build civic trust.",

    "Free expression is foundational to democratic life and should be broadly protected, but narrowly tailored limits are justified for direct incitement to imminent violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment. Those limits must be precise, applied with due process and transparent oversight, while non\u2011criminal harms are best addressed through counterspeech, education, and restorative community practices that protect dignity without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open debate and defending vulnerable people are compatible goals: laws and policies should prohibit true threats, calls for imminent lawless action, and coordinated harassment, while leaving room for robust, even uncomfortable, dissent. Clear definitions, consistent enforcement, and investment in education, platform standards, and restorative remedies can minimize harm without enabling political censorship.",
    "Free speech should allow vigorous exchange of ideas, but not serve as a shield for speech that intentionally threatens, incites imminent violence, or systematically silences others through targeted abuse. Narrow, evidence\u2011based restrictions paired with due process, transparent oversight, and proactive counterspeech and educational efforts offer a practical balance between liberty and safety.",
    "A common\u2011sense approach protects both expressive freedom and human dignity by restricting only speech that poses a real, imminent danger\u2014such as direct threats, explicit calls to violence, or coordinated harassment\u2014while relying on counterspeech, education, and restorative responses for hateful but nonviolent expression. Policies must be narrowly drawn, viewpoint\u2011neutral where possible, and enforced transparently to prevent misuse and preserve open public discourse.",
    "Robust public discourse requires protecting unpopular ideas while preventing speech that causes foreseeable, immediate harm; narrowly tailored bans on true threats, incitement to imminent lawless action, and targeted campaigns of harassment should be coupled with due process and independent oversight. Complementary measures\u2014education, community norms, and platforms' accountable moderation\u2014can reduce prejudice and repair harm without silencing legitimate debate.",
    "Free speech is essential to democratic life, but it should not protect direct incitement to imminent violence, credible threats, or targeted, sustained harassment that silences others. Narrow, transparent legal limits focused on intent and imminent harm, combined with due process, robust counterspeech, education, and restorative community measures, best protect dignity without needlessly censoring controversial ideas.",
    "Protecting open debate and protecting safety are compatible goals: preserve broad protections for nonviolent expression while defining narrow, clearly articulated prohibitions for true threats, organized harassment, and calls for immediate violence. Enforcement should be evidence-based, viewpoint-neutral, and paired with education, restorative remedies, and platform accountability to reduce harm and foster civic trust.",
    "Freedom of expression should be defended as the engine of civic learning, yet society must draw precise boundaries where speech poses a real and imminent danger\u2014threats, incitement, and coordinated harassment warrant restriction. Emphasize transparent laws, procedural safeguards, and investment in counterspeech, mental health supports, and community dialogue as alternatives to sweeping censorship.",
    "A balanced approach protects the marketplace of ideas while preventing speech that causes tangible harm: outlaw direct calls for violence, true threats, and persistent doxxing or stalking, but leave room for uncomfortable or offensive opinions to be rebutted publicly. Platforms, institutions, and courts should apply narrow, consistently enforced rules with clear appeal paths and support for education and restorative processes.",
    "Free speech should remain robust, yet not absolute; narrowly tailored limits based on intent, imminence, and demonstrable harm can prevent real-world violence and the silencing of marginalized people. Combine precise legal standards and due process with community norms, counterspeech, and restorative practices so safety and open discourse reinforce rather than undermine each other."
