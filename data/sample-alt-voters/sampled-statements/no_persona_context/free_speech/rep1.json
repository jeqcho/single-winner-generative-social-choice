    "Free expression is essential to democracy and cultural life, but it should not protect targeted threats, incitement to imminent violence, or sustained coordinated harassment that endangers people\u2019s safety and dignity. Limits should be narrowly defined, enforced with clear standards and due process, while non-criminal hateful speech is best countered through education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech so debate and protection of vulnerable communities coexist.",
    "Protecting broad free speech while preventing direct harm are compatible goals: narrowly restrict true threats, calls for imminent violence, and organized harassment, using precise legal tests and transparent enforcement. For all other offensive speech prioritize noncoercive responses\u2014education, community norms, and robust counterspeech\u2014to preserve open inquiry and repair harms without sweeping censorship.",
    "Free speech should remain robust, but cannot serve as a shield for speech that directly incites violence or systematically targets and harasses people; carefully tailored limits aimed at imminent or credible harm protect safety and civic participation. Complementary measures\u2014platform transparency, due process, public education, and restorative dialogue\u2014help address hateful ideas without needlessly chilling legitimate dissent.",
    "Honoring both liberty and dignity means upholding expansive rights to debate and dissent while narrowly prohibiting speech that constitutes true threats, imminent incitement, or persistent targeted harassment. Clear legal thresholds, accountable enforcement, and investments in counterspeech, education, and restorative remedies create space for open discourse while safeguarding vulnerable individuals and communities.",
    "A balanced approach defends vigorous free expression but recognizes narrow exceptions for direct, credible threats, imminent calls to violence, and coordinated harassment that cause real harm. Those exceptions should be defined precisely, applied with due process, and paired with education, community norms, and strong counterspeech to protect safety without stifling legitimate ideas.",
    "Free expression is essential to democratic life, but it should not shield direct threats, incitement to imminent violence, or sustained targeted harassment that make participation unsafe; narrowly defined legal limits focused on intent and clear harm are appropriate. Outside those strict boundaries, responses should prioritize due process, transparent rules, restorative practices, education, and vigorous counterspeech so that safety and dignity are protected without unduly silencing legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting broad free speech while preventing tangible harm can be achieved by drawing narrow, well-defined lines around true threats, calls to imminent violence, and coordinated harassment, enforced with due process and clear standards. For offensive but nonviolent views, societies should favor counterspeech, education, and restorative remedies that uphold dignity and maintain robust public debate.",
    "Free speech should be upheld as the engine of debate and creativity, yet limited where words intentionally and plausibly produce imminent harm\u2014such as credible threats, incitement to violence, or sustained targeted abuse\u2014with transparent, narrowly tailored laws and fair enforcement. Complementing legal limits with education, community norms, and vigorous counter-speech helps address root causes of hate without chilling legitimate dissent.",
    "Balancing liberty and safety means defending broad expressive freedom while narrowly prohibiting speech that intentionally incites violence, issues credible threats, or engages in persistent targeted harassment, applying clear legal thresholds and due process. Emphasis on restorative approaches, public education, and counterspeech preserves open inquiry and protects vulnerable people from real-world harm.",
    "A healthy public square protects robust, even uncomfortable, debate but does not tolerate speech that directly endangers others; narrowly targeted prohibitions on imminent incitement, true threats, and coordinated harassment\u2014paired with transparent rules, appeals, and community-driven education and restorative practices\u2014best reconcile free expression with the need to safeguard dignity and safety. This mix of legal precision and social remedies preserves democratic discourse while reducing harm.",
    "Free speech is foundational to democracy and social learning, but it should not become a license for direct threats, imminent incitement to violence, or coordinated, sustained harassment that makes people unsafe. Limits should be narrowly defined, enforced with clear standards and due process, and paired with education, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech so harm is prevented without needlessly chilling legitimate debate. By combining precise legal thresholds with community-based remedies and accountable platform policies, we can protect both open inquiry and the dignity of vulnerable people.",
    "Protecting open expression while preventing real harm requires a balanced approach: broadly defend nonviolent, unpopular ideas but prohibit direct threats, imminent calls to violence, and targeted, sustained harassment that deprives people of safety and equal participation. Any restrictions should be narrow, transparent, and subject to due process, alongside investment in education, counterspeech, and restorative responses that address root causes and repair harm. This mix preserves a vigorous marketplace of ideas while safeguarding vulnerable communities.",
    "Free expression must be upheld to allow dissent, art, and civic debate, yet narrowly tailored limits are justified where speech intentionally and plausibly produces imminent physical harm or constitutes true threats and organized harassment. Complement legal thresholds with clear platform policies, accountable enforcement, and community-centered education and restorative practices so safety and dignity are protected without sweeping censorship. Emphasizing precision, transparency, and dialogue builds common ground between liberty and protection.",
    "Open debate and the protection of human dignity can coexist if society confines limits to speech that directly incites imminent violence, issues credible threats, or engages in coordinated, sustained harassment, while responding to offensive but nonviolent speech through counterspeech, education, and restorative measures. Legal and platform rules should be narrowly drawn, evidence-based, and applied with due process and transparent appeal mechanisms. This approach defends both civic freedom and the safety of marginalized people.",
    "Freedom of expression is essential, yet it should not shield conduct that creates imminent danger\u2014credible threats, explicit calls to violence, or persistent targeted harassment warrant narrow, well-defined limits enforced with due process. Outside those boundaries, prioritize counterspeech, education, and restorative community practices to change hearts and rebuild trust, and require platforms and institutions to apply clear, accountable policies that balance openness with protection. Such precision and proportionality bridge concerns about censorship and safety.",
    "Free speech is essential to democratic life and cultural exchange, but it should not shield direct calls for violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that make participation unsafe. Limits should be narrowly defined, enforced with transparent standards and due process, while nonviolent hateful ideas are best countered through education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech. This balance protects both liberty and dignity without needlessly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting robust expression and protecting people from harm are complementary goals: narrow legal rules should forbid imminent incitement, true threats, and coordinated abuse, and institutions should apply those rules transparently and fairly. Outside those clear harms, emphasis should be on counter-speech, education, and community-led restorative responses that repair damage and reduce prejudice. Such an approach preserves open inquiry while safeguarding vulnerable members of society.",
    "Free expression must be broad enough to sustain dissent and art, yet it cannot be a license for targeted dehumanization, credible threats, or speech that foreseeably leads to violence. Carefully tailored prohibitions, clear definitions, and due process combined with platform accountability, public education, and restorative remedies offer a practical way to protect safety and dignity without sweeping censorship. This framework seeks common ground by prioritizing both open debate and vulnerable people\u2019s ability to participate equally.",
    "Democratic discourse requires vigorous speech, but words that directly incite harm or constitute sustained, targeted harassment should be subject to narrow, well\u2011defined limits and fair enforcement. For all other offensive or unpopular views, societies should rely on counterspeech, education, and restorative practices to change hearts and address grievances. Balancing precise legal constraints with community-based remedies helps preserve both liberty and social cohesion.",
    "Freedom of speech and the protection of human dignity can be reconciled by forbidding only speech that presents clear, imminent danger\u2014such as true threats, organized calls to violence, or persistent targeted harassment\u2014while protecting broad debate and dissent. Implementation should rest on narrow standards, transparent procedures, and investment in education, moderation, and restorative justice to heal harms and reduce prejudice. This pragmatic compromise defends open inquiry while ensuring safety and equal participation for all.",
    "Free speech is essential for democratic debate and cultural creativity, but it should not shield direct calls to violence, credible threats, or coordinated harassment that make people unsafe or exclude them from civic life. Limits should be narrowly defined, applied with clear standards and due process, and paired with education, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech so harms are addressed without needlessly silencing dissenting or unpopular ideas.",
    "Protecting open expression while safeguarding human dignity means narrowly restricting speech that intentionally incites imminent violence, issues true threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment, and otherwise favoring counterspeech, education, and community-based remedies. Clear legal thresholds, transparent enforcement, and avenues for appeal help reconcile free-speech principles with the need to prevent tangible harms to vulnerable people.",
    "Free expression should remain broad enough to allow dissent and creativity, yet constrained where words cross into imminent incitement, credible threats, or systematic dehumanization that produces real-world harm. Combining narrowly tailored legal limits with platform accountability, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech preserves debate while protecting safety and dignity.",
    "A balanced approach affirms that speech matters and should be defended, but not when it directly endangers others through calls for violence, targeted harassment, or credible threats; such harms warrant narrowly drawn, evidence-based limits enforced with due process. Outside those clear harms, responses should emphasize education, dialogue, and counterspeech to change attitudes without broad censorship.",
    "Societies should vigorously protect open debate while clearly limiting speech that intentionally and imminently incites violence, constitutes real threats, or organizes sustained harassment; those narrow limits must rest on transparent standards and fair procedures. Complementary investments in education, restorative justice, and counter-speech help heal harms and reduce the need for legal restriction, preserving space for robust but responsible expression.",
    "Free expression is essential to democracy and social progress, but it is not absolute: narrowly tailored, transparent limits are justified where speech intentionally and imminently incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or coordinates sustained harassment that deprives people of safety and equal participation. Those legal boundaries should be coupled with due process, clear definitions, and robust nonlegal responses\u2014education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech\u2014to address harmful attitudes without needlessly chilling legitimate debate. This balanced approach protects both civil liberties and human dignity while strengthening community resilience.",
    "Protecting free speech is vital for open debate, yet protecting vulnerable people and public safety requires narrow, well-defined prohibitions on true threats, imminent incitement to violence, and coordinated targeted harassment. Enforcement should be transparent, evidence-based, and accompanied by education, platform accountability, and restorative remedies so that harms are addressed without sweeping censorship. Centering both liberty and dignity creates practical, community-minded rules that preserve robust discourse while reducing real harm.",
    "Free speech should remain broad to allow dissent and creativity, but reasonable limits are appropriate when expression crosses into direct, imminent harm\u2014such as inciting violence, issuing credible threats, or engaging in sustained targeted abuse. Those limits must be narrowly drafted, applied with due process, and supplemented by public education, counterspeech, and restorative practices to heal communities and deter abuse without stifling legitimate disagreement. Combining precise legal standards with nonpunitive remedies preserves both safety and open inquiry.",
    "Safeguarding free expression is essential, yet speech that intentionally and imminently leads to violence, targets individuals with credible threats, or creates systematic harassment should not be protected. Limits should be narrowly tailored, transparently enforced, and paired with education, community norms, and robust counterspeech to address underlying prejudice and support those harmed. This dual strategy protects civic freedom while upholding public safety and human dignity.",
    "Free speech must be defended as the foundation of democratic life, but society can legitimately restrict narrowly defined harms\u2014true threats, imminent incitement to violence, and coordinated, sustained harassment\u2014that endanger people\u2019s safety and civic participation. Clear legal standards, due process, and accountable platform policies should be complemented by education, restorative justice, and counter-speech to reduce hate and repair harm without broadly chilling dissent. Striking this balance honors both liberty and the dignity of those at risk.",
    "Free expression is essential to democratic life and creative inquiry, but it should not be a shield for speech that directly incites violence, makes credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment; narrowly tailored legal limits focused on intent and imminent harm, applied with clear definitions and due process, protect safety without broadly chilling debate. Outside those narrow boundaries, emphasis should be placed on counterspeech, education, restorative practices, and transparent platform and community standards to repair harm and promote understanding while preserving robust, even uncomfortable, discourse.",
    "Protecting free speech is vital, yet speech that intentionally calls for or realistically risks imminent violence or persistently targets individuals to silence them should be subject to narrowly defined limits enforced with transparent procedures and due process. Complementing those legal guardrails with education, restorative accountability, and vigorous counter-speech preserves an open marketplace of ideas while safeguarding the dignity and safety of vulnerable people.",
    "Free speech should remain broad to foster debate and dissent, but reasonable, precisely drawn restrictions are justified when words amount to true threats, imminent incitement, or coordinated harassment that create real-world harm; such rules must be clear, narrowly tailored, and applied with oversight. For all other hateful or offensive expression, communities should rely on education, restorative responses, and robust counterspeech to address harms without resorting to sweeping censorship.",
    "Safeguarding free expression and protecting people from harm are complementary goals: law should narrowly prohibit direct, credible threats, imminent calls to violence, and systematic targeting that endangers participation in public life, while platforms, schools, and communities should deploy transparent moderation, restorative practices, and counter-speech to address broader hateful views. Emphasizing clarity, due process, and education reduces real harms without needlessly silencing unpopular but nonviolent ideas.",
    "Free speech is foundational, yet it must be balanced against the obligation to prevent direct harm; narrowly confined legal limits on incitement, true threats, and sustained targeted harassment\u2014paired with clear enforcement, appeals, and community-based remedies\u2014protect safety and dignity. Outside those narrow harms, the preferred responses are counterspeech, civic education, and restorative engagement that preserve debate while addressing prejudice and rebuilding trust.",
    "Free expression is essential to democratic life, but narrowly tailored limits are justified where speech directly and intentionally incites violence, issues credible threats, or engages in targeted, sustained harassment that makes participation unsafe.

    "Protecting free speech and protecting community safety are both vital, so limits should be narrowly drawn to cover only true threats, imminent calls to violence, and coordinated harassment, while leaving broad leeway for controversial or offensive ideas. Complementary measures like platform accountability, transparent appeals, civic education, and restorative dialogue reduce harm without rewarding censorship.",
    "Free speech should remain broad to foster creativity and critique, yet words that foreseeably and deliberately cause physical harm or systematically silence others through threats or organized abuse warrant restriction. Those restrictions must rest on precise, evidence-based thresholds, independent oversight, and an emphasis on counterspeech, support for affected communities, and learning-based remedies to prevent chilling legitimate expression.",
    "Balancing liberty and dignity means criminalizing only narrow harms\u2014direct incitement of imminent violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment\u2014and prioritizing noncriminal responses such as education, workplace and platform policies, and restorative justice for other hateful but nonviolent speech. Transparent rules, due process, and community-led solutions help protect safety and inclusion while preserving a vigorous marketplace of ideas.",
    "Free speech should be robust, but not a shield for conduct that endangers others; narrowly defined prohibitions on true threats, imminent incitement, and coordinated harassment, enforced with clear procedures and appeals, can protect safety and equal participation. Alongside limited legal limits, investment in counterspeech, civic education, and restorative practices builds resilience and reduces harm without unduly chilling dissent.",
    "Free expression is essential to democratic life and cultural exchange, but it should not shield direct threats, intentional incitement to imminent violence, or sustained targeted harassment that deprives people of safety and equal participation. Limits should be narrowly defined, context-sensitive, and enforced with transparent standards and due process, while nonviolent hateful views are addressed through education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech to preserve robust debate and protect dignity.",
    "Protecting open debate and dissent is crucial, yet speech that deliberately aims to cause immediate physical harm or systematically silences people through credible threats or coordinated harassment warrants narrowly tailored legal limits. Complementary measures\u2014clear platform policies, transparent enforcement, education, and restorative community responses\u2014can reduce harm without needlessly chilling legitimate expression.",
    "Free speech should remain broad to allow contestation of ideas, but it does not extend to true threats, calls for imminent violence, or persistent targeted abuse that endangers individuals or groups. A balanced approach relies on precise legal thresholds, due process, and proportionate enforcement alongside investments in counterspeech, civic education, and restorative remedies to protect vulnerable people while preserving civic discourse.",
    "Democratic openness requires strong protections for expression, yet society has a duty to limit speech that intentionally incites imminent violence, communicates credible threats, or organizes sustained harassment that undermines participation and safety. Narrow, well-defined restrictions paired with transparent oversight, appeals, and nonpunitive responses like education and community dialogue can uphold both liberty and human dignity.",
    "Freedom of expression should be defended as the engine of debate and accountability, but narrowly tailored limits are justified for speech that poses clear, imminent danger\u2014such as direct incitement, credible threats, or coordinated harassment\u2014while preserving space for uncomfortable but nonviolent ideas. Emphasizing precise law, due process, platform responsibility, counterspeech, and restorative practices offers a practical path to protect safety and dignity without broad censorship.",

    "Protecting free speech while safeguarding dignity means allowing broad, even uncomfortable debate but drawing clear, narrow lines against true threats, incitement to imminent violence, and coordinated harassment. Legal and platform rules should use precise tests, independent oversight, and appeals, while noncriminal harms are best met with education, counterspeech, and restorative practices that heal and reduce prejudice.",
    "Free speech must be preserved as the engine of democratic and cultural life, yet it cannot be a shield for speech that imminently endangers others through threats, incitement, or repeated targeted abuse. Limits should be tightly tailored and enforced with due process, and responses beyond law\u2014such as community norms, school and workplace policies, and public counternarratives\u2014should promote safety and reconciliation without unnecessary censorship.",
    "Balancing liberty and safety requires defending open inquiry while prohibiting narrowly defined harms: credible threats, calls for imminent violence, and sustained targeted harassment that silence or endanger people. Clear legal thresholds, transparent enforcement, and investments in education, restorative justice, and vigorous counter-speech create a practical middle ground that protects vulnerable communities and preserves robust public debate.",
    "Free expression should be broad enough to allow dissent and cultural exchange but must be accountable when it crosses into imminent incitement, true threats, or coordinated harassment that deprives others of safety or equal participation. Narrow, well-defined limits with procedural safeguards, together with platform accountability, public education, and restorative remedies, strike a balance between protecting civil liberties and preventing real harm.",
    "Free speech is essential for democracy and cultural life, but it must coexist with protections against direct threats, imminent incitement, and sustained targeted harassment that endanger people's safety and dignity.

    "Free expression is foundational to democracy, yet narrowly defined limits on direct incitement to imminent violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment are justified to protect safety and dignity. Those limits should rest on clear legal standards, transparent enforcement with due process, and be paired with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech so open debate is preserved while harms are prevented.",
    "Protecting free speech and protecting people from harm are complementary goals: laws and platform rules should only prohibit speech that intends and is likely to cause imminent physical harm, constitutes true threats, or organizes coordinated harassment. Outside those narrow, evidence-based boundaries, society should rely on counterspeech, education, and community norms to address offensive or dehumanizing ideas without broad censorship.",
    "Free speech should be broadly defended, but not as a license for targeted violence or systematic harassment; narrow, objective thresholds centered on intent, imminence, and demonstrable harm should determine limits. Enforcement must be transparent, legally grounded, and accompanied by investments in civic education, mental-health supports, and restorative remedies that reduce the drivers of hate while preserving sincere dissent.",
    "A practical balance honors both liberty and dignity: prohibit direct calls for imminent violence, credible threats, and persistent targeted abuse, while protecting controversial or unpopular ideas that do not pose clear harm. Policies and moderation should use precise definitions, independent oversight, and proportionate, restorative responses\u2014favoring counterspeech and education wherever possible to keep public debate robust.",
    "Narrowly tailored prohibitions on speech that directly causes or imminently risks physical harm, credible threats, or coordinated harassment can coexist with robust protections for dissent and artistic expression. Clear rules, due process, transparent platform practices, and investment in counterspeech and restorative community processes create a durable compromise that protects vulnerable people without needlessly chilling open inquiry.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected to preserve open debate, artistic expression, and dissent, while narrowly limiting speech that intentionally and imminently incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or coordinates sustained targeted harassment. Those limits must be precisely defined, applied with due process and transparency, and complemented by education, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech to address harmful attitudes without chilling legitimate discourse.",
    "Protecting freedom of expression and protecting people from direct harm are both essential: narrow, clearly defined legal and platform rules should prohibit true threats, imminent incitement, and organized harassment, but not punish offensive or unpopular ideas. Enforcement should emphasize clear standards, impartial due process, and nonlegal remedies\u2014such as education, community norms, and counterspeech\u2014to heal harm and preserve democratic debate.",
    "A balanced approach defends wide latitude for expression while targeting only speech that produces imminent, demonstrable harm\u2014direct calls to violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment. Clear, narrowly tailored rules enforced with transparency and appeals, together with investment in education, restorative accountability, and vigorous counterspeech, best protect both civil liberties and the dignity of vulnerable people.",
    "Freedom to speak and the duty to keep communities safe can be reconciled by narrowly restricting direct incitement, true threats, and coordinated harassment and by otherwise privileging counterspeech, education, and community-led remedies. Any restriction should be governed by precise definitions, transparent enforcement, and due process so that safety is secured without needless censorship of dissenting or artistic voices.",
    "Democratic life requires robust free expression alongside protections for those threatened by hateful conduct: laws and platform policies should forbid imminent incitement, credible threats, and targeted doxxing or sustained abuse, while leaving space for contentious but nonviolent ideas. Complementary measures\u2014clear rules, fair procedures, public education, and restorative practices\u2014can reduce harm and foster more inclusive public discourse."
