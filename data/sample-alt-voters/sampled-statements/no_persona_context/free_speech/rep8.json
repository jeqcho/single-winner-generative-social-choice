    "Free expression is vital to democracy and should be broadly protected, but narrowly defined limits are justified when speech directly and imminently threatens safety, incites violence, or constitutes sustained targeted harassment; such limits must be precise, legally clear, and enforced with due process. Outside those narrow boundaries, hateful or offensive ideas are best countered through education, restorative practices, and robust counter\u2011speech so that open debate and the dignity of vulnerable people are both preserved.",
    "Protecting open inquiry and dissent is essential, yet society can reasonably prohibit speech that intentionally incites imminent lawless action, makes credible threats, or organizes coordinated harassment that silences others. Any restriction should be narrowly tailored, transparent, and paired with education, platform accountability, and restorative responses to address harm without unduly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Free speech should remain the default in a democratic society, while narrowly targeted legal limits can prevent direct, demonstrable harms such as true threats, imminent calls for violence, and systematic doxxing or harassment; these limits require clear standards, oversight, and proportional remedies. Complementary tools\u2014civic education, counterspeech, and community\u2011led restorative practices\u2014can reduce hateful rhetoric and protect dignity without resorting to broad censorship.",
    "Upholding robust free expression and protecting individuals from harm are both important goals: reasonable, precisely defined limits on speech that poses imminent danger or persistent, targeted abuse should be enforceable under fair procedures. For other hateful or offensive speech, priority should go to noncriminal remedies\u2014education, dialogue, and counter\u2011speech\u2014to preserve a lively marketplace of ideas while safeguarding vulnerable communities.",
    "Freedom of expression should be strongly defended, but it need not shelter direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or coordinated harassment that endangers people; limits addressing those concrete harms should be narrow, evidence\u2011based, and applied with due process. Alongside narrow legal constraints, investment in education, restorative justice, and transparent platform policies can reduce harm and maintain open, inclusive public discourse.",
    "Free expression should be robustly protected as the foundation of democratic life, while narrowly and clearly restricting speech that directly and imminently threatens safety\u2014such as credible threats, calls for violence, or coordinated targeted harassment. Limits must be precisely defined, applied with due process, and paired with non\u2011criminal responses like education, restorative practices, and counterspeech so that protecting dignity and public safety does not unduly chill legitimate debate. By emphasizing transparency, proportionality, and community remedies, society can safeguard both liberty and the wellbeing of vulnerable people.",
    "Protecting free speech and protecting people from real harm are compatible goals: expression should remain broad, but narrowly tailored legal prohibitions are justified for direct incitement, credible threats, or sustained harassment that pose imminent danger. Any restriction should be clearly defined, subject to oversight and due process, and complemented by education, platform accountability, and restorative community measures to address prejudice without sweeping censorship. This balanced approach preserves open debate while defending safety and dignity.",
    "Free speech must be defended as essential to public life, yet society should draw clear, narrow lines against speech that predictably causes imminent harm\u2014such as true threats, calls for violence, or organized harassment\u2014while protecting offensive but non\u2011violent ideas. Rules limiting harm should be transparent, narrowly targeted, and enforced with procedural safeguards, and supplemented by counterspeech, education, and restorative remedies that repair harms and foster inclusion. Such a framework preserves robust discourse while protecting vulnerable people and public safety.",
    "Open debate and individual liberty should be preserved, but they do not extend to speech that intentionally incites imminent lawless action, issues credible threats, or conducts targeted campaigns to silence or endanger people. Limits must be precise, proportionate, and applied through fair procedures, and society should prioritize non\u2011criminal solutions\u2014education, community norms, and counter\u2011speech\u2014to reduce harm and rebuild trust. A principled mix of narrow legal safeguards and civic remedies can bridge concerns about censorship and safety.",
    "Freedom of expression is vital, yet reasonable, narrowly defined restrictions on direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and persistent targeted harassment are defensible to protect safety and dignity. Any such limits should be transparent, grounded in evidence of imminent harm, and coupled with due process, education, and restorative responses so that the remedy fits the harm and open discourse remains intact. Emphasizing proportionality and community\u2011based solutions helps reconcile free\u2011speech values with protections for vulnerable people.",
    "Free expression is essential for democratic life and cultural creativity, but it must be balanced with narrowly tailored protections against speech that directly threatens safety or intentionally incites imminent violence or coordinated harassment. Limits should be clear, proportionate, and applied with due process, while nonlegal tools\u2014education, restorative practices, counterspeech, and transparent platform policies\u2014should address offensive but non-violent ideas and support the dignity of vulnerable people.",
    "Protecting free speech while preventing real harm requires a principled middle ground: robust defenses for controversial and unpopular ideas combined with narrowly defined prohibitions on true threats, imminent calls to violence, and sustained targeted harassment. Emphasizing precise legal standards, fair enforcement, and investments in education, community norms, and restorative remedies can reduce harm without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Free speech should remain broad enough to foster debate and dissent, yet not serve as cover for direct incitement, credible threats, or organized harassment that endanger people\u2019s safety and dignity. Any restrictions must be tightly limited, transparent, and subject to due process, with a preference for counterspeech, education, and community-based responses to heal harm and preserve open discourse.",
    "Upholding free expression and protecting individuals from harm are complementary goals: defend wide latitude for ideas while narrowly prohibiting speech that poses a clear, imminent risk of violence or systematically targets and silences others. Complementary approaches\u2014clear legal definitions, procedural safeguards, platform accountability, restorative practices, and public education\u2014can protect vulnerable people without resorting to broad censorship.",
    "A balanced approach honors free speech as vital to democracy while recognizing the need for precise limits on speech that directly incites violence, issues true threats, or engages in coordinated harassment. By enforcing narrow, well-defined rules with due process and prioritizing education, counterspeech, and restorative community measures, society can protect safety and dignity without unduly restricting open debate.",
    "Free speech should be robustly protected as the engine of democratic debate, while narrowly targeted limits are defensible when speech directly and imminently incites violence, makes credible threats, or coordinates sustained harassment that endangers people. Those limits must be clearly defined, applied with due process and transparency, and accompanied by non\u2011legal responses\u2014education, counterspeech, restorative practices, and fair platform rules\u2014to address harmful rhetoric without chilling legitimate disagreement.",
    "Safeguarding open expression and protecting human dignity are compatible goals: prohibit only speech that poses a clear, imminent risk of harm\u2014true threats, direct calls for violence, or organized harassment\u2014while preserving space for controversial but non\u2011violent ideas. Legal restrictions should be narrow, evidence\u2011based, and subject to oversight, and communities and platforms should emphasize education, counterspeech, and restorative accountability to reduce harm and strengthen civic discourse.",
    "Free speech merits strong protection, yet society may limit expression narrowly when it crosses into conduct\u2014imminent incitement, credible threats, or targeted doxxing\u2014that predictably causes real harm. Clear legal standards, due process, and proportional remedies should be paired with education, platform transparency, and robust counterspeech to address hateful ideas without suppressing legitimate debate.",
    "Defend broad free expression while drawing precise lines against speech that directly harms others: criminalize imminent incitement, true threats, and coordinated harassment, but avoid vague, viewpoint\u2011based bans that chill dissent. Implement narrowly tailored laws with judicial oversight and predictable enforcement, and complement legal limits with community norms, restorative practices, educational efforts, and platform accountability so public safety and open debate reinforce\u2014not undermine\u2014each other.",
    "Free speech and safety can be balanced by protecting the exchange of ideas while narrowly restricting speech that clearly threatens violence, constitutes credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment. Such restrictions must be precise, transparent, and subject to due process, with greater reliance on counterspeech, education, and restorative remedies to heal harm and preserve a resilient public sphere.",
    "Free expression is essential to democratic life, but it should not shield direct threats, credible incitement to imminent violence, or sustained targeted harassment that causes real harm. Limits should therefore be narrowly defined, applied with clear legal standards and due process, while nonlegal tools\u2014education, counter-speech, restorative practices, and transparent platform policies\u2014address offensive but nonviolent ideas.",
    "Protecting free speech and protecting people\u2019s safety are both public goods that can be reconciled. Law should forbid only narrowly tailored harms\u2014true threats, imminent calls for violence, and coordinated harassment\u2014while avoiding broad content bans. Communities, platforms, and schools should prioritize counterspeech, education, and restorative remedies to reduce harm without needlessly chilling debate.",
    "Free speech should remain robust to support debate and creativity, yet narrowly targeted restrictions are justified where speech predictably and imminently causes physical harm, issues credible threats, or systematically silences marginalized people. Any limit must be precise, transparently enforced with due process, and complemented by education, civic norms, and accessible redress.",
    "A balanced approach defends wide latitude for controversial and unpopular ideas while drawing clear, objective lines against speech that incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or engages in sustained dehumanizing harassment. Legal restrictions should be rare, narrowly tailored, and subject to judicial oversight; social remedies\u2014counterspeech, community standards, and restorative practices\u2014should be the first line for addressing hateful but nonviolent expression. Together these measures protect both liberty and dignity.",
    "Society should vigorously protect open discussion but not allow speech that directly calls for violence, threatens safety, or organizes targeted campaigns to silence or harm people. Narrow, well-defined legal prohibitions plus education, transparent platform rules, and restorative community responses offer a principled path that minimizes harm while preserving robust public debate.",
    "Free expression is essential to democracy and should be broadly protected, while narrowly and clearly limiting speech that directly threatens, credibly incites imminent violence, or engages in sustained targeted harassment. Any restrictions must be precisely defined, enforced with due process, and paired with education, restorative practices, and robust counter-speech to reduce harm without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "A principled approach defends open debate and unpopular ideas, yet draws precise legal and social lines against speech that poses a clear, imminent risk\u2014such as true threats, coordinated doxxing, or calls for violence. Emphasizing transparent standards, fair enforcement, and non\u2011criminal remedies like education and counterspeech helps protect dignity while minimizing government overreach.",
    "Societies should preserve vigorous free speech while recognizing that targeted incitement, credible threats, and coordinated harassment that endanger individuals warrant narrow, evidence\u2011based limits. Those limits should be applied transparently with due process and complemented by community norms, platform accountability, and investments in education and restorative justice to heal harm and sustain open discourse.",
    "Free speech must be upheld as the foundation of democratic life, but it cannot be an absolute shelter for words that directly incite imminent lawless action or repeatedly aim to silence and harm specific people. Balancing narrowly tailored prohibitions with clear definitions, judicial oversight, and vigorous counter-speech and education can protect both liberty and the dignity of vulnerable communities.",
    "Protecting the marketplace of ideas requires robust safeguards for expression alongside narrowly targeted prohibitions on direct threats, credible calls to violence, and persistent harassment that creates imminent harm. Enforcing those limits through precise law, fair procedures, and restorative, educational, and platform-based responses offers common ground between free-speech advocates and those seeking protection from hate.",
    "Free expression is essential for democratic life and open inquiry, yet reasonable, narrowly tailored limits are justified to prevent direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment that endangers people\u2019s safety and dignity. Those limits should be precisely defined, applied with due process, and complemented by education, restorative practices, and robust counter-speech so that harmful conduct is prevented without unduly chilling legitimate debate. By combining clear legal standards with community-led remedies and platform transparency, society can protect both liberty and vulnerable members of the public.",
    "Protecting free speech while preventing harm means drawing narrow, well-defined lines around true threats, imminent calls to violence, and coordinated harassment, enforced through fair procedures and transparent rules. Outside those narrow boundaries, offensive or unpopular ideas should be countered with education, counterspeech, and restorative measures rather than broad censorship, preserving a vigorous public square that respects human dignity and public safety.",
    "Free speech should be broadly safeguarded as the engine of debate and creativity, but it cannot serve as a shield for speech that predictably leads to violence or systematically silences and harms targeted groups; narrowly tailored legal prohibitions on incitement, threats, and doxxing are therefore defensible. Complementary investments in civic education, platform accountability, and restorative community responses can reduce harm while keeping space for difficult but legitimate discourse.",
    "Balancing liberty and safety requires protecting the broad right to speak while imposing precise, limited restrictions on direct incitement, credible threats, and persistent targeted harassment that create imminent risk. Those restrictions must be subject to strict legal standards and oversight and paired with nonlegal tools\u2014education, counterspeech, and restorative justice\u2014to address prejudice without suppressing honest disagreement.",
    "Free expression should be robustly defended, yet society should refuse to tolerate speech that intentionally incites violence, issues true threats, or coordinates sustained harassment; narrow, transparent prohibitions on such conduct, enforced with due process, can protect safety and dignity. Alongside legal safeguards, community norms, educational efforts, and platform policies should promote accountability and counter harmful rhetoric while preserving a lively marketplace of ideas.",
    "Free expression is foundational to a democratic society and should be broadly protected, yet narrowly tailored limits are justified where speech directly and imminently threatens safety\u2014such as true threats, incitement to violence, or coordinated harassment. Those limits must be precise, enforced with due process, and paired with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech to address hateful ideas without unduly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting free speech while safeguarding dignity and safety requires balancing robust protections for controversial but nonviolent ideas with transparent, narrow prohibitions on direct incitement, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment. Clear legal definitions, judicial oversight, platform accountability, and community-led education and restorative remedies can reduce harm without resorting to sweeping censorship.",
    "Free speech should remain the space for dissent, art, and inquiry, but it should not shield expressions that predictably produce imminent harm; narrowly defined bans on calls to violence, true threats, and organized harassment are defensible. Combining precise legal standards and due process with counterspeech, education, and restorative community responses protects vulnerable people while keeping open discourse vibrant.",
    "A workable middle ground honors broad free-expression rights while recognizing that the state and institutions should act when speech crosses into imminent lawless action, credible threats, or coordinated harassment that silences others. Transparent rules, narrow definitions, proportional remedies, and investment in education and counter-speech help preserve both liberty and human dignity.",
    "Free expression should be vigorously defended as essential to democratic life, yet narrowly tailored limits are appropriate to prevent direct, imminent harms such as incitement, credible threats, and targeted doxxing or sustained harassment. Any such limits must be precise, consistently applied with due process, and reinforced by education, restorative practices, and strong counterspeech so safety and open debate reinforce one another.",
    "Free expression should be vigorously protected as the foundation of open debate, while narrowly and clearly prohibiting speech that directly incites imminent violence, makes credible threats, or engages in coordinated, targeted harassment that endangers people. Any limits ought to be precisely defined, applied with due process and oversight, and complemented by education, counterspeech, restorative practices, and transparent platform policies to reduce harm without unduly chilling legitimate dissent.",
    "Robust free speech is essential, but society can agree on narrowly tailored boundaries against direct calls for violence, true threats, and sustained targeted harassment that silence or harm others. Those boundaries should rest on clear legal standards, fair enforcement, and non\u2011criminal remedies like education, community accountability, and counter\u2011speech to preserve open debate while protecting dignity and safety.",
    "Protecting free expression and protecting people are complementary goals: speech should remain broadly free, yet limited where it creates an imminent risk of physical harm or is used to terrorize or systematically dehumanize specific individuals or groups. Practical safeguards\u2014narrow laws, due process, platform transparency, and investment in education and restorative responses\u2014can prevent real harms while keeping space for unpopular but non\u2011violent ideas.",
    "Free speech must be preserved as the engine of democratic life, but reasonable, narrowly defined limits are justified when speech predictably produces imminent violence, credible threats, or targeted campaigns of harassment. Clear definitions, judicial oversight, and a preference for counterspeech, civil remedies, and community\u2011based restorative measures help balance liberty with the need to protect vulnerable people and public safety.",
    "Upholding open discourse requires both strong protections for expression and precise, limited rules against speech that directly incites harm or persistently targets and endangers others; vague or broad bans should be avoided. Combining narrowly tailored legal prohibitions with transparent enforcement, education, platform policies, and restorative practices offers a balanced path that defends free debate while reducing the real harms of hate\u2011driven conduct.",
    "Free expression is fundamental to democratic life, but it should not shield direct threats, credible incitement to imminent violence, or sustained targeted harassment that endangers people. Any limits should be narrowly defined, applied with clear legal standards and due process, and paired with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter-speech to address hateful ideas without silencing legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting free speech is essential, while recognizing narrowly tailored limits are justified to stop direct incitement, true threats, and coordinated harassment that cause real harm. Clear rules, consistent due process, and non\u2011criminal responses like education, counterspeech, and restorative accountability help defend dignity and safety without broad censorship.",
    "A society can both defend robust debate and protect vulnerable people by prohibiting only speech that directly and imminently threatens harm\u2014such as calls for violence, credible threats, or organized harassment\u2014while preserving space for offensive but non\u2011violent views. Transparent legal standards, fair enforcement, and community measures like education and restorative dialogue offer balanced tools to reduce harm and sustain open discourse.",
    "Free speech must be upheld as the engine of inquiry and dissent, yet limited narrowly where speech predictably causes imminent physical harm or constitutes targeted, sustained harassment. Complementing precise legal prohibitions with due process, counterspeech, education, and restorative remedies achieves a practical balance between liberty and community safety.",
    "Upholding free expression and protecting people from tangible harm are both vital: restrict only direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and systematic harassment that creates imminent danger, and do so through narrowly tailored laws and due process. Reinforcing those limits with education, counter\u2011speech, and restorative practices preserves open debate while safeguarding dignity and safety.",
    "Free expression is essential to democracy and should be broadly protected as the space for dissent, art, and debate; however, narrow, clearly defined limits are justified to prevent direct threats, imminent incitement, and targeted harassment. Those limits must be enforced with due process and paired with education, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech so harm is reduced without unduly chilling legitimate discourse.",
    "A principled balance recognizes that free speech underpins open debate while also permitting restrictions on speech that directly incites violence, issues credible threats, or coordinates sustained harassment. Such limits should be precise, transparent, and subject to oversight, and outside those narrow harms priority should be given to counterspeech, education, and restorative remedies rather than broad censorship.",
    "Protecting free expression need not mean tolerating words that create an imminent risk of harm; narrow prohibitions on true threats, imminent lawless action, and deliberate doxxing can safeguard safety and dignity. Enforcement should focus on conduct and likely harm, rely on clear definitions and due process, and be complemented by platform transparency and community-based responses.",
    "Free speech must be preserved as the forum for contesting ideas, yet speech that predictably produces violence or systematically silences people warrants targeted restriction. Policy should center on demonstrable harm, not viewpoint, with transparent rules and judicial oversight while investing in public education, counterspeech, and support for those harmed.",
    "Robust freedom of expression fosters learning and democratic life, but it is not absolute when speech crosses into credible threats, imminent incitement, or sustained targeted harassment; narrowly tailored, evidence\u2011based limits can address those harms. Those limits should be applied through transparent legal processes with safeguards against abuse, and complemented by platform accountability, restorative practices, and promotion of counter-speech to protect both liberty and the dignity and safety of vulnerable people.",

Clear definitions, narrow enforcement, and transparent remedies ensure both liberty and safety.",
    "Free speech is vital, but it does not absolve speech that poses clear, immediate risk of harm; narrowly tailored laws against incitement, true threats, and doxxing should be paired with platform standards, restorative practices, and public education to reduce harm and heal communities. Enforcement must be impartial, precise, and subject to oversight so that protections do not become tools for political suppression. Prioritizing counter-speech and civic dialogue preserves a robust marketplace of ideas while safeguarding vulnerable individuals from tangible danger.",
    "Uphold wide-ranging protections for expression while drawing narrow, well-defined lines around speech that directly incites violence, makes credible threats, or engages in organized harassment that silences others.

Outside those narrow boundaries, society should rely on education, community norms, platform policies, and counter-speech to confront hateful ideas.",
    "A balanced approach recognizes free speech as essential but not absolute: speech that predictably causes imminent physical harm or seeks to silence and terrorize individuals merits narrow legal restriction. Emphasis should be placed on narrowly tailored laws, due process, and non\u2011criminal responses\u2014education, restorative dialogue, and counterspeech\u2014to preserve open debate and protect vulnerable people.",
    "Common ground is found in protecting the marketplace of ideas while drawing firm, narrowly targeted lines against speech that constitutes direct threats, incitement of imminent lawless action, or persistent targeted harassment. Any restriction should be transparent, proportionate, and subject to oversight to avoid political misuse. Reinforcing civic education, restorative remedies, and platform accountability offers humane tools to reduce harm without stifling legitimate dissent.",

    "Open expression and human dignity are both essential, so rules should forbid only narrowly specified conduct\u2014such as calls for imminent lawless action, true threats, and coordinated doxxing\u2014while relying on counterspeech, education, and proportional remedies to address offensive but nonviolent ideas. Transparent application and due process can prevent abuse of restrictions and help maintain public safety without broad censorship.",
    "A practical compromise is to uphold wide latitude for debate while imposing narrowly tailored, legally precise limits on speech that directly incites violence or targets individuals with credible threats and sustained harassment; elsewhere, promote education, restorative practices, and counter\u2011speech to address prejudice. This approach protects vulnerable people and public safety while minimizing government overreach and preserving robust civic discourse.",

Emphasizing clear laws, fair procedures, platform accountability, and investment in education, mental\u2011health supports, and counter-speech can reduce harm without needlessly censoring dissent.",
    "A balanced approach defends free expression while recognizing that words crossing into true threats, imminent incitement, or sustained targeted harassment create real harms that merit limited legal restriction. Prioritizing narrowly framed prohibitions, consistent due process, and complementary responses\u2014education, restorative justice, and vigorous counter-speech\u2014builds public safety and protects vulnerable communities without eroding the marketplace of ideas.",
    "Free speech should be vigorous but not absolute: direct calls for violence, credible threats, and coordinated harassment that foreseeably endanger people can be lawfully limited if restrictions are narrowly tailored, clearly defined, and subject to oversight. Where speech is offensive but non\u2011violent, prefer counterspeech, civic education, and community-led restorative measures to repair harm while keeping civic discourse open.",
    "Upholding liberty and protecting dignity are compatible goals when limits on expression are confined to conduct that creates imminent, demonstrable harm\u2014true threats, incitement to violence, and targeted doxxing or harassment\u2014enforced transparently with due process. Complementary social tools like education, platform governance, and restorative practices should address the wider harms of hateful rhetoric without resorting to broad censorship of controversial ideas.",
    "Free expression is essential to democratic life and should be broadly protected, but narrowly tailored limits are justified where speech directly and imminently incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or engages in targeted harassment that causes real harm. Any restrictions should be clearly defined, subject to due process, and designed to avoid chilling legitimate debate. Complementary measures\u2014education, restorative practices, community norms, and counter-speech\u2014should be prioritized to reduce harm while preserving open discourse.",
    "Protecting free speech while safeguarding people from harm requires a balance: robust protections for unpopular or controversial ideas alongside narrow, precise prohibitions on direct incitement, credible threats, and coordinated harassment. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement, and nonlegal responses such as education and counterspeech can prevent abuse without enabling broad censorship.",
    "A principled approach defends open debate and the free exchange of ideas while recognizing that speech crossing into imminent violence, true threats, or sustained targeted harassment undermines safety and dignity and may be lawfully curtailed. Limits must be narrowly drawn, evidence\u2011based, and enforced with due process to prevent political misuse. Platforms and institutions should pair those legal guardrails with education, restorative remedies, and active counterspeech to heal harms and build resilience. This combination protects vulnerable people and preserves a vibrant public sphere.",
    "Free speech should be vigorously protected as the foundation of democratic discourse, but it is reasonable to prohibit speech that poses a clear, imminent risk of harm\u2014such as direct calls for violence, credible threats, or doxxing used to harass. Any restriction must be precise, transparent, and coupled with remedies like education, community accountability, and counterspeech to address prejudice and misinformation. This calibrated mix helps safeguard dignity and safety without silencing legitimate disagreement.",
    "Society should uphold broad free\u2011expression rights while recognizing a narrow carve\u2011out for speech that intentionally and imminently threatens physical safety or systematically silences people through harassment. Legal limits must be precise, proportionate, and subject to oversight, and should be complemented by education, restorative practices, and strong community and platform norms. Together these tools can protect vulnerable communities and sustain robust, open debate."
