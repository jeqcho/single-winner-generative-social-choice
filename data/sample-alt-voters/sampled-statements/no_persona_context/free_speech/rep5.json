    "Free speech should be broadly protected to preserve open debate and the exchange of ideas, while narrowly limited only where speech poses a clear, imminent risk\u2014such as direct threats, incitement to violence, or targeted, sustained harassment that undermines safety and dignity. These legal limits must be precisely defined, applied with due process, and paired with education, counterspeech, and restorative community responses so harm is addressed without chilling legitimate expression.",
    "Societies can defend robust expression while drawing narrowly tailored lines against speech that directly calls for or imminently causes harm, including credible threats and coordinated harassment; outside those defined harms, offensive or unpopular ideas should be countered through education, platform norms, and vigorous counterspeech. Clear standards, transparent enforcement, and restorative practices help protect vulnerable people and preserve open civic discourse.",
    "Preserving a free marketplace of ideas requires strong protections for nonviolent expression, but reasonable, narrowly focused restrictions are justified when speech intentionally incites violence, issues true threats, or systematically silences and endangers others. Coupling precise legal limits with due process, community-led education, and proportionate platform or institutional policies balances liberty with the responsibility to protect safety and dignity.",
    "Free speech and public safety are compatible when boundaries target conduct\u2014not opinion\u2014prohibiting direct threats, imminent incitement, and persistent targeted harassment while leaving room for contentious debate and satire. Complementary measures like counterspeech, education, transparent moderation, and restorative accountability address harm without resorting to broad censorship.",
    "Respecting both liberty and human dignity means defending broad expressive freedoms but enforcing narrow, well-defined prohibitions on speech that foreseeably produces immediate harm\u2014such as true threats, clear incitement to violence, or coordinated harassment\u2014implemented with due process and transparency. Emphasizing education, community dialogue, and proportional remedies helps heal harm and sustain inclusive public discourse.",
    "Free speech is essential to democratic life, but it should not shield direct threats, clear incitement to imminent violence, or sustained targeted harassment that endangers people. Limits must be narrowly and transparently defined, enforced with due process, and paired with education, counterspeech, and restorative community measures so that safety and dignity are protected without needlessly silencing legitimate debate.",
    "Open debate and the exchange of ideas should be vigorously protected while drawing narrow, well-defined lines against speech that intentionally incites violence, constitutes true threats, or systematically targets and silences vulnerable people. Combining precise legal standards and fair enforcement with robust education, platform accountability, and restorative practices helps prevent harm while preserving a vibrant public square.",
    "Safeguarding free expression requires balancing the right to speak with the responsibility to prevent foreseeable, imminent harm: prohibit direct threats, coordinated calls to violence, and sustained harassment, but avoid vague bans that chill dissent. Complementing narrowly tailored legal limits with counterspeech, community dialogue, and clear institutional policies creates space for both safety and robust disagreement.",
    "Freedom of speech should remain broad enough to foster creativity and accountability while excluding narrowly specified conduct\u2014such as true threats, incitement to imminent lawless action, and targeted harassment\u2014that directly undermines safety and dignity. Emphasizing transparent rules, due process, and nonlegal tools like education, restorative justice, and vigorous counter-speech strikes a pragmatic compromise between liberty and protection.",
    "Protecting both open discourse and vulnerable people means permitting robust, even uncomfortable ideas while restricting speech that is intended and likely to produce immediate harm through threats, violence, or persistent dehumanization. Clear, narrowly tailored legal standards enforced with procedural safeguards, together with public education and community-led responses, can reduce real-world harms without silencing legitimate debate.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected to preserve open debate and the exchange of ideas, but narrowly tailored limits are justified when speech intentionally and imminently threatens safety\u2014such as direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment. Those limits must be clearly defined, applied with due process, and balanced by non\u2011legal tools like counterspeech, education, restorative practices, and accountable platform or institutional policies to repair harm without chilling legitimate expression.",
    "Defending robust free expression and protecting vulnerable people are compatible goals when laws restrict only speech that poses a clear, immediate risk\u2014true threats, calls for imminent lawless action, or coordinated harassment\u2014while preserving room for unpopular or offensive ideas. Complementary responses such as education, community dialogue, transparent moderation, and restorative remedies can reduce harm and strengthen civic trust without resorting to broad censorship.",
    "Free speech is essential to democratic life, yet society should draw narrow, precise lines against speech that foreseeably and imminently causes physical harm or systematically silences or harasses individuals. Enforcing those limits through transparent standards and due process, while prioritizing counterspeech, education, and restorative accountability, balances liberty with safety and dignity.",
    "Preserving open discourse requires strong protection for expression alongside narrowly defined prohibitions on direct threats, clear incitement to imminent violence, and sustained targeted harassment that endangers people. Coupling legally precise limits with community-led education, platform accountability, and restorative practices offers a pragmatic way to reduce real\u2011world harm without unduly stifling debate.",
    "Upholding free speech and protecting individuals from harm can be reconciled by restricting only speech that intentionally produces imminent danger\u2014true threats, calls for immediate violence, or prolonged targeted harassment\u2014while defending broad protections for dissenting or uncomfortable views. Transparent rules, due process, and emphasis on counterspeech, education, and restorative remedies ensure both safety and a vibrant public forum.",
    "Free speech is essential for democratic life, yet it must be balanced with narrowly defined limits on speech that directly threatens safety, incites imminent violence, or engages in sustained targeted harassment. Those limits should be applied transparently and with due process while prioritizing nonlegal tools\u2014education, counterspeech, restorative practices, and platform norms\u2014to address hateful ideas without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open debate and protecting people are both vital: uphold broad protections for nonviolent, unpopular expression while clearly prohibiting true threats, imminent incitement, and coordinated harassment that endangers others. Enforce narrow, evidence-based rules through due process and complement legal action with education, community dialogue, and responsible platform moderation to reduce harm and preserve civic trust.",
    "Free expression should remain robust so ideas can be contested, but society may legitimately restrict narrowly tailored speech that predictably produces immediate danger\u2014direct threats, calls for violence, or repeated targeted harassment. Transparent enforcement, judicial oversight, and investments in counterspeech, restorative measures, and education create a balanced approach that protects both liberty and human dignity.",
    "Defend broad freedom of expression while drawing clear, specific lines against speech that intentionally and imminently causes harm\u2014true threats, incitement to violence, or systematic dehumanization and harassment of vulnerable groups. Any restrictions should be precise, proportionate, and paired with public education, community remedies, and platform accountability to address root causes without silencing necessary controversy.",
    "Free speech and public safety can be reconciled by protecting wide-ranging debate but narrowly prohibiting direct threats, imminent incitement, and targeted harassment that undermines others\u2019 safety and dignity. Apply those limits through clear legal standards and due process while relying heavily on counterspeech, restorative practices, and institutional norms to heal harm and foster inclusive, resilient communities.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected as essential to democratic life, while narrowly and clearly limiting only speech that constitutes direct threats, true incitement to imminent violence, or sustained targeted harassment that creates real-world harm. Those limits must be applied with transparent legal standards, due process, and proportionate remedies, while nonlegal tools\u2014education, counterspeech, restorative practices, and responsible platform policies\u2014address hateful but noncriminal expression and promote community healing.",
    "Preserving open debate means protecting unpopular ideas, but not sheltering speech that intentionally and imminently endangers others; narrowly defined prohibitions on threats, coordination of violence, and systematic harassment should coexist with robust counterspeech, civic education, and clear institutional policies. Emphasis on precise definitions, judicial oversight, and accountability for amplification helps prevent chilling legitimate expression while safeguarding dignity and safety.",
    "Free expression is vital, yet society should draw clear, limited lines when words cross into actionable harm\u2014such as credible threats, organizing violence, or persistent targeted abuse\u2014and enforce those lines transparently. Complementing legal limits with community-led responses, platform moderation, and restorative education reduces harm without turning disagreement into censorship.",
    "Respecting both liberty and human dignity requires that speech be free to challenge and provoke, but not to incite immediate violence or systematically silence vulnerable people; narrow, well-defined restrictions on imminent threats and coordinated harassment, applied with due process, protect safety. Alongside those legal guardrails, investment in counterspeech, schooling, and restorative dialogue strengthens social resilience and reduces reliance on punitive measures.",
    "Maintain wide latitude for creative and political expression while prohibiting narrowly specified conduct\u2014true threats, incitement to imminent lawless action, and targeted campaigns that endanger individuals\u2014and ensure enforcement is precise, transparent, and subject to oversight. Prioritizing education, community norms, and proportionate platform responses addresses the roots and amplification of hateful speech without unduly chilling open inquiry.",
    "Free speech is essential for democratic life, but it must be balanced with narrowly defined limits on direct threats, incitement to imminent violence, and sustained targeted harassment so that safety and dignity are protected. Clear legal standards, due process, and transparent enforcement should be paired with education, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech to address hate without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open debate and protecting people are complementary goals: prohibit speech that intends and is likely to cause imminent harm, threats, or coordinated harassment while preserving space for unpopular or offensive but nonviolent expression. Emphasizing precise rules, independent oversight, and community-led remedies\u2014education, counterspeech, and platform accountability\u2014helps prevent abuse while keeping civic discourse vibrant.",
    "Free expression should be broad but not absolute: limit conduct-based harms such as true threats and clear incitement to violence through narrowly tailored laws and fair procedures, and rely on counterspeech, restorative dialogue, and platform moderation to address offensive or dehumanizing rhetoric. Focusing restrictions on actions rather than ideas and investing in prevention and civic education finds common ground between liberty and protection.",
    "A balanced approach defends robust public conversation while drawing precise lines against speech that predictably produces imminent harm, credible threats, or persistent harassment; such limits must be narrow, transparent, and subject to judicial and administrative safeguards. Complementary measures\u2014community norms, education, and proportional platform policies\u2014can reduce harm and heal divisions without resorting to broad censorship.",
    "Upholding free speech and safeguarding vulnerable people can coexist by targeting speech that directly and imminently endangers others\u2014threats, incitement, and organized harassment\u2014while using nonlegal tools like counterspeech, restorative practices, and education to confront hateful ideas. Clear definitions, due process, and accountable enforcement help prevent misuse of restrictions and preserve a lively, inclusive public sphere.",
    "Free speech is essential to democratic life, but it should not protect direct threats, clear incitement to imminent violence, or sustained targeted harassment that endangers others; limits should therefore be narrowly defined, focused on conduct and likely harm, and enforced through transparent procedures and due process. Outside those precise harms, nonviolent but offensive ideas are better met with counterspeech, education, and restorative community responses rather than broad censorship. Combining legal clarity with strong civic and platform-based remedies preserves open debate while protecting safety and dignity.",
    "Societies should vigorously defend open expression while drawing narrow, precisely worded lines against speech that intentionally incites violence, makes credible threats, or systematically silences people through targeted harassment. Those limits must be enforced with clear standards, judicial oversight, and proportional remedies, complemented by education, counterspeech, and restorative practices to address underlying prejudice. This balanced approach protects both robust debate and vulnerable members of the community.",
    "Free expression should remain broad to allow difficult and unpopular ideas, but it need not shield speech that foreseeably produces imminent harm\u2014such as true threats, direct calls to violence, or coordinated harassment\u2014so narrow legal limits are justified. Emphasizing transparency, due process, and nonlegal tools like education, community norms, and platform moderation reduces harm without chilling legitimate discourse. A combined legal and civic strategy fosters safety while preserving the marketplace of ideas.",
    "Protecting free speech and protecting people are complementary goals: preserve robust debate, satire, and dissent, while drawing clear, narrowly tailored boundaries against direct threats, incitement to immediate lawless action, and repeated targeted harassment. Enforcement should be predictable and rights-respecting, and where speech falls short of criminality prioritize counterspeech, education, restorative justice, and accountable platform policies to reduce amplification of hate. This synthesis honors liberty while safeguarding dignity and public safety.",
    "Open discourse is vital, but it must be balanced by narrowly defined prohibitions on speech that intentionally and imminently endangers others\u2014true threats, calls for violence, and sustained targeted harassment\u2014applied with due process and clear standards. For offensive yet nonviolent expression, invest in education, counter-speech, and restorative community measures rather than expansive legal bans, and use transparent platform policies to limit amplification of harmful content. Such a layered approach reconciles free expression with the obligation to protect vulnerable people.",
    "Free expression should be broadly protected as the engine of democratic debate, but narrowly defined limits are warranted for direct threats, clear incitement to imminent violence, and coordinated targeted harassment that causes tangible harm. Those limits must be transparent, applied with due process, and complemented by robust counterspeech, education, restorative practices, and accountable platform policies to protect dignity without chilling legitimate dissent.",
    "Upholding free speech and protecting people\u2019s safety are compatible goals when restrictions focus on conduct\u2014true threats, imminent calls to violence, and sustained, targeted harassment\u2014rather than unpopular ideas. Clear legal standards, fair enforcement, and investment in education, community dialogue, and non\u2011legal remedies like deplatforming and restorative justice help reduce harm while preserving open debate.",
    "Speech should remain wide open for contesting ideas, yet society should draw narrow, precisely defined lines against speech that foreseeably and imminently produces violence or systematically silences vulnerable people. Combining narrowly tailored laws with due process, strong counterspeech norms, and restorative community responses balances liberty and safety.",
    "Defend free speech as essential to civic life, while recognizing that expressions that amount to credible threats, incitement of immediate harm, or persistent targeted harassment deserve restriction. Applying such limits narrowly and transparently, and pairing them with education, platform accountability, and restorative practices, preserves open discourse and protects the dignity and safety of those at risk.",
    "Free speech should be preserved to allow difficult conversations, but it must not shield direct incitement, true threats, or coordinated harassment that endangers people; restrictions should therefore target conduct, be narrowly framed, and include procedural safeguards. Emphasizing counterspeech, civic education, and restorative measures reduces harm and helps sustain an inclusive public square without broad censorship.",
    "Free speech is essential for democratic life, but narrow, clearly defined limits are justified where speech intentionally and imminently incites violence, makes credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment; such limits should focus on conduct and immediate risk rather than unpopular ideas. Enforcement must be transparent and subject to due process, while noncriminal harms are best addressed through counterspeech, education, restorative practices, and responsible platform and institutional policies that protect dignity without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open expression and protecting people from real harm are complementary goals: prohibit true threats, clear incitement to imminent lawless action, and coordinated harassment that foreseeably endangers others, using narrowly tailored legal standards and judicial oversight. For offensive but nonviolent speech emphasize education, robust counter-speech, community norms, and platform accountability to reduce harm and preserve a vibrant public square.",

Complementary nonlegal tools like counterspeech, restorative dialogue, educational programs, and transparent institutional policies help heal communities and limit the harms of hateful rhetoric without resorting to sweeping censorship.",
    "Upholding the marketplace of ideas requires limiting only those forms of expression that intentionally and imminently threaten safety or constitute credible, targeted harassment, with narrow statutes and fair enforcement to avoid chilling debate. Alongside legal safeguards, invest in counterspeech, civic education, restorative accountability, and responsible moderation by platforms and institutions to address prejudice and repair harm.",
    "Free speech must be balanced with public safety and human dignity by narrowly banning direct threats, incitement to imminent violence, and coordinated harassment, while leaving broad protection for contentious but nonviolent views. Pairing precise legal limits and due process with education, community dialogue, restorative measures, and transparent platform rules best protects vulnerable people without silencing legitimate expression.",
    "Free speech is essential for democratic life, but it should not shield speech that intentionally threatens, incites imminent violence, or engages in sustained targeted harassment; limits must be narrowly defined, evidence-based, and applied with due process to avoid chilling legitimate debate. Where speech falls short of those clear harms, societies should prioritize counterspeech, education, restorative practices, and transparent platform rules to protect dignity while preserving a robust marketplace of ideas.",
    "Protecting open debate and protecting people\u2019s safety are both core values, so legal restrictions should focus only on direct incitement, credible threats, and coordinated harassment that pose an imminent risk, while nonviolent hateful expression is best met with education, community accountability, and vigorous counter-speech. Clear definitions, transparent enforcement, and proportional remedies help reconcile concerns about censorship with the need to prevent real-world harm.",
    "Free expression must be preserved broadly, but it is reasonable to draw narrow, well-publicized lines against speech that predictably and imminently causes physical harm or is intended to terrorize or exclude people from public life. Governments and platforms should apply those limits through clear legal standards and due process, while civil society invests in education, restorative dialogue, and amplification of marginalized voices so hateful ideas are challenged rather than driven underground.",
    "Open discourse is indispensable, yet speech that constitutes true threats, incites imminent lawless action, or targets individuals with sustained harassment should not be protected and must be addressed through narrowly tailored law and fair procedures. Complementary measures\u2014education, counterspeech, and transparent platform policies\u2014can reduce harm without silencing contentious but nonviolent viewpoints.",
    "Balancing liberty and safety means limiting only conduct-focused harms\u2014direct threats, imminent incitement, and coordinated harassment\u2014while preserving debate on unpopular ideas; such limits require precise definitions, judicial oversight, and proportional enforcement to prevent abuse. For offensive yet nonviolent speech, communities should prioritize counterspeech, education, and restorative remedies to protect dignity and strengthen civic norms.",
    "Free speech is foundational to democratic life, but it must be balanced with narrow, clearly defined limits on direct threats, true incitement to imminent violence, and sustained targeted harassment that endangers people. Those limits should be applied through due process and paired with education, counterspeech, and community-based restorative measures so safety and dignity are protected without needlessly silencing legitimate debate.",
    "Protect broad, nonviolent expression to preserve debate and the search for truth, while narrowly restricting speech that intentionally and imminently threatens or organizes harm or persistent harassment. Legal rules should focus on conduct not ideas and be precise and procedurally safeguarded. Complementary strategies\u2014education, counterspeech, platform transparency, and restorative practices\u2014should address hateful attitudes and reduce harm without expansive censorship.",
    "A common-sense approach upholds robust free expression but draws clear lines against speech that causes real-world danger: direct threats, credible incitement to imminent violence, and coordinated harassment. Enforceable, narrow standards and due process, combined with education, community norms, and counter-speech, protect vulnerable people while preserving space for unpopular or uncomfortable ideas.",
    "Free speech should be broadly defended as essential to civic life, yet it does not protect deliberate actions that predictably lead to violence or silence others through targeted abuse. Limits must be narrowly tailored, clearly defined, and applied transparently with judicial oversight or similar safeguards to avoid chilling legitimate discourse, while societies invest in education, restorative responses, and responsible platform design to counter hateful ideas and heal harms.",
    "Balancing liberty and safety means protecting open debate while narrowly prohibiting speech that constitutes true threats, incitement to imminent lawless action, or coordinated harassment that undermines equal participation. Those prohibitions should be precise, subject to due process, and supplemented by counterspeech, education, and community-led remedies that address underlying prejudice and preserve democratic exchange.",
    "Free speech is essential to democracy and the exchange of ideas, but it should not protect direct threats, clear incitement to imminent violence, or coordinated, targeted harassment that endangers people. Any restrictions must be narrowly defined, applied with due process, and paired with education, counterspeech, and community or platform accountability to address harm without chilling legitimate debate.",

    "Protecting open debate requires strong free-speech protections alongside clear, narrow prohibitions on speech that foreseeably and imminently causes physical harm, targets individuals with threats, or systematically silences marginalized people. Complementary measures\u2014transparent rules, fair enforcement, public education, and robust counterspeech\u2014can reduce harm while preserving space for unpopular ideas.",
    "Society should defend broad expression but draw narrow, well-defined lines against true threats, coordination of violence, and sustained harassment that undermines safety and dignity. Those limits must be legally precise, applied with due process, and paired with community-led education, restorative practices, and platform accountability to challenge hateful ideas without resorting to sweeping censorship.",
    "Free speech must be protected to allow challenging ideas to be aired, yet conduct that intentionally incites imminent violence, issues credible threats, or engages in coordinated harassment should be restricted. Combining narrow legal boundaries with transparent enforcement, counterspeech, and investment in education and healing offers a practical way to safeguard both liberty and vulnerable people.",
    "A balanced approach upholds robust free expression while narrowly prohibiting speech that directly and imminently endangers others through threats, incitement, or targeted harassment. Clear definitions, due process, proportional enforcement, and nonlegal responses\u2014education, counterspeech, and restorative dialogue\u2014can protect dignity and public safety without silencing legitimate discourse."
