    "Laws on abortion should be guided by a commitment to human dignity that takes seriously both the value many place on developing life and the lived reality that pregnancy can involve medical risk, trauma, and profound hardship. A workable approach is clear, medically grounded rules that protect urgent care and patient safety, pair any limits with explicit health exceptions, and invest heavily in prevention and support\u2014contraception access, accurate education, prenatal care, and help for parents\u2014so fewer people ever face a crisis decision.",
    "Abortion law should aim to reduce suffering and protect life by centering medical evidence, compassion, and responsibility rather than punishment or political symbolism. Common ground can look like protecting early, safe access and emergency care, setting transparent standards later in pregnancy with narrowly defined exceptions, and strengthening the social supports\u2014healthcare, childcare, paid leave, and adoption resources\u2014that make carrying a pregnancy to term a real option.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should reflect humility about how complex these situations are, protecting people from dangerous outcomes while acknowledging the moral seriousness many attach to unborn life. That means decisions should stay as close as possible to the patient and clinician, with clear protections when health is at risk, alongside serious investments in contraception, education, and family supports that prevent unwanted pregnancies and reduce the need for abortion.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by respect for conscience and equal concern for both women and unborn life, recognizing that one-size-fits-all bans or anything-goes rules fail real families. A durable compromise prioritizes safety and privacy, ensures unambiguous medical exceptions, and couples any legal boundaries with practical help\u2014prenatal care, mental health services, adoption support, and economic assistance\u2014so choices are less coerced by desperation.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by the shared goal of fewer tragedies: protecting patients\u2019 health and autonomy while also taking seriously the state\u2019s interest in potential life as pregnancy progresses. Clear, evidence-based standards with guaranteed emergency and health exceptions, plus robust prevention and support for families, can lower abortion rates without criminalizing people in crisis.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by a commitment to protect health and human dignity while taking seriously that many citizens view developing life as morally significant. A workable approach keeps urgent medical care clearly legal, sets transparent standards that doctors can follow, and pairs any limits with strong prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, adoption options, and help for parents\u2014so fewer people ever face this decision in crisis.",
    "Abortion law should aim for fewer tragedies and fewer desperate choices by combining compassion with clear, medically grounded rules. That means protecting timely care and privacy in early pregnancy, defining narrow, reliable exceptions for life- and health-threatening situations and pregnancies from violence, and investing in the supports that reduce abortions in the first place\u2014contraception, education, childcare, and economic stability.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by harm reduction: keep people safe, keep doctors able to act, and keep families from being punished by rigid one-size-fits-all bans. At the same time, policy can acknowledge moral concern for unborn life by setting consistent guardrails later in pregnancy and by expanding real alternatives\u2014healthcare, paid leave, adoption support, and resources that make carrying to term a viable choice.",
    "Abortion policy should be built around two shared goals: protecting patients in real medical emergencies and reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies. Clear, evidence-based protections for clinical decision-making can coexist with reasonable limits and broad investments in prevention and family support, so the law reflects both compassion for women in crisis and concern for potential life.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by humility about complex circumstances and by a practical commitment to safeguard both lives and liberties. The most durable middle ground keeps care accessible and medically supervised, guarantees explicit exceptions for serious health risks, and funds prevention and support systems\u2014contraception, accurate education, prenatal care, and help for parents\u2014so fewer families are forced into impossible choices.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by both the moral seriousness many attach to developing life and the practical need to protect a pregnant person\u2019s health, safety, and ability to make time-sensitive medical decisions. A workable approach pairs clear, medically grounded rules\u2014including unambiguous exceptions for life, health, and the most traumatic circumstances\u2014with major investments in prevention and support like comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, adoption options, and childcare. The shared aim should be fewer crises and less suffering, achieved through compassion and real resources rather than punishment.",
    "Abortion law should start from a commitment to human dignity: taking seriously concerns about unborn life while ensuring that no one is forced into dangerous delays or one-size-fits-all mandates. That means predictable limits that track medical realities, strong protections for emergency care and severe hardship, and a public focus on reducing unintended pregnancy through education, contraception, and family supports. Common ground grows when policy is written to be humane and workable for patients, clinicians, and communities.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by harm reduction and humility\u2014recognizing that people disagree about when life begins, but most agree that health, safety, and dignity matter. Policy can combine early access and privacy with carefully defined later-pregnancy guardrails and clear medical exceptions so doctors can act without fear. Alongside any legal line, society should expand practical supports that prevent crisis pregnancies and make parenting or adoption realistic options.",
    "Abortion policy should reflect two responsibilities at once: protecting potential life where possible and protecting the living person who bears the medical risks of pregnancy. The best laws are medically clear, avoid criminalizing patients and clinicians, and include real exceptions for threats to life and health, sexual violence, and catastrophic fetal diagnoses. Prevention and support\u2014contraception access, accurate education, prenatal care, and help for families\u2014are the most durable shared strategy for reducing abortions.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, evidence, and a stable commitment to supporting families, rather than treating tragedy as a political weapon. A middle path protects timely care and decision-making with clinicians, sets transparent standards as pregnancy advances, and guarantees straightforward exceptions for medical emergencies. At the same time, reducing unwanted pregnancies and strengthening the safety net can honor differing moral convictions while lowering the number of abortions in practice.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by a commitment to reduce harm: protecting people\u2019s health and privacy while taking seriously the moral concern many feel for developing life. A durable approach keeps urgent medical decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians, sets clear and workable guardrails with unambiguous health exceptions, and pairs any limits with real prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and resources for parents and adoption.",
    "Abortion policy should aim for dignity and practicality over punishment, recognizing both the value many place on unborn life and the complex realities pregnant people face. That means clear rules that safeguard emergency care and avoid criminalizing patients or doctors, alongside robust investments that prevent crisis pregnancies and make parenting a feasible choice\u2014contraception, education, healthcare, and family supports.",
    "Laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and the shared goal of fewer tragedies\u2014whether that means preventing unwanted pregnancies or protecting families when complications arise. Common ground looks like early, safe access; later limits that reflect medical realities with explicit life-and-health exceptions; and a strong safety net so no one is forced by poverty, violence, or lack of care into any decision.",
    "Abortion laws should balance respect for personal autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting developing life, and they should be written clearly enough that doctors can act quickly when health is at stake. Whatever lines are drawn, the most unifying move is to reduce the number of people reaching this crossroads through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and meaningful support for pregnancy, birth, and childrearing.",
    "A workable abortion framework starts from two commitments: safeguard human life where possible and never sacrifice a patient\u2019s safety to politics. Policies can reflect that by keeping care legal and timely early on, defining later restrictions in medically grounded terms with broad, explicit exceptions, and backing it all with prevention and supports that expand real choices for families.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by both a respect for developing human life and a respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and real-world circumstances. A durable approach protects timely medical care with clear, workable exceptions for life and serious health risks, while setting transparent standards that don\u2019t criminalize families or clinicians acting in good faith. Common ground grows when policy also invests in prevention\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception\u2014and in concrete supports for parenting, prenatal care, and adoption so fewer people face crisis choices.",
    "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a shared commitment to reduce harm for women, children, and families. That means keeping emergency and medically necessary care plainly legal, avoiding vague rules that chill doctors\u2019 judgment, and recognizing that many citizens see fetal life as morally significant. Pairing any legal framework with serious prevention and family support\u2014contraception, sex education, healthcare, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014offers the best chance at fewer abortions and less suffering.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by the goal of protecting dignity: the dignity of potential life and the dignity of the person who is pregnant. Practically, that calls for clear, medically grounded rules that safeguard early access and guarantee swift exceptions for threats to life or serious health, while treating later-pregnancy decisions with seriousness rather than slogans. Broad investments in contraception, education, and support for parents can reduce unwanted pregnancies and make more outcomes feel possible.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by humility about hard cases, evidence about health outcomes, and a commitment to protect both vulnerable unborn life and vulnerable families in crisis. A workable compromise focuses on keeping decisions close to patients and clinicians\u2014especially in emergencies\u2014while allowing society to set careful, transparent limits that are consistent and enforceable. Strengthening prevention and the safety net can lower abortion rates without relying on punishment or shame.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by a balance of rights and responsibilities: safeguarding bodily autonomy and medical privacy while acknowledging many people\u2019s conviction that fetal life deserves protection. The law should be clear enough for doctors to act quickly in emergencies and compassionate enough to account for rape, incest, and severe medical complications without forcing families into delay or danger. At the same time, prevention and support\u2014contraception access, honest education, prenatal care, childcare, and adoption options\u2014should be central so fewer people reach this decision at all.",
    "Laws on abortion should be grounded in compassion and medical reality, protecting patients and clinicians with clear, workable rules that prioritize safety in emergencies while taking seriously the moral concern many feel about developing life. A durable approach pairs any legal limits with explicit health exceptions and invests heavily in prevention\u2014accurate sex education, affordable contraception, and strong support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption\u2014so fewer people face crisis decisions. The aim should be less harm, fewer unwanted pregnancies, and more real choices rather than stigma or political gamesmanship.",
    "Abortion law should balance respect for bodily autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, using medically grounded standards that doctors can follow without fear. Whatever the gestational line, it should include unambiguous exceptions for life and serious health risks and avoid criminalizing patients in crisis. Common ground grows when the law is paired with practical supports\u2014contraception, healthcare, paid leave, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014that reduce unintended pregnancies and make carrying to term more feasible.",
    "Laws should acknowledge that abortion is both a healthcare decision and a profound moral question, so policy should be evidence-based, humane, and written to fit real-life complications. Protect early, timely access and ensure clear protections in cases of rape, incest, severe fetal conditions, or threats to the patient\u2019s life or health, while allowing reasonable, consistent guardrails later in pregnancy. Then put major effort into prevention and support so fewer families ever reach this crossroads.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided less by punishment and more by reducing suffering: keep care safe and legally accessible where delays increase risk, and protect clinicians who act in good-faith medical emergencies. At the same time, it can recognize the value many place on unborn life by setting transparent limits and strengthening alternatives through prenatal care, adoption support, and material help for parents. The shared goal is fewer crises and healthier families, not scoring ideological wins.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should start from dignity for everyone involved\u2014women, families, and developing life\u2014by keeping decisions close to patients and medical professionals and ensuring no one is forced into dangerous situations. If limits exist, they must be clear, medically informed, and paired with explicit exceptions for serious health threats and pregnancy from violence. The broadest agreement comes from preventing unwanted pregnancies and expanding support so choosing to parent or place for adoption is truly possible.",
    "Abortion law should protect people from avoidable harm by keeping urgent medical care timely and safe, while also taking seriously the conviction many hold that developing life deserves protection. A durable framework pairs clear, medically workable rules and exceptions for life and serious health risks (and other tragic circumstances society recognizes) with strong prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and real help for parents and adoption\u2014so fewer families are driven to crisis choices.",
    "Laws on abortion should be grounded in compassion and medical reality, recognizing both the moral weight many attach to unborn life and the autonomy and safety needs of the person who is pregnant. Common ground is clearer when policy sets transparent standards that keep decisions close to patients and clinicians in emergencies, and invests heavily in what reduces abortions without coercion: contraception access, comprehensive education, maternal healthcare, childcare, and adoption support.",
    "Abortion policy should aim for fewer tragedies, not louder politics, by combining respect for potential life with respect for bodily autonomy and clinical judgment. That means predictable rules with explicit protections for life-threatening and serious health situations, alongside robust social supports and prevention so continuing a pregnancy is genuinely feasible and unintended pregnancy becomes rarer.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should prioritize safety, dignity, and responsibility, acknowledging that people disagree in good faith about when legal protection should begin. A workable approach protects timely care and privacy early on, sets any later limits in medically grounded terms with clear exceptions, and backs it up with practical commitments\u2014education, contraception, healthcare, paid leave, and support for parenting or adoption\u2014so the decision is less often forced by hardship.",
    "Abortion laws should be written with humility: they must not treat pregnancy as a slogan, nor ignore that ending it can feel morally profound to many. The most unifying path is to keep care safe and medically guided, ensure clear exceptions when health is at stake, and invest in prevention and family support so fewer people face the choice and more children are welcomed into stable circumstances.",
    "Abortion law should be built around two shared commitments: protecting health and dignity in real medical situations, and taking seriously the moral concern many feel about developing life. A durable framework would keep early care safe and accessible, set clearer standards as pregnancy advances with well-defined exceptions for life, health, and pregnancies from violence, and avoid criminalizing patients or clinicians acting in good faith. Whatever the limits, it should be paired with proven prevention and support\u2014contraception, accurate education, prenatal care, and economic help for parents\u2014so fewer people ever face a crisis decision.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to reduce harm while respecting that citizens differ, often sincerely, about when legal protection for unborn life should begin. That points to rules that protect timely medical care and privacy, include clear emergency and health exceptions, and draw any later restrictions in medically workable terms rather than political slogans. Common ground grows when the law also invests in prevention and family support\u2014contraception, sex education, adoption pathways, and resources for parents\u2014so choosing to carry a pregnancy is a real option, not a forced hardship.",
    "Abortion policy should reflect both compassion for the person who is pregnant and a genuine public interest in potential life, without pretending the hardest cases are rare or simple. A balanced approach protects safe access early, allows evidence-based limits later with explicit exceptions for life, serious health risks, and severe circumstances like rape, and keeps clinicians\u2014not prosecutors\u2014at the center of urgent decisions. The most practical way to reduce abortions is to expand contraception, comprehensive education, and concrete support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by humility: the recognition that pregnancy can be medically and morally complex, and that rigid rules can cause preventable suffering. Policies can honor differing convictions by safeguarding early, private access to care, defining later regulations around viability and medical judgment with clear life-and-health protections, and avoiding punitive approaches that drive care underground. Broad agreement is easiest around prevention and support\u2014education, contraception, prenatal and mental health care, and help for families\u2014so fewer people are cornered into any decision.",
    "Abortion law should strive for clarity and care: protect patients in emergencies, respect conscience and moral seriousness, and avoid using the criminal system to manage medical reality. That can mean legal access early in pregnancy, medically grounded guardrails later with precise exceptions for life, health, and extreme situations, and straightforward standards doctors can follow. At the same time, society should put real resources into preventing unintended pregnancy and supporting parents and children so the number of abortions falls through support, not coercion.",
    "Abortion law should be built around two duties that many people share: protecting human dignity and keeping patients safe in real medical situations. A workable approach sets clear, medically grounded rules with prompt exceptions for life- and health-threatening complications, and it couples any limits with serious prevention and support\u2014contraception, accurate sex education, prenatal care, adoption services, and help for parents\u2014so fewer families face crisis choices. The aim is fewer abortions and less suffering without turning private tragedies into political punishment.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should acknowledge the moral seriousness many attach to developing life while also respecting bodily autonomy and the need for timely, evidence-based healthcare. Common ground comes from clear standards that don\u2019t criminalize patients or clinicians in emergencies, paired with investments that reduce unintended pregnancies and strengthen families\u2014contraception access, comprehensive education, healthcare, childcare, and adoption support. The measure of success should be fewer crisis pregnancies and safer outcomes for women, children, and communities.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by compassion and practicality: protect life where possible, but never ignore medical reality or force people into dangerous delays. Durable law can combine predictable limits with explicit exceptions for threats to health and life and for the most traumatic circumstances, while also funding prevention and family supports that make carrying to term a real option. This shifts the focus from blame to shared goals\u2014health, responsibility, and fewer abortions.",
    "Laws on abortion should aim to reduce harm by keeping decisions as close as possible to patients and clinicians, while recognizing society\u2019s interest in potential life as pregnancy progresses. A balanced framework pairs early access and privacy protections with later, medically informed guardrails and clear emergency pathways, and it invests heavily in contraception, sex education, prenatal care, and economic supports for parents. That approach honors conscience on both sides by reducing unwanted pregnancies and avoiding cruelty in hard cases.",
    "Abortion laws should be guided by the shared belief that no one should be abandoned in a crisis\u2014neither the pregnant person nor the developing child. Clear, humane rules should protect urgent medical care and leave room for conscience, while communities and governments shoulder more of the burden through prevention, healthcare, and practical support for parenting or adoption. When policy prioritizes safety, clarity, and real options, it becomes easier to disagree without dehumanizing.",
    "Laws on abortion should treat pregnancy as both a serious moral matter and a real-world medical reality, protecting people from danger while respecting that many want to safeguard developing life. A workable framework keeps urgent decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians, includes clear, medically defined exceptions, and pairs any limits with strong prevention and family supports\u2014contraception access, honest education, prenatal care, childcare, and adoption resources. The shared aim should be fewer crises, less suffering, and more families able to choose life freely rather than by coercion or desperation.",
    "Abortion law should be guided by compassion and practicality: protect health and safety, recognize sincere moral convictions about unborn life, and avoid rules so rigid that they endanger patients or punish families in crisis. Common ground comes from clear standards doctors can follow, meaningful exceptions for life and serious health threats, and major investments in prevention and support so fewer unintended pregnancies occur. If policy prioritizes dignity and workable care over political point-scoring, disagreement becomes more manageable.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to minimize harm while taking seriously the value many attach to both bodily autonomy and developing human life. That points toward early, safe, legal access; carefully defined limits later in pregnancy tied to medical realities; and explicit protections for emergencies, rape, and incest. Pairing the law with contraception, comprehensive sex education, and robust support for parents and adoption can reduce abortions without resorting to shame or coercion.",
    "Abortion policy should start with two commitments that can coexist: no one should be forced into unsafe medical situations, and society should work to reduce the conditions that make ending a pregnancy feel like the only option. Clear, evidence-based rules with health exceptions can protect patients, while expanded contraception, education, prenatal care, and economic support can reduce unintended pregnancies and make parenting or adoption more feasible. The goal is fewer tragedies and more real choices.",
    "Laws on abortion should reflect humility about hard cases, protecting private medical decision-making while acknowledging the moral gravity many people feel about ending a potential life. A stable approach emphasizes safety, clear clinician-guided exceptions, and prevention through contraception and accurate education, alongside concrete support for those who carry to term. When the focus is care and responsibility rather than punishment, more people can recognize their values in the outcome.",
    "Laws on abortion should recognize two truths at once: many people see unborn life as deserving protection, and pregnancy can involve urgent, deeply personal medical realities that require timely care. A durable approach would keep patients safe with clear health exceptions and medically workable standards, while investing heavily in prevention and support\u2014education, contraception, prenatal care, and resources for parents and adoption\u2014so fewer families face crisis choices. The goal should be less suffering and more stability, not punishment or politics.",
    "Abortion law should be guided by compassion and humility, protecting both human dignity and public health in situations that rarely fit slogans. That means clear, evidence-based rules that don\u2019t trap doctors and patients in emergencies, alongside serious efforts to reduce unintended pregnancies and strengthen the safety net for anyone who carries to term. People can disagree about moral boundaries while still agreeing that the system should be safe, workable, and supportive.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance a society\u2019s interest in protecting developing life with a person\u2019s right to make time-sensitive medical decisions in consultation with qualified clinicians. Common ground is strongest when policy guarantees real protections for life- and health-threatening cases and avoids criminalizing people in crisis, while also expanding the practical supports that prevent unwanted pregnancies and make parenting or adoption feasible. A focus on prevention, clarity, and care can lower abortions without increasing harm.",
    "Abortion policy should aim to reduce harm by pairing medically clear guardrails with robust support for families, rather than relying on extremes that ignore real-life complexity. Protecting access to safe care\u2014especially when health is at risk\u2014can coexist with measures that honor concerns about unborn life, such as prevention, early decision support, and concrete assistance for pregnancy, childbirth, and childrearing. The measure of the law should be whether it keeps people safe and expands real options.",
    "Laws on abortion should start from a commitment to protect the vulnerable on all sides: the pregnant person facing risk or hardship and the developing life many believe merits moral concern. A workable compromise prioritizes medical judgment and clear emergency exceptions, while setting transparent standards and backing them with contraception access, accurate education, and meaningful economic and healthcare support for parents. If policy reduces crisis pregnancies and avoids cruelty, it can earn broader trust even amid disagreement.",
    "Laws on abortion should recognize both the moral seriousness many people attach to unborn life and the reality that pregnancy can involve urgent, complex medical and personal circumstances. A workable approach protects safe, timely care\u2014especially early and in emergencies\u2014while setting clear, medically grounded standards and exceptions so neither patients nor clinicians are trapped by vague rules. Common ground grows when any legal framework is paired with proven prevention and support: comprehensive education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical resources that make carrying a pregnancy to term a real option.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by two duties at once: safeguarding women\u2019s health and dignity, and taking seriously the widespread conviction that developing life deserves protection. That points toward clear, evidence-based rules that keep critical decisions with patients and clinicians, include explicit health exceptions, and avoid criminalizing people in crisis. Whatever limits are set, they should be matched with real investments that reduce unwanted pregnancies and hardship\u2014contraception access, accurate education, and stronger support for parents and children.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to reduce harm in the real world while respecting that citizens disagree, in good faith, about when legal protection should begin. A stable compromise focuses on safety and clarity\u2014protecting early access, guaranteeing straightforward exceptions for life and serious health risks, and keeping politicians out of time-sensitive clinical judgment. The broadest agreement is in prevention and support: fewer unintended pregnancies through education and contraception, and more help for anyone who continues a pregnancy.",
    "Abortion laws should be written with humility: treating the decision as morally weighty, yet acknowledging that one-size-fits-all bans can create dangerous delays when medicine and circumstance don\u2019t cooperate. Policies can protect potential life by encouraging earlier, informed decision-making and by defining clear, workable medical exceptions that prioritize patient safety. The strongest common ground is building conditions that make abortions rarer without coercion\u2014reliable contraception, comprehensive sex education, and robust support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption.",
    "What should guide abortion laws is a commitment to dignity, safety, and responsibility for both women and developing life, without turning private crises into political theater. That means clear, medically informed guardrails that preserve access to care\u2014especially early and in emergencies\u2014while making room for conscience and narrowly defined exceptions in tragic cases. Lasting policy also requires shared investments that prevent unwanted pregnancies and support families: education, contraception, healthcare, and practical help for parents.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by a commitment to protect human dignity in all its forms: the moral value many see in developing life and the health, autonomy, and safety of the person who is pregnant. A durable approach keeps emergency and medically necessary care unequivocally legal, reduces the number of crisis pregnancies through contraception access and accurate education, and backs any legal framework with real supports like prenatal care, childcare, and adoption services. The goal should be fewer tragedies and more stable families, not punishment or political point-scoring.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by humility about hard cases and a shared desire to reduce harm, recognizing both the moral seriousness many attach to fetal life and the real medical and economic realities families face. That means clear, workable rules that protect timely care when health is at risk, avoid criminalizing patients and clinicians, and pair whatever limits exist with strong prevention and support\u2014education, contraception, prenatal care, and help for parents. Common ground is likelier when the law prioritizes safety, clarity, and fewer unintended pregnancies.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion and medical reality, while taking seriously the conviction that potential life deserves respect. The most workable path keeps decisions as close as possible to patients and clinicians, guarantees explicit exceptions for life-threatening and severe health situations, and invests in prevention and family support so fewer people reach a crisis point. Whatever lines are drawn, they should be written clearly enough to protect both families and emergency care.",
    "Abortion laws should be guided by two commitments that many people share even when they disagree on limits: protecting life and preventing needless suffering. That points toward policies that keep care safe and available early and in emergencies, set later-pregnancy rules around medical evidence and viability with clear health exceptions, and expand supports that make parenting or adoption realistic options. Prevention\u2014through contraception, education, and economic support\u2014can be a unifying goal regardless of moral starting point.",
    "What should guide abortion law is not ideology but a practical ethic of care: safeguard pregnant patients from medical danger, honor sincere moral concerns about unborn life, and reduce the circumstances that drive desperate decisions. Laws should be clear for clinicians, include straightforward exceptions for serious health threats and traumatic cases, and be paired with contraception access, prenatal care, and family resources. If policy is judged by whether it reduces harm and supports families, more people can live with it even amid disagreement.",
    "Abortion laws should be guided by a commitment to protect health and human dignity while taking seriously the moral weight many people attach to developing life. A workable framework keeps urgent medical care clearly legal, draws any limits in medically grounded, predictable terms with humane exceptions, and avoids criminalizing patients or doctors acting in good faith. Common ground grows when policy also invests in prevention and support\u2014education, contraception, prenatal care, adoption services, and help for parents\u2014so fewer families face crisis choices.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to reduce harm in the real world: safeguard a pregnant person\u2019s life and health, respect conscience, and acknowledge society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life. Whatever limits are set should be clear enough for doctors to follow in emergencies and paired with robust support\u2014contraception access, accurate sex education, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families. That combination can lower unintended pregnancies and make the law feel less like punishment and more like care.",
    "Abortion policy should be written with humility about complex circumstances, protecting timely, evidence-based medical care while recognizing sincere moral disagreements about when life deserves legal protection. If the law sets boundaries, it should include explicit exceptions for threats to health, rape, and severe fetal conditions, and it should not force families into needless delays or fear of prosecution. Real common ground comes from pairing any legal framework with prevention and support so fewer people are pushed into this decision by lack of resources.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance bodily autonomy and respect for developing life by prioritizing safety, privacy, and clear medical standards over political slogans. They should guarantee emergency and health-protecting care, define any restrictions in practical, clinician-informed terms, and avoid turning desperate situations into criminal cases. Alongside that, communities and governments should expand contraception, education, and family supports to reduce unintended pregnancies and make carrying a pregnancy more feasible.",
    "Abortion laws should start from two shared commitments: no one should be forced into dangerous medical circumstances, and society should take responsibility for supporting parents and children. Policies can reflect moral concern for unborn life through carefully drawn, medically workable limits and through strong assistance\u2014prenatal care, adoption pathways, childcare, and paid leave\u2014rather than through broad bans that ignore hard cases. When prevention and support are taken seriously, disagreements about legality become less zero-sum and more focused on reducing crises.",
    "Abortion laws should be built around two shared duties: protecting human dignity and protecting people from preventable harm. A workable approach keeps time-sensitive medical decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians with clear, medically defined exceptions for life and serious health risks, while setting transparent guardrails that reflect society\u2019s interest in developing life. The strongest common ground is pairing any legal framework with serious investment in prevention and support\u2014contraception access, accurate education, prenatal care, adoption options, and childcare\u2014so fewer families ever face this crisis.",
    "Laws on abortion should reflect humility about hard cases and a commitment to compassion, safety, and responsibility. That means clear rules that protect emergency care and respect conscience, while also acknowledging the moral concern many feel for unborn life through reasonable, medically grounded limits that don\u2019t criminalize people in crisis. Common ground grows when the law is paired with practical supports that reduce unintended pregnancy and make carrying to term a viable choice.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided less by slogans and more by what reduces suffering: medically sound standards, privacy in the exam room, and real support for families. A durable compromise protects early access and ensures unambiguous exceptions for serious health threats, while allowing democratically set, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy that are clear for clinicians to follow. Whatever the line, prevention and support\u2014education, contraception, prenatal care, and childcare\u2014should be the centerpiece so fewer people are pushed into desperate decisions.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should try to honor both the value many place on developing life and the reality that pregnancy can involve risk, coercion, and hardship that outsiders can\u2019t fully judge. The most humane path is to safeguard timely medical care with clear health exceptions, avoid punitive approaches that endanger patients, and focus on lowering abortions through prevention and family supports. When communities make it easier to avoid unintended pregnancy and to raise children with dignity, the legal conflict shrinks.",
    "Abortion laws should aim for predictable, medically grounded rules that protect life where possible without turning private crises into criminal cases. This means ensuring clinicians can act quickly in emergencies, treating rape, incest, and severe complications with clarity and compassion, and setting any limits in a way that is enforceable without endangering patients. Broad agreement is most likely when policy also expands contraception, sex education, prenatal care, adoption resources, and support for parents.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a commitment to protect human dignity in all its forms: the moral value many attach to developing life and the real-world health, autonomy, and safety needs of the pregnant person. A workable framework pairs clear, medically grounded rules and humane exceptions for threats to life or serious health risks with strong, practical support\u2014contraception access, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, adoption options, and help for parents\u2014so fewer people are driven into crisis. The aim should be less punishment and more prevention, clarity, and compassion.",
    "Abortion law should be guided less by absolutist slogans and more by harm reduction: keeping patients safe, giving clinicians clear standards, and treating the decision as morally serious. That can mean protecting earlier access while setting carefully defined limits later in pregnancy, with explicit exceptions for medical emergencies and extreme circumstances. Common ground grows when policy also invests in preventing unintended pregnancies and in making it genuinely feasible to carry a pregnancy to term.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by both compassion and accountability\u2014recognizing the state\u2019s interest in potential life and the pregnant person\u2019s right to timely, evidence-based medical care. Clear exceptions for life-threatening or serious health situations, and rules written so doctors can act without fear, can reduce tragedies without pretending every case is the same. Pairing any legal line with real supports for families and prevention efforts is the most durable way to lower abortions and suffering.",
    "What should guide abortion law is a shared goal most people can accept: fewer unwanted pregnancies, fewer medical crises, and fewer families abandoned to make life-altering decisions alone. That requires keeping care safe and medically supervised, drawing lines that are understandable and enforceable, and ensuring firm protections when health or life is at risk. It also requires a serious safety net\u2014contraception, education, healthcare, childcare, and adoption support\u2014so choices are real rather than coerced by circumstance.",
    "Abortion laws should be guided by humility about hard cases and by practical compassion: protecting life where possible while avoiding rules that endanger patients or criminalize doctors acting in emergencies. A balanced approach can respect moral disagreement by combining early-pregnancy access with carefully defined later limits and robust, explicit medical exceptions. The strongest bridge is prevention and support\u2014better education, contraception, and resources for parents\u2014so fewer pregnancies become crises in the first place.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by a commitment to protect life and health in the real world, recognizing both the moral gravity many attach to unborn life and the autonomy and medical needs of the person who is pregnant. A workable approach keeps urgent medical care and early access safe and legal, sets clear and clinically grounded standards later in pregnancy with explicit exceptions for life- and health-threatening complications and cases of sexual violence, and avoids rules that leave doctors guessing. Common ground grows when policy also invests in prevention and support\u2014comprehensive education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and practical help for parents and adoption\u2014so fewer families face crisis decisions in the first place.",
    "Abortion laws should be guided by reducing harm while taking seriously that many people view pregnancy as involving a developing human life worthy of protection. That means clear, medically workable rules that safeguard emergency care and respect privacy, alongside limits that become stronger as pregnancy progresses and include unambiguous health and safety exceptions. The most durable compromise pairs any legal framework with concrete prevention and family supports\u2014contraception, accurate education, healthcare, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014so the choice is less common and less coerced by circumstance.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion and medical reality, without dismissing the sincere belief that unborn life has moral value. A bridge is to keep decisions primarily with patients and clinicians\u2014especially early and in emergencies\u2014while allowing carefully defined protections for later pregnancy that don\u2019t endanger women or criminalize doctors. Whatever the limits, common ground requires serious investment in preventing unintended pregnancy and supporting families so people aren\u2019t pushed toward any outcome by poverty, isolation, or lack of care.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by two shared responsibilities: protecting people from preventable suffering and ensuring society supports parents and children rather than abandoning them. Clear legal access to safe care early in pregnancy, plus explicit exceptions for threats to life or serious health risks, can coexist with tighter, medically informed rules later that reflect the growing moral concern many feel. Meeting in the middle also means funding the things that reduce abortions without coercion\u2014education, contraception, prenatal and mental health care, paid leave, childcare, and workable adoption pathways.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by the principle that government must not turn complex medical crises into legal traps, while still recognizing that many citizens want the law to show respect for developing life. A practical middle path protects safe, timely care and privacy early on, establishes clear viability- and health-based standards later with explicit exceptions for rape, incest, and serious medical danger, and prioritizes consistent guidance for clinicians. Real common ground is strengthening prevention and support\u2014contraception access, honest education, healthcare, and resources for parenting\u2014so fewer people reach a point where any option feels impossible.",
    "Abortion law should reflect both the moral seriousness many attach to unborn life and the reality that pregnancy can involve urgent medical risks and complex circumstances. A durable framework protects timely, safe care with clear health exceptions while also setting transparent standards that people and clinicians can understand. Common ground grows when policy pairs any limits with prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, adoption options, and practical help for parents\u2014so fewer families face crisis decisions.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to reduce suffering by keeping patients safe and treating developing life with respect, without turning families in crisis or clinicians into criminals. That means clear, medically workable rules that include life-and-health protections and avoid political micromanagement of emergency care. The most shared path forward is prevention and support\u2014contraception access, honest education, and robust assistance for pregnancy, birth, and parenting\u2014so the choice is rarer and less coerced by hardship.",
    "Abortion policy should start from compassion: recognizing sincere convictions about protecting life while also honoring bodily autonomy and the need for evidence-based medical judgment. A balanced approach keeps early care legal and accessible, allows straightforward exceptions for serious health threats and violence, and sets later guardrails in clear clinical terms. Pairing the law with strong family supports and pregnancy prevention is the best way to lower abortions without increasing harm.",
    "Laws on abortion should be written to protect human dignity on all sides\u2014taking the value of potential life seriously while ensuring no one is forced into dangerous delays or one-size-fits-all outcomes. Clear standards, clinician-led decision-making in emergencies, and humane exceptions can reduce fear and confusion even amid moral disagreement. Investing in contraception, education, maternal healthcare, childcare, and adoption support is a practical way to prevent crises and make any legal compromise more just.",
    "Abortion laws should seek a workable peace between competing goods: safeguarding women\u2019s health and agency while recognizing a public interest in protecting developing life. The best compromise focuses on safe access early, well-defined medical exceptions throughout, and predictable limits that don\u2019t punish people acting in good faith. Prevention and real supports for parents\u2014healthcare, leave, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014are where shared values can become measurable results.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by both the dignity of the pregnant person and a serious respect for developing human life, written clearly enough that doctors can act quickly in medical emergencies. A durable approach protects health and safety with well-defined exceptions, while also investing in what prevents crisis pregnancies and supports families\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, adoption options, and practical help for parents. The goal should be fewer tragedies and less coercion, with policy shaped more by medical reality and compassion than by punishment or slogans.",
    "Abortion law should be grounded in compassion and realism: acknowledge the moral weight many attach to unborn life while protecting a person\u2019s ability to make time-sensitive medical decisions safely. Clear rules should prevent the hardest cases from turning into legal limbo, especially when health, rape, or severe complications are involved. Common ground grows when any legal limits are paired with serious prevention and support\u2014contraception, education, prenatal care, childcare, and adoption\u2014so fewer people feel cornered.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should prioritize reducing harm: safeguard patients\u2019 health and privacy, treat potential life with seriousness, and avoid one-size-fits-all mandates that ignore medical complexity. The most workable framework sets understandable boundaries with explicit medical exceptions, and focuses on making abortion less necessary by expanding contraception, sex education, and economic and healthcare support for families. People can disagree on where the line is and still agree the law should be humane, medically informed, and aimed at fewer crises.",
    "Abortion policy should reflect two truths at once: many view pregnancy as morally significant, and real pregnancies can bring urgent medical and personal realities that demand compassion. Whatever limits exist, they should be precise, include clear protections for life and health, and keep clinicians from being forced to guess in emergencies. At the same time, society should commit to preventing unwanted pregnancies and supporting parenting through education, contraception access, prenatal care, and practical family resources.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by a commitment to protect vulnerable life and to protect women from danger, stigma, and needless suffering, recognizing that these goals often overlap more than politics admits. A balanced approach keeps decision-making close to patients and clinicians early on, sets medically grounded guardrails later, and guarantees straightforward exceptions for health and extreme circumstances. Pairing any framework with prevention and support\u2014contraception, education, prenatal care, adoption, and childcare\u2014offers the best chance for fewer abortions and stronger families.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a shared commitment to dignity and preventing needless suffering: protecting a pregnant person\u2019s health and ability to get timely medical care, while also taking seriously the moral concern many feel for developing human life. A workable framework pairs clear, medically grounded rules and exceptions for life and serious health risks (and other tragic circumstances) with strong prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, adoption options, and practical help for parents\u2014so fewer people face crisis decisions in the first place.",
    "Abortion law should aim for principles most people can recognize even amid disagreement: compassion, medical safety, and responsibility toward both women and potential life. That means keeping urgent decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians with clear protections for emergencies, while also setting predictable guardrails that reflect the increasing moral stakes later in pregnancy. The surest common ground is investing in prevention and family support so the law reduces crises instead of adding punishment and fear.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by humility about how complex pregnancies can be, and by a desire to protect life without sacrificing health, privacy, or fairness. A balanced approach provides early, safe access; clear, enforceable exceptions when a patient\u2019s life or serious health is at risk; and later-pregnancy standards grounded in medical evidence rather than politics. Pairing any legal limits with contraception access, comprehensive education, and robust support for parents and adoption makes fewer abortions a realistic goal instead of a slogan.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by harm reduction: minimize preventable deaths, trauma, and lifelong hardship while respecting that many view fetal life as morally significant. The law can do this by ensuring safe, timely care and clear medical exceptions, and by encouraging earlier decisions through accurate information and access\u2014not criminalization. At the same time, broad support for families, childcare, prenatal care, and adoption can make choosing to carry a pregnancy more feasible.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by two duties held in tension\u2014care for the person who is pregnant and concern for developing life\u2014so rules must be medically workable, compassionate, and consistent. Protecting health and emergency care should be non-negotiable, and any limits should be paired with prevention and real material support that reduces unwanted pregnancies and strengthens families. When policy prioritizes safety, clarity, and support over ideology, people with different moral starting points can still agree the system is more humane."
