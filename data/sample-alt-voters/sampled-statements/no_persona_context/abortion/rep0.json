    "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, science, and respect for conscience: protecting timely access to safe care while allowing carefully defined exceptions for rape, incest, nonviable pregnancies, and threats to a pregnant person\u2019s health.

    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for personal autonomy and medical judgment, prioritizing patient safety and timely care while allowing narrowly tailored exceptions for grave circumstances. They should focus on reducing unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and social supports so fewer people face crisis choices.",
    "Policy should keep deeply personal decisions between patients and clinicians guided by medical evidence and compassion, while recognizing the moral seriousness many attach to fetal life and allowing clear exceptions in cases of risk, rape, incest, or fatal fetal conditions. At the same time society should invest in prevention and support\u2014affordable healthcare, prenatal care, and resources for parents\u2014to reduce the need for abortion and protect families.",
    "A fair legal framework will protect health, privacy, and conscience by grounding limits in medical evidence and preserving access to emergency and time-sensitive care, while also affirming the value many place on unborn life. It should pursue common goals\u2014reducing harm through contraception, education, and material support\u2014so choices are less often driven by crisis.",
    "Abortion laws should be crafted to minimize harm: safeguarding patient autonomy and clinician judgment for timely medical decisions, providing clear, narrowly defined exceptions for severe cases, and avoiding criminalization that disproportionately hurts the vulnerable. Complementing legal standards with strong prevention and family supports\u2014sex education, contraception, prenatal and childcare assistance\u2014creates shared ground and better outcomes for women, children, and communities.",
    "Good policy recognizes both the moral concerns about fetal life and the realities people face by combining respectful, evidence-based limits with compassion and practical supports; decisions should remain rooted in medical judgment and individual circumstances rather than political punishment. By prioritizing prevention, healthcare access, and resources for parents, the law can reduce suffering and build consensus across divided views.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for individual autonomy by centering timely, evidence-based medical care and clear exceptions for emergencies, rape, incest, and nonviable pregnancies. Paired with robust prevention and supports\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and material help for parents\u2014this approach reduces harm and preserves dignity for everyone affected.",
    "Policy should keep difficult medical decisions between patients and qualified clinicians while recognizing the sincere moral convictions many hold about fetal life and providing room for conscience. At the same time, the law ought to expand prevention and supports\u2014access to contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and economic assistance\u2014so fewer people face heartbreaking choices.",
    "A fair legal framework protects health, privacy, and patient autonomy early in pregnancy, allows clearly defined, medically grounded limits later on, and ensures exceptions for life\u2011threatening situations, rape, incest, and severe fetal anomalies. Complementing rules with non\u2011punitive supports\u2014education, contraception, adoption services, and family resources\u2014builds common ground and reduces the need for abortion.",
    "Laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for differing moral views, aiming to reduce harm rather than to punish while safeguarding emergency and time\u2011sensitive care and deferring to clinicians\u2019 expertise. By investing in prevention and supports that make parenting viable\u2014healthcare, childcare, and economic assistance\u2014society can diminish crises and honor both conscience and dignity.",
    "Reasonable abortion policy reconciles concern for unborn life with the realities of women\u2019s health and autonomy by grounding limits in medical evidence, protecting privacy, and ensuring clear exceptions for emergencies and severe hardship. Paired with vigorous prevention\u2014sex education, contraception\u2014and tangible support for parents and families, this approach reduces suffering and creates a pragmatic, humane consensus."
