    "Laws on abortion should balance compassion, medical evidence, and respect for both bodily autonomy and the moral weight many place on potential life, keeping urgent decisions between patients and qualified clinicians rather than politicians. Practical policy focuses on protecting health and privacy, allowing narrowly defined exceptions for life-threatening situations, rape, incest, and severe fetal anomalies, while investing in prevention\u2014comprehensive sex education, accessible contraception\u2014and robust supports for prenatal care and families so fewer people face desperate choices.",
    "Reasonable law recognizes that pregnancy raises competing legitimate concerns: a pregnant person\u2019s autonomy and health, and the value many assign to unborn life; policy should therefore protect timely, evidence-based medical care while allowing carefully defined exceptions later in gestation. To reduce conflict and harm, the state should prioritize prevention through contraception and education and expand social supports\u2014healthcare, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014so choices are made from stability rather than crisis.",
    "Good abortion policy centers safety, dignity, and fairness by grounding limits in medical reality, safeguarding privacy and clinician judgment, and ensuring exceptions for serious health risks, rape, incest, and nonviable pregnancies. At the same time it reduces the need for abortion through accessible contraception, sex education, and meaningful support for parents, aiming to lower suffering rather than deepen political division.",
    "Law should strike a humane middle ground: protect access to timely, safe care early in pregnancy and in medical emergencies, set clear evidence-based guardrails as pregnancy advances, and avoid criminalization or coercion. Complementing legal rules with investments in prevention and family supports\u2014affordable healthcare, prenatal and mental-health services, and economic assistance\u2014creates shared progress toward fewer unwanted pregnancies and healthier families.",
    "Effective policy treats abortion as a health and social issue by combining respect for individual conscience and bodily autonomy with concern for potential life, guided by medical evidence and empathy for real-life circumstances. Clear, enforceable standards and narrow exceptions should be paired with robust prevention and postnatal supports so people can make choices from strength and support rather than fear or deprivation.",
    "Laws should balance respect for potential life with respect for bodily autonomy by centering timely, evidence-based medical care and keeping urgent decisions between patients and clinicians. Clear, narrowly defined protections for health and for cases of rape, incest, or severe fetal anomaly can coexist with robust investments in contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and family supports that reduce crisis pregnancies. This approach treats people with dignity, minimizes harm, and focuses policy on practical outcomes rather than punishment or ideology.",
    "Policy should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and personal conscience: protect safe, timely access to care early in pregnancy while allowing narrowly tailored exceptions later for serious health risks or trauma.

They should include clear, narrowly defined exceptions for serious health risks and sexual violence, and be paired with robust prevention and family supports\u2014comprehensive sex education, accessible contraception, prenatal care, and economic help\u2014so fewer people face desperate choices.",
    "Policy should balance respect for bodily autonomy with compassion for unborn life by keeping time-sensitive medical choices between patients and clinicians and establishing transparent, evidence-based limits tied to health and viability. At the same time, laws should fund prevention and postnatal supports\u2014education, contraception, childcare, and mental-health services\u2014so that fewer pregnancies become crises that force wrenching decisions.",
    "Effective abortion law protects patient safety, privacy, and timely access to care while recognizing differing moral views by allowing narrowly tailored exceptions for life-threatening conditions, rape, incest, and severe fetal anomalies. It should be complemented by strong investments in prevention and parent supports so that legal rules reduce harm rather than punish people or clinicians.",
    "Laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for conscience, keeping decisions as much as possible in the hands of patients and medical professionals and providing clear exceptions for serious health emergencies. Complementary public investments\u2014affordable contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and support for families\u2014can bridge moral disagreements by reducing the circumstances that drive people to consider abortion.",

    "Reasonable law recognizes both the moral weight many assign to unborn life and the urgent need to protect a pregnant person\u2019s wellbeing, using clear, evidence-based guardrails tied to fetal development and health risks. Those guardrails should include exceptions for life-threatening or traumatic circumstances and be coupled with practical measures that reduce unintended pregnancies and support families.",
    "A durable approach treats abortion policy as a public-health challenge rather than a culture-war prize: protect timely, safe access in medically necessary cases, restrict where there is broad ethical consensus, and ensure consistent, enforceable standards. Complementing any legal limits with accessible contraception, comprehensive sex education, and strong prenatal and parental support will lower the number of abortions and ease moral tensions.",

    "Sound abortion law focuses on reducing harm: protect timely access to safe care, uphold patient privacy and informed consent, and allow narrowly defined exceptions when the pregnant person\u2019s health or severe fetal conditions are at stake. At the same time, public policy should expand contraception, education, prenatal and childcare supports so fewer families are forced into crisis.",
    "Policy should keep pregnancy decisions as close as possible to patients and medical professionals, grounded in science and compassion, while acknowledging the sincere ethical concerns many hold about nascent life. Combine clear, enforceable standards for later gestation and emergencies with robust programs\u2014family healthcare, adoption services, and economic supports\u2014to minimize desperate choices and respect diverse convictions.",
    "Laws should aim for a humane middle ground: protect individual autonomy and timely medical care early in pregnancy, provide compassionate, narrow exceptions for grave health risks, rape, and incest, and avoid criminalizing care or clinicians. Complement legal rules with prevention and support\u2014accessible contraception, sex education, prenatal care, and resources for parents\u2014so policy reduces harm and honors differing moral perspectives.",
    "Laws should protect health and dignity by grounding decisions in medical evidence and the patient\u2013clinician relationship while respecting both bodily autonomy and the moral concern many feel for prenatal life. Practical limits and narrowly defined exceptions for serious health risks, rape, or incest should be paired with robust prevention and support\u2014accessible contraception, sex education, prenatal care, and family resources\u2014to reduce crises without criminalizing people or clinicians.",
    "Policy ought to balance respect for personal medical decision\u2011making with recognition of the moral weight some attach to potential life, keeping government out of urgent clinical care and ensuring clear, compassionate exceptions for serious threats to health. At the same time, investments in contraception, education, and supports for parents can reduce unwanted pregnancies and build common ground across differing convictions.",
    "A fair legal approach centers on reducing harm: protect timely, private access to safe care grounded in science and clinician judgment, allow narrowly tailored exceptions where health or severe fetal conditions are involved, and avoid punitive enforcement. Complementing rules with strong social supports\u2014affordable healthcare, prenatal and postnatal services, and adoption resources\u2014helps prevent the dire circumstances that make abortion feel like the only option.",
    "Good laws should prioritize safety, privacy, and compassion by trusting medical professionals and respecting individual conscience, while acknowledging widespread concern for unborn life through measured, transparent limits tied to health risks and viability. Pairing any legal framework with expanded contraception, comprehensive sex education, and meaningful support for families creates fewer crises and more shared solutions.",
    "Effective policy bridges differing views by protecting the pregnant person\u2019s health and autonomy, recognizing the moral seriousness many attach to pregnancy, and setting clear, evidence\u2011based exceptions for life\u2011threatening or traumatic circumstances. To reduce the need for abortion and build consensus, laws should be matched with prevention and care\u2014accessible contraception, education, prenatal supports, and economic assistance for parents\u2014rather than punishment."
