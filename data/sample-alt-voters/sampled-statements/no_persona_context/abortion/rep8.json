    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for human life with respect for personal autonomy by centering medical evidence, patient safety, and timely clinician judgment while providing narrowly tailored exceptions for life\u2011threatening situations, rape, and severe fetal anomalies. At the same time policy should invest in prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and meaningful resources for parenting or adoption\u2014so choices are made from care and stability rather than crisis. Clear, consistent rules that avoid criminalizing patients or clinicians and that prioritize compassion and practical help can reduce conflict and protect the wellbeing of families and communities.",
    "Good law on abortion should protect patients\u2019 health and privacy, rely on sound medical standards, and acknowledge the moral seriousness many attach to prenatal life by allowing narrowly defined exceptions in urgent or tragic cases. Simultaneously, public policy should reduce unwanted pregnancies through education and contraception and support parents with accessible healthcare, childcare, and adoption services so fewer people face desperate choices. Grounding rules in clarity, compassion, and enforceability keeps decisions close to families and clinicians while minimizing political intrusion.",
    "Policy on abortion should seek common ground by valuing both the dignity of potential life and the autonomy and health of pregnant people, using evidence\u2011based medical thresholds and clear exceptions to protect those in crisis. It should couple any limits with robust prevention and support\u2014sex education, contraception access, prenatal care, mental\u2011health services, and assistance for families and adoptive paths\u2014so choices are not driven by hardship. Laws that are precise, humane, and nonpunitive foster trust and reduce harm across diverse communities.",

    "Good law should treat both the unborn and the pregnant person with dignity by combining clear protections for health and narrow exceptions in tragic or dangerous cases with strong social supports that make carrying a pregnancy viable. Focusing on prevention, timely medical care, and nonpunitive assistance\u2014mental health, childcare, prenatal care, and adoption resources\u2014creates shared ground that respects conscience while minimizing avoidable abortions.",
    "Policy should be guided by compassion, scientific standards, and respect for differing moral views: protect access to safe, timely medical care and privacy, allow narrowly defined exceptions for severe health risks and trauma, and avoid criminal penalties for patients or clinicians. Complement legal boundaries with investments in contraception, education, and economic and parenting supports so fewer families are forced into irreversible choices out of desperation.",
    "Abridging approach to abortion law affirms the moral seriousness of potential life while prioritizing patient safety and medical judgment, establishing clear, enforceable limits and exceptions for urgent health, rape, incest, and nonviable pregnancies. By coupling those standards with robust prevention and support\u2014sex education, accessible contraception, prenatal care, and adoption or parenting assistance\u2014policy can reduce conflict and the number of abortions through compassion and practical help.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for individual autonomy by grounding policy in medical evidence, protecting patient safety and privacy, and keeping time\u2011sensitive decisions primarily between patients and qualified clinicians. Reasonable, clearly defined exceptions for serious health risks, rape, and incest should coexist with investments in prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, childcare, and adoption services\u2014so fewer people face crisis choices. Clear, enforceable rules that avoid criminalizing care and prioritize dignity can create space for differing moral convictions while reducing harm.",
    "A fair legal approach treats abortion as a public\u2011health issue that honors both the moral seriousness many attach to prenatal life and the lived realities of people facing complex pregnancies, centering policies on evidence, compassion, and clear medical standards. Laws should protect access in emergencies and for severe fetal or maternal conditions, include narrowly tailored exceptions, and be paired with robust prevention and family supports\u2014education, contraception, healthcare, and economic assistance\u2014so choices are less driven by crisis. By keeping politics out of the exam room and focusing on prevention and care, society can reduce abortions while respecting conscience and dignity.",
    "Policy should seek common ground by protecting health, privacy, and timely medical care while recognizing the moral weight many people place on unborn life; this means clear, evidence\u2011based limits and narrowly drawn exceptions for life\u2011threatening situations, rape, or incest. At the same time, laws must be coupled with meaningful supports\u2014accessible contraception, honest sex education, prenatal and child care, and adoption resources\u2014so fewer families are forced into heartbreaking decisions and no one is punished for seeking care. Emphasizing prevention, accountability, and compassion can bridge deep disagreements.",
    "Good policy balances respect for conscience and potential life with respect for bodily autonomy by anchoring laws in medical judgment, clear standards, and protection for patient privacy. It should avoid criminalization, allow narrowly defined exceptions for severe medical and traumatic circumstances, and invest in prevention and supports\u2014contraception, education, healthcare, and economic assistance\u2014so that choosing to carry a pregnancy is feasible for families who want to. Focused, humane rules that reduce harm and expand care can unite people with divergent beliefs.",
    "Abortion laws should be practical and compassionate: rooted in scientific evidence and patient safety, respectful of diverse moral views, and designed to minimize harm by keeping decisions between clinicians and patients rather than politicians. They should provide clear exceptions for emergencies and serious trauma, avoid punitive enforcement, and be matched with robust prevention and family support programs\u2014education, contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and adoption services\u2014so fewer people face impossible choices. Such an approach upholds dignity, reduces conflict, and prioritizes real\u2011world outcomes.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with protection of patients\u2019 health and autonomy, anchoring any limits in sound medical evidence and clear, enforceable standards. They should include narrowly tailored exceptions for rape, incest, and serious maternal or fetal health risks, avoid criminalizing patients or clinicians, and pair restrictions with robust prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, contraception access, prenatal care, and resources for parents\u2014so choices are made from stability rather than crisis.",
    "Policy should keep time-sensitive healthcare decisions primarily between patients and clinicians while recognizing the sincere moral concerns many hold about unborn life. To find common ground, laws should protect timely access to necessary care, allow narrowly defined exceptions for emergencies and traumatic cases, and invest in prevention and family supports that reduce unintended pregnancies and help families thrive.",
    "A humane legal framework treats abortion as a healthcare matter centered on patient safety, privacy, and clinical judgment while acknowledging moral concerns by protecting developing life where feasible. It should minimize political interference, provide exceptions for dire medical and traumatic circumstances, and expand contraception, education, and support services so fewer people are forced into desperate choices.",
    "Laws should aim to reduce abortions through prevention and support rather than punishment, combining clear medical standards with compassion for the complex realities families face. That means protecting emergency and medically necessary care, creating narrow exceptions for rape, incest, and serious health threats, and investing in contraception, prenatal care, childcare, and adoption services so more pregnancies are carried to term by choice, not necessity.",
    "Legislation should respect both the dignity of potential life and the rights and wellbeing of pregnant people, using evidence-based medical thresholds and predictable, transparent rules. By preserving access to timely care, allowing narrow exceptions for severe hardship or health risk, and committing resources to prevention and family support, the law can reduce conflict while helping families and clinicians make humane, practical decisions."
