    "Laws on abortion should be guided by a commitment to reduce harm: protecting patients\u2019 health and privacy, respecting the moral seriousness many attach to fetal life, and keeping urgent medical decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians. A workable framework pairs clear, medically grounded rules and exceptions for emergencies and profound hardship with strong prevention and support\u2014education, contraception, prenatal care, adoption options, and resources for parents\u2014so fewer families face crisis choices.",
    "Abortion laws should reflect both compassion for people facing time-sensitive medical and family crises and a serious respect for developing human life. The most durable approach sets clear, evidence-based standards that protect access to safe care and allow physicians to act in emergencies, while investing heavily in contraception, sex education, prenatal care, and economic support so fewer pregnancies become desperate dilemmas.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim for humility and practicality: minimize government intrusion into early, private medical decisions while recognizing broader public concern about later pregnancy. Clear, clinician-written safeguards\u2014especially for threats to life or health, rape or incest, and catastrophic fetal conditions\u2014should be matched with real support for parenting and adoption and with prevention efforts that reduce unintended pregnancy.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by shared goals most people hold at once: fewer unintended pregnancies, fewer tragedies, and more support for families. That means rules grounded in medical evidence and human dignity, protecting timely care and privacy, and pairing any limits with robust contraception access, accurate education, prenatal and mental health care, and practical help that makes choosing to carry a pregnancy realistic.",
    "Laws on abortion should prioritize patient safety and informed consent while acknowledging that communities differ on when fetal life deserves legal protection. A balanced path is clear, consistent standards that preserve medical judgment in emergencies and avoid criminalizing crisis decisions, alongside strong investments in prevention and family supports so fewer people feel coerced by poverty, fear, or lack of care.",

    "Abortion laws should aim for a humane balance that respects bodily autonomy and medical reality while also taking seriously the belief that unborn life has moral value. That means clear standards written with doctors\u2019 input, strong protections for life- and health-threatening situations, and investments in contraception, prenatal care, childcare, and economic supports so decisions aren\u2019t driven by desperation.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by dignity and compassion for everyone involved, recognizing that pregnancies can be joyful, tragic, or medically dangerous, often all at once. Common ground comes from keeping care safe and timely, setting transparent guardrails and exceptions that reflect medical evidence, and strengthening the supports that prevent unintended pregnancy and make raising a child genuinely possible.",
    "A durable abortion policy should be grounded in medical evidence and the goal of fewer tragedies: protect a pregnant person\u2019s safety and the clinician\u2019s ability to act in emergencies, while recognizing many citizens\u2019 conviction that fetal life merits protection. Pairing any limits with prevention, adoption options, and practical help for parents can reduce abortions without criminalizing families in crisis.",
    "Abortion laws should be guided less by punishment and more by responsibility: clear, enforceable rules that safeguard health and reflect society\u2019s interest in potential life, with room for urgent, complex cases. The best chance at shared agreement is coupling legal standards with broad access to contraception, honest education, and strong supports for pregnancy and parenting so fewer people are forced into impossible choices.",

That means clear, medically grounded rules with robust exceptions for life and serious health threats, paired with strong investments in contraception, prenatal care, and economic supports that make parenting feasible. A stable compromise avoids punishment-driven policy and focuses on reducing crises and improving outcomes for children and communities.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by humility about hard cases and by a commitment to safeguard both personal liberty and society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life. Policy can do this by ensuring early, safe access and privacy, allowing carefully defined limits later with strong exceptions for medical emergencies and severe circumstances, and expanding practical supports that reduce desperation. Common ground grows when prevention and family resources are treated as central, not optional.",
    "Good abortion law should prioritize patient safety and medical judgment while acknowledging that many citizens view fetal life as morally meaningful and want it treated with seriousness. The most durable approach combines predictable standards and emergency flexibility with prevention\u2014education and contraception\u2014and with concrete help for those who carry pregnancies to term, including prenatal care, childcare, and adoption services. The measure of success should be fewer unintended pregnancies, fewer dangerous delays in care, and more supported families.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by a commitment to reduce harm: protect a pregnant person\u2019s health and autonomy, respect conscientious disagreement, and recognize that late-pregnancy decisions are often rare and medically complex. Clear rules written with clinicians\u2019 input, real exceptions for threats to life and serious health, and investments in contraception and family support can lower abortion rates without criminalizing people in crisis. Whatever the legal line, the public responsibility is to make fewer people face this decision under fear, poverty, or lack of care.",

A workable framework pairs clear, medically grounded rules and exceptions for emergencies with robust prevention and support\u2014sex education, contraception, prenatal care, adoption options, and help for parents\u2014so fewer families face crisis choices. The goal is compassion and accountability without turning patients or clinicians into criminals.",
    "Abortion law should start from shared responsibilities: safeguarding health and dignity, respecting sincere moral convictions about fetal life, and keeping decisions as close as possible to patients and qualified clinicians. Clear standards should include reliable exceptions for life- and health-threatening situations, rape or incest, and nonviable pregnancies, while also investing heavily in contraception, education, prenatal care, and economic supports that make parenting feasible. Policy that is consistent, evidence-based, and focused on prevention can lower polarization and reduce suffering.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by both compassion for people facing time-sensitive medical and family crises and a serious respect for the value many place on unborn life. That means clear, enforceable rules written with medical expertise, strong protections for emergencies, and limits that avoid sweeping criminalization. Common ground grows when government also expands prevention and practical support\u2014contraception, sex education, prenatal care, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014so choices are less driven by desperation.",
    "Abortion policy should aim for dignity and clarity: protecting safe medical care and personal conscience while recognizing that communities disagree about when legal protection for fetal life should begin. A durable approach sets medically informed timelines with firm exceptions for serious health risks and catastrophic pregnancy complications, and it avoids punitive enforcement that deters emergency care. Pairing any legal framework with strong prevention and family supports can reduce unwanted pregnancies and make outcomes better for parents and children alike.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by the twin goals of protecting life and preventing needless suffering, recognizing that pregnancy can involve both moral conviction and urgent medical reality. The most workable compromise keeps care safe and accessible early, guarantees swift action in emergencies, and provides transparent standards for later cases grounded in medical evidence. At the same time, it strengthens the supports that reduce abortions in the first place\u2014education, contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and resources for families.",

    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a shared commitment to life, health, and fairness: protect a pregnant person\u2019s safety and autonomy while taking seriously the ethical concerns many hold about fetal life. Durable policy sets clear rules with strong medical exceptions, and it couples any legal framework with prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and resources for parents.",
    "Good abortion policy should start from compassion and evidence, recognizing that pregnancy can involve both profound moral conviction and unpredictable medical risk.

    "Laws on abortion should be guided by protecting vulnerable people on all sides\u2014women facing crisis and the developing life many communities want to defend\u2014without turning private tragedy into a criminal spectacle. The most common ground comes from clear, clinician-written standards with exceptions for serious health threats and violence, alongside prevention and family support that lowers abortion rates by making it easier to avoid unintended pregnancy and to raise children when people choose.",
    "Laws on abortion should start from a shared commitment to human dignity: protecting a pregnant person\u2019s health and privacy while taking seriously the moral value many attach to developing life. A workable framework keeps urgent medical decisions in the patient\u2013clinician relationship, sets clear and clinically grounded rules with compassionate exceptions for hard cases, and avoids criminalizing people in crisis. Common ground grows when policy also reduces unwanted pregnancies and hardship through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and real support for parents and adoption.",
    "Abortion law should be guided less by punishment and more by reducing harm\u2014through clear, medically informed standards that protect patient safety and allow timely care when serious risks or trauma are involved. At the same time, it can acknowledge moral concerns about fetal life by encouraging earlier decision-making, informed consent, and meaningful limits later in pregnancy with well-defined exceptions. Broad investments in contraception, education, prenatal care, and family supports can help prevent crises and make fewer people face this choice at all.",
    "Abortion policy should reflect two widely held values: respect for bodily autonomy and a desire to protect vulnerable life, especially as pregnancy progresses. That points toward laws written with medical expertise that safeguard privacy, guarantee emergency and health-related care, and set understandable boundaries that communities can actually follow. Pairing any legal framework with strong prevention and support\u2014contraception, sex education, healthcare, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014offers the best chance to lower abortions without deepening suffering.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and the recognition that families differ deeply on moral and religious questions. A durable approach limits government intrusion in early, time-sensitive care, ensures clear exceptions for threats to life and serious health complications, and treats clinicians and patients with dignity rather than suspicion.

That can include protecting access to safe care and privacy, while setting carefully defined limits later in pregnancy that include humane exceptions for medical emergencies and severe circumstances. Preventing unintended pregnancies and supporting those who carry to term\u2014through education, contraception, prenatal care, and economic help\u2014can be the shared foundation even amid moral disagreement.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by protecting health and human dignity in real, time-sensitive situations, while acknowledging that many citizens see developing life as morally significant. A workable framework keeps medical decisions primarily between patients and qualified clinicians, includes clear emergency and violence-related exceptions, and avoids criminalizing people acting in good faith. At the same time, it commits serious public resources to prevention and support\u2014accurate sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, adoption services, and economic help for families\u2014so fewer pregnancies become crises.",
    "Abortion law should aim to reduce suffering and protect life by grounding rules in medical evidence, due process, and compassion rather than ideology. Common ground is possible when policy safeguards timely care and privacy, sets transparent standards for later pregnancy that doctors can apply, and provides clear exceptions when health, viability, or violence is at issue. Pairing any legal limits with strong supports for parenting and prevention can move the debate from punishment to practical help.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a commitment to both bodily autonomy and the serious moral questions many attach to fetal life, recognizing that people of good faith disagree on where lines should be drawn. The most durable approach uses clear, clinician-informed rules that protect patients and providers in emergencies and severe circumstances, while preventing political micromanagement of medical care. Broad investments in contraception, sex education, prenatal care, childcare, and adoption support can help families choose freely and reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by the goal of fewer tragedies: protecting a pregnant person\u2019s health and freedom to make medical decisions, while also reflecting society\u2019s interest in protecting developing life as pregnancy progresses. That means early, safe access; clearly defined limits later that are tied to medical realities; and explicit exceptions for threats to life or serious health, rape or incest, and nonviable pregnancies.

    "Laws on abortion should be shaped by compassion and practicality, accepting that pregnancy can involve moral conviction, medical risk, and economic pressure all at once. A bridging approach protects patient safety and privacy, trusts medical judgment in urgent cases, and sets consistent rules that neither force one doctrine on everyone nor ignore widely held concerns about potential life.

    "Laws on abortion should start from shared goals: protecting health and dignity, taking moral concerns about developing life seriously, and keeping decisions as grounded in medical reality as possible. A workable framework offers clear, evidence-based rules and well-defined exceptions for emergencies and extreme circumstances, while avoiding criminalizing patients or clinicians acting in good faith. At the same time, it invests heavily in prevention and support\u2014accurate sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and resources for parenting and adoption\u2014so fewer people face this decision in crisis.",
    "Abortion law should be written with humility about complex pregnancies, prioritizing patient safety, privacy, and timely access to competent medical care while recognizing that many citizens view fetal life as morally significant. Common ground is strongest when any legal boundaries are clear, medically informed, and include robust exceptions for serious health threats and violence, rather than vague rules that delay care. Policy should also commit to reducing unwanted pregnancies and hardship through contraception access, comprehensive education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real economic support for families.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to reduce harm in the real world: protect a pregnant person\u2019s health and autonomy, acknowledge sincere moral convictions about unborn life, and keep politicians from overriding medical judgment in urgent situations. A durable compromise sets transparent standards with exceptions for life and serious health risks, rape or incest, and nonviable or catastrophic fetal conditions, without turning private crises into criminal cases.

    "Abortion policy should reflect both compassion and responsibility by ensuring safe, evidence-based care and recognizing the ethical weight many attach to potential life, especially later in pregnancy. Clear rules should protect emergency treatment and allow clinicians to act without fear, while encouraging informed consent and respectful counseling rather than stigma. Beyond legality, government should focus on what lowers abortion rates without coercion: contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and practical support for raising children.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by a commitment to human dignity: safeguarding health and medical privacy, respecting moral diversity, and seeking fewer tragedies rather than political victories. That means clear, medically grounded protections for early access and for hard cases where health, safety, or viability are at stake, alongside reasonable guardrails that avoid punishing people in crisis. The most unifying step is pairing any legal approach with prevention and support\u2014education, contraception, prenatal care, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014so families have real options.",

That means clear, medically grounded rules with firm protections for emergency care and serious health risks, written so doctors can act without fear and patients are not criminalized. Common ground grows when policy also expands contraception, comprehensive education, prenatal care, and economic supports that make parenting a real option.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and humility about how varied pregnancy circumstances can be. A workable compromise protects safe, timely care and privacy, recognizes stronger state interests later in pregnancy with carefully defined exceptions, and avoids turning patients and clinicians into targets. At the same time, communities can reduce abortions by funding prevention, prenatal and postpartum care, adoption services, and practical support for families.",
    "Good abortion policy should prioritize preventing harm: safeguarding a pregnant person\u2019s health, respecting moral pluralism, and treating potential life with seriousness without forcing a single belief on everyone. Clear rules should preserve clinician judgment in emergencies and ensure access doesn\u2019t depend on wealth or geography, while allowing narrowly tailored limits that are tied to medical realities. Pairing any legal framework with contraception access, sex education, and strong family supports is the most credible route to fewer unwanted pregnancies and fewer tragedies.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by the principle that difficult, time-sensitive health decisions belong as close as possible to patients and qualified clinicians, yet society may set careful guardrails to reflect concern for developing life. The best chance at stability is clear, enforceable standards with exceptions for life and serious health threats, rape or incest, and catastrophic fetal conditions, alongside protections against stigma and coercion. Prevention and support\u2014education, contraception, prenatal care, paid leave, and childcare\u2014should be treated as central, not optional.",

    "Abortion laws should be guided by a commitment to reduce suffering: safeguarding safe, evidence-based care and preserving room for medical judgment when pregnancies become dangerous or unviable. At the same time, they can reflect the value many place on unborn life by setting clear limits later in pregnancy and pairing any legal boundaries with strong supports that make choosing to carry a pregnancy realistic. The most durable approach focuses on prevention, practical help for families, and dignity for everyone rather than punishment or partisan control.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should start from shared goals\u2014protecting health, respecting conscience, and reducing the number of desperate situations\u2014rather than trying to force one moral view on all citizens. That means keeping early care safe and accessible, writing clear exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to life or health, and ensuring clinicians can act quickly in emergencies.

Clear, enforceable rules can allow early access and define narrow, clinician-informed boundaries later in pregnancy, with unambiguous exceptions for health emergencies and pregnancies resulting from violence. Common ground grows when policy also expands contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, childcare, and economic supports that make choosing to carry a pregnancy realistic.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should reflect a pluralistic society by avoiding one-size-fits-all mandates and instead prioritizing evidence-based medicine, informed consent, and compassion for real-life circumstances.

    "Laws concerning abortion should start from shared goals: protecting health, reducing preventable suffering, and respecting the seriousness of the decision for those who see profound moral value in unborn life and for those who prioritize bodily autonomy. A workable framework keeps urgent medical judgment and patient privacy at the center, sets clear and clinically grounded standards for later pregnancies, and includes narrowly tailored exceptions for life-threatening or traumatic circumstances. Lasting policy also invests heavily in prevention and support\u2014contraception, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, adoption services, and economic help\u2014so fewer people face this choice under pressure.",
    "Abortion laws should be guided less by punishment and more by measurable care: safer pregnancies, fewer unintended pregnancies, and clearer rules that doctors can follow in real emergencies. That means protecting timely access to evidence-based medical care and privacy, while also acknowledging society\u2019s interest in protecting developing life through reasonable, medically informed limits as pregnancy advances. Common ground grows when any legal framework is paired with practical supports\u2014contraception, sex education, prenatal care, paid leave, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014so choices are not driven by desperation.",
    "Laws on abortion should reflect a pluralistic society by safeguarding a pregnant person\u2019s health and decision-making with qualified clinicians while taking seriously the moral convictions many hold about fetal life. Clear, enforceable standards should include robust exceptions for threats to life or serious health, and avoid criminalizing patients or physicians acting in good faith. The strongest consensus comes from pairing whatever limits exist with prevention and family support\u2014education, contraception, prenatal care, and resources for parenting\u2014so fewer pregnancies become crises.",
    "Abortion policy should aim for the broadest agreement: protect people from medical harm, respect conscience differences, and reduce the number of situations where abortion feels like the only option. That requires keeping emergency care and clinical judgment unobstructed, providing early and safe access where legal, and defining later-pregnancy rules in ways tied to medical reality rather than politics. At the same time, communities should commit to prevention and support\u2014contraception, comprehensive education, prenatal care, and real help for parents and adoption\u2014so the law is not the only \u201csupport system.\u201d",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion and clarity: compassion for people facing complex pregnancies and clarity that reflects both medical evidence and the widely felt responsibility to protect vulnerable life. A balanced approach keeps decisions close to patients and clinicians, includes exceptions for severe medical situations and violence, and sets transparent standards that reduce fear and confusion for providers. Common ground is strengthened when policy also expands contraception, honest education, prenatal and mental health care, and practical support for raising children.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by a commitment to reduce harm in the real world: protect a pregnant person\u2019s health and dignity, respect the moral concern many have for developing life, and keep urgent medical decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians. A workable framework pairs clear, medically grounded rules and exceptions for emergencies and extreme circumstances with strong prevention and support\u2014accurate sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, adoption options, and economic help for parents. The aim should be fewer crises and fewer abortions through practical help, not stigma or political punishment.",
    "Abortion law should start from shared goals\u2014health, safety, and human dignity\u2014while acknowledging that citizens disagree in good faith about when legal protection for fetal life should begin. Policy can protect timely, evidence-based care and privacy, set transparent standards that account for later-pregnancy complexity, and include clear exceptions so doctors can act in emergencies without fear. The most durable approach also invests heavily in prevention and family support so fewer people reach this decision under pressure.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion and medical reality, recognizing both the autonomy of the pregnant person and the moral seriousness many attach to unborn life. That means clear, clinically informed guardrails with unambiguous protections for life-threatening complications, rape or incest, and nonviable pregnancies, rather than vague rules that invite delay and harm. At the same time, communities should commit resources to contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, childcare, and adoption so choosing birth is genuinely supported.",
    "Good abortion policy should aim less at winning a culture war and more at creating conditions where fewer people face desperate choices: strong prevention, strong support for parents, and healthcare that is safe and timely. It should respect conscience and pluralism by not forcing one moral view on everyone, while still reflecting a public interest in protecting life through reasonable, workable limits and clear medical exceptions. When the law prioritizes dignity, clarity, and social support, it reduces both suffering and conflict.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by the principle that no one benefits from uncertainty in crisis\u2014patients need safe access, clinicians need clear standards, and society needs policies that actually reduce unwanted pregnancies. A middle path protects early, private medical decision-making, allows carefully defined limits later with strong health-based exceptions, and avoids criminalizing patients or good-faith medical care. Pairing any legal framework with contraception access, comprehensive education, prenatal care, and family assistance is the most practical way to honor both freedom and the value many place on potential life.",
    "Laws on abortion should start from a shared duty to protect life and prevent needless suffering, recognizing both the moral significance many place on fetal life and the medical reality that pregnancy can involve urgent, deeply personal risks. A workable framework keeps emergency care and serious health cases firmly in the hands of patients and clinicians, sets transparent standards the public can understand, and avoids turning families or doctors into criminals for good-faith decisions. Common ground grows when policy also reduces crisis pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and real economic support for parents and adoption.",
    "Abortion law should be guided by compassion and practical outcomes: safeguarding a pregnant person\u2019s health and privacy while taking seriously the belief that developing life deserves protection, especially as pregnancy progresses. Clear, medically grounded rules\u2014written with clinicians\u2019 input\u2014can pair access and urgent exceptions with reasonable guardrails, without forcing one moral doctrine on everyone. The strongest agreement point is prevention and support: contraception, accurate education, prenatal care, and resources that make carrying a pregnancy to term a real option.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to reduce harm and preserve dignity by keeping time-sensitive medical decisions close to the patient\u2013doctor relationship, not political punishment. At the same time, they should reflect that many citizens view fetal life as morally meaningful, which calls for clear standards and careful limits later in pregnancy alongside robust exceptions for health, violence, and nonviable conditions. Investing in prevention and family support\u2014contraception, education, healthcare, leave, and childcare\u2014offers the widest common ground and reduces the number of people facing this decision.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by two commitments people often share even when they disagree: protecting vulnerable life and ensuring no one is denied safe medical care in a crisis. That points toward laws that are clinically clear, allow swift action for threats to life or serious health, and avoid broad criminalization, while also recognizing public concern about elective abortions later in pregnancy. Pairing any legal framework with strong support for parents, adoption, and contraception helps move the focus from blame to fewer unintended pregnancies and healthier families.",
    "Laws on abortion should reflect moral pluralism and medical reality by setting understandable, evidence-based rules that protect health and safety while acknowledging that many see the fetus as worthy of increasing protection over time. A durable approach preserves privacy, ensures meaningful exceptions and timely care in emergencies, and creates predictable guidance for clinicians. Broad investment in prevention\u2014sex education, contraception, prenatal care, and material support for families\u2014offers a shared path to fewer abortions and less suffering.",
    "Laws on abortion should start from two realities many people share: pregnancy can involve urgent, complicated medical circumstances, and potential life carries moral weight for a large part of the public. A workable framework protects timely, evidence-based care and patient privacy, sets clear and medically grounded guardrails with well-defined health exceptions, and avoids criminalizing people in crisis. Alongside any legal line-drawing, governments should invest in prevention and support\u2014contraception, accurate education, prenatal care, paid leave, childcare, and adoption services\u2014so fewer families ever face this decision under duress.",
    "Abortion law should be guided by compassion and medical reality, recognizing that families face time-sensitive decisions that don\u2019t fit politics, while also acknowledging sincere convictions about protecting unborn life. The most stable approach keeps clinicians able to act quickly for health and safety, provides clear standards rather than fear-driven ambiguity, and rejects punishment as a substitute for care. Common ground grows when policy also reduces unwanted pregnancies and financial pressure through contraception access, comprehensive education, prenatal and postpartum care, and concrete help for parents.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to reduce harm and protect dignity by centering patient safety, evidence-based medicine, and informed consent, while making room for the moral seriousness many attach to fetal life. Clear, consistently applied rules with robust exceptions for medical emergencies and severe circumstances can limit chaos without forcing one worldview on everyone. Pairing any legal framework with strong supports for families\u2014health coverage, contraception, prenatal care, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014offers the best chance to lower abortion rates without coercion.",
    "Abortion policy should be written to reflect both personal autonomy and society\u2019s interest in protecting developing life, using medical evidence rather than slogans to define what the law requires. It should guarantee timely care in emergencies, protect privacy, and set straightforward standards that doctors and patients can understand and follow. At the same time, lawmakers should focus on the upstream solutions most people endorse\u2014education, contraception, economic support, and maternal healthcare\u2014so fewer pregnancies become crises.",
    "Laws on abortion should treat it first as a healthcare and family-support issue, not a criminal one, while still recognizing why many citizens want legal respect for unborn life. A practical compromise protects early access and medical decision-making, allows carefully defined limits later with clear health and trauma-related exceptions, and ensures clinicians can act without delay when complications arise. Real common ground comes from investing in prevention and support\u2014contraception, sex education, prenatal care, mental health services, and resources for parenting or adoption\u2014so choices are less driven by fear or poverty.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by a commitment to reduce harm and protect dignity: keep time-sensitive decisions anchored in medical evidence and the patient\u2013clinician relationship, especially in emergencies, while acknowledging that many citizens attach real moral significance to developing life. A workable framework can pair clear, medically grounded guardrails and narrow, explicit exceptions with major investments in prevention\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and economic supports\u2014so fewer people face crisis choices. The goal is fewer tragedies and healthier families through clarity, compassion, and practical help rather than stigma or political gamesmanship.",
    "Abortion law should be guided by both liberty and responsibility: protect privacy and access to safe care, and also recognize society\u2019s interest in potential life by setting transparent, clinically defensible limits that do not block care for rape, incest, severe fetal conditions, or serious threats to health. Whatever the legal line, common ground grows when government focuses on prevention and support\u2014education, contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, paid leave, and childcare\u2014so choosing to continue a pregnancy is genuinely feasible. Policies should aim for consistent rules that doctors can follow and families can live with, not punishment that deepens fear and division.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion for real-life complexity and by medical judgment, while making room for sincere moral disagreement about when legal protection should begin. A durable approach sets clear standards that keep patients safe and allows prompt care in hard cases, alongside strong investments in contraception, sex education, adoption options, and support for parents so fewer pregnancies become emergencies or ultimatums. The measure of good policy is whether it lowers suffering, protects health, and treats everyone involved with dignity.",
    "Abortion laws should be guided by a shared aim: protect life and health without turning private crises into criminal cases. That means rules written with clinicians\u2019 input\u2014clear exceptions for serious medical risk and other grave circumstances\u2014paired with robust supports that prevent unwanted pregnancies and reduce coercion, like contraception access, honest education, prenatal care, and help for families. Even when values differ, policy can focus on practical outcomes: fewer abortions, safer care, and stronger support for women, children, and families.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by evidence-based healthcare and equal dignity, while recognizing that many people view fetal life as morally important and want meaningful limits. Common ground is a system that protects early, timely access and medical privacy, permits carefully defined later restrictions with clear health exceptions, and backs all of it with serious prevention and family support\u2014contraception, sex education, prenatal care, and resources for parenting or adoption. The point is not to force one belief, but to reduce crisis decisions and make outcomes safer and more humane."
