    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for personal autonomy and medical judgment, protecting timely, evidence-based care while allowing narrowly tailored exceptions for serious health risks and tragic circumstances. Policymakers should pair clear, medically grounded limits with robust prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and resources for parents\u2014so fewer people face desperate choices and families can thrive.",
    "Good policy should center the health and dignity of those affected by pregnancy by keeping urgent medical decisions between patients and clinicians, while recognizing a societal interest in protecting developing life through reasonable, transparent limits and compassionate exceptions. That balance is reinforced by investing in prevention and practical supports\u2014access to contraception, healthcare, counseling, and adoption or parenting resources\u2014so choices are safer and rarer without criminalizing people in crisis.",
    "Law should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for differing moral convictions: protect safe, timely access to care and patient privacy, allow narrow exceptions when the mother\u2019s health or severe fetal conditions are at stake, and avoid punitive approaches. At the same time, public policy should reduce demand for abortion through education, contraception, and strong social supports that make parenting or adoption viable options for those who need them.",
    "Reasonable abortion laws can bridge deep disagreements by prioritizing patient safety and clinician judgment, setting clear, medically informed limits with exceptions for life-threatening or traumatic circumstances, and rejecting criminalization of those in need. Coupling those rules with substantial prevention and support measures\u2014affordable healthcare, contraception, sex education, and family assistance\u2014honors both the value many place on unborn life and the real-world needs of families.",
    "Effective policy should respect both the seriousness many attach to unborn life and the autonomy and urgent health needs of pregnant people, by ensuring evidence-based access to care early in pregnancy and narrowly defined exceptions later on. To make such limits humane and workable, laws must be matched with investments in contraception, education, prenatal and postnatal care, and economic supports that reduce coercion and promote healthier outcomes for families.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for personal autonomy and medical judgment, prioritizing the health and safety of pregnant people through clear, evidence\u2011based standards. They should leave time\u2011sensitive decisions primarily between patients and clinicians, provide narrowly defined safeguards for serious medical or traumatic circumstances, and reduce the need for abortion by investing in contraception, comprehensive education, and robust support for parents and families.",
    "Good public policy should protect timely, medically necessary care and personal privacy while honoring widely held moral concerns about unborn life by setting reasonable limits with compassionate exceptions for life\u2011threatening or traumatic situations.

By grounding policy in medical expertise, compassion, and practical help for parents, communities can respect differing moral views while reducing suffering.",
    "Laws should protect the health, dignity, and safety of pregnant people while also honoring the moral concern many hold for developing life; practical policy keeps time-sensitive medical decisions primarily between patients and clinicians and is guided by medical evidence. Reasonable, narrowly defined exceptions should exist for serious health threats, rape, incest, and severe fetal anomalies, and laws should pair any limits with robust prevention and support\u2014affordable contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and postpartum care, and adoption services\u2014so fewer families face desperate choices.",

    "Good law should uphold both the value many place on unborn life and the right of individuals to make time-sensitive medical decisions without political interference; it should set clear, consistent standards informed by medical evidence, allow narrowly tailored exceptions for life\u2011threatening or traumatic circumstances, and avoid criminalizing patients or clinicians, while investing in education, contraception, and practical supports so fewer people must choose under duress.",
    "Policy should prioritize reducing harm by protecting safe, timely access to healthcare and respecting deeply held moral convictions through narrowly defined limits and conscience protections, and by emphasizing prevention\u2014comprehensive sex education, reliable contraception, and meaningful support for parents\u2014to create practical common ground that honors dignity, health, and responsibility.",
    "A durable approach treats abortion as a complex health decision that belongs primarily between patients and qualified clinicians, guided by medical evidence, privacy, and compassion; it recognizes moral concerns by allowing reasoned limits with clear exceptions for rape, incest, fatal fetal conditions, and threats to maternal health, but couples those rules with nonpunitive investments in prevention, prenatal/postpartum care, childcare, and adoption services to reduce the circumstances that lead to abortion and respect differing consciences.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with protection of personal autonomy and the health of pregnant people. They should be guided by medical evidence, allow timely access to care with narrowly defined exceptions for health, rape, incest, and fatal fetal conditions, and keep decisions centered on patients and clinicians rather than politics. Policies should reduce the need for abortion through accessible contraception, comprehensive education, and meaningful supports for parents.",
    "Policy should protect patient privacy and safety while acknowledging the moral concerns many hold about unborn life. Clear, medically grounded limits can coexist with compassionate exceptions and non-punitive safeguards, and must be paired with investments in prevention and social supports\u2014affordable healthcare, childcare, and adoption services\u2014so fewer people face desperate choices. The aim should be fewer abortions, better health outcomes, and mutual respect across differing convictions.",
    "Good law will be evidence-based and centered on minimizing harm: protecting timely medical access, safeguarding clinicians and patients, and allowing narrowly tailored exceptions when needed. At the same time it should promote prevention through contraception, education, and economic and social supports that make parenting viable. By focusing on health, dignity, and practical assistance, policy can bridge moral disagreement without criminalizing people in crisis.",
    "Abortion laws should be practical and humane, balancing the value many place on potential life with compassion for people in complex circumstances and deference to medical judgment. They should emphasize patient-centered care, privacy, and timely access, permit exceptions for serious health risks or traumatic circumstances, and invest in prevention and supports that reduce the need for abortion. Such an approach seeks common ground by prioritizing safety, dignity, and community responsibility.",
    "Laws should respect conscience and differing beliefs while keeping private medical decisions between patients and qualified clinicians, guided by science and clear, consistent standards. Paired with sensible limits where medically warranted, they must also provide robust prevention and family supports\u2014contraception, sex education, prenatal care, and economic assistance\u2014so choices are not driven by lack of resources. The shared goal is healthier families, fewer crises, and policies rooted in compassion rather than punishment."
