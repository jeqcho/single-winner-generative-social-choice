A workable framework can acknowledge the moral seriousness many attach to potential life by focusing policy on prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and resources that make parenting or adoption genuinely viable.

At the same time, any legal framework should take seriously why many people see unborn life as morally significant by focusing on prevention and support that actually reduces crisis pregnancies: affordable contraception, straightforward education, prenatal care, and practical help for parents and adoption.
