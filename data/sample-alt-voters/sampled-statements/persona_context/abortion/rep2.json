    "226": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and the basic idea that time-sensitive healthcare decisions belong with the patient and qualified clinicians, not politicians. A workable middle ground protects privacy and access early in pregnancy, keeps clear exceptions for rape, incest, and threats to life or serious health, and avoids criminalizing people in crisis. At the same time, communities can honor concerns about potential life by putting real resources into prevention and support\u2014sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and help with childcare and adoption\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into the decision.",
    "171": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for privacy, keeping time-sensitive decisions primarily between patients and qualified clinicians rather than politicians. At the same time, a durable framework can acknowledge the moral weight many attach to potential life by pairing clear, workable standards and health exceptions with strong prevention and support\u2014contraception access, honest education, prenatal and mental-health care, and real help for families. Common ground grows when the goal is fewer crises and safer outcomes, not punishment or stigma.",
    "268": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a consistent respect for human life and the dignity of women, using clear, medically grounded standards that protect unborn children while guaranteeing timely care in emergencies and in grave circumstances such as serious threats to the mother\u2019s health. A workable middle ground pairs reasonable limits with compassion\u2014counseling, prenatal care, disability accommodations, adoption support, and real help for families\u2014so fewer people feel trapped by fear, finances, or lack of options. Policy should avoid criminalizing good-faith medical judgment and instead focus on prevention, personal responsibility, and practical support that strengthens families and communities.",
    "88": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for human life and by clear, workable medical standards that protect women from delayed or denied emergency care, including narrowly defined exceptions for threats to life and serious health harm. A stable framework can set reasonable limits as pregnancy progresses while avoiding criminalizing patients and doctors acting in good faith. Common ground is strongest when policy is paired with real support\u2014prenatal and postpartum care, adoption resources, and practical help for families\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into a decision.",
    "393": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion, non-harm, and respect for privacy, keeping time-sensitive decisions anchored in medical evidence and clinician judgment rather than punishment or political fear. A workable path protects safe access\u2014especially early in pregnancy and in emergencies\u2014while allowing carefully defined limits later that include clear exceptions for health risks and severe fetal conditions. Common ground grows when policy also reduces suffering through prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and mental-health care, and practical help for those who choose to carry a pregnancy to term.",
    "289": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by practical compassion: keeping patients safe with clear, medically defined protections for emergencies and serious health risks, while avoiding punishment that pushes families into more danger. A workable approach respects that communities disagree about when life begins by pairing any limits with strong prevention and support\u2014reliable contraception and sex education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real help with childcare and wages\u2014so fewer parents feel trapped by circumstances. When rules are simple enough for doctors to follow and focused on health, dignity, and responsibility, there is more room for shared values like protecting life and strengthening families.",
    "495": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by patient safety, sound medical evidence, and the practical reality that pregnancy can turn into an emergency where timely care saves lives, while still respecting the sincere moral conviction many hold about protecting developing life. Clear, workable standards should keep politicians out of the exam room, guarantee exceptions for life and serious health risks, and avoid criminalizing patients or clinicians acting in good faith. Common ground is strongest when policy also invests in prevention and support\u2014contraception, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, disability accommodations, and family resources\u2014so fewer people are forced into heartbreaking decisions.",
    "417": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a respect for privacy, keeping time-sensitive decisions centered on patients and qualified clinicians rather than political fear or punishment. A durable framework can protect access early in pregnancy, allow reasonable limits later with clear, workable exceptions for health crises, rape, incest, and severe fetal diagnoses, and avoid criminalizing good-faith medical care.

    "797": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by the conviction that human life has value, alongside clear, medically workable protections so patients can receive timely care when a pregnancy threatens life or serious health. A humane framework sets reasonable limits, avoids criminalizing good-faith medical judgment, and pairs any restrictions with real support\u2014affordable prenatal and postpartum care, counseling, disability accommodations, and adoption and parenting resources\u2014so fewer families feel trapped. Common ground comes from focusing on prevention and responsibility, including access to contraception and practical education, while keeping the law consistent, compassionate, and focused on strengthening families rather than scoring political points.",
    "304": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by human dignity, medical reality, and the freedom of families to make time-sensitive healthcare decisions with qualified clinicians, without fear or stigma.

    "717": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for human life and by clear, medically workable rules that protect women from delays in emergencies and other severe circumstances. A durable approach sets reasonable limits as pregnancy progresses, includes narrowly defined exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health risks (and for violence-related cases), and avoids criminalizing doctors acting in good faith. Common ground grows when policy also focuses on prevention and real support\u2014responsible sex education, access to contraception, prenatal care, and practical help for young families\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into that decision.",
    "47": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a consistent respect for human life and human dignity, coupled with clear, medically workable standards that protect women from delayed or denied emergency care and give clinicians confidence to act in good faith. A durable framework can set firm limits as pregnancy progresses while carving out unambiguous exceptions for life-threatening conditions and severe health harms, and it should pair any restrictions with real support for families\u2014prenatal care, adoption pathways, and practical resources that reduce crisis pregnancies. Common ground is best built by prioritizing prevention, responsibility, and family stability, keeping the focus on reducing harm rather than scoring political victories.",
    "653": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by protecting human dignity in two directions at once: taking potential life seriously while keeping medical decisions safe, timely, and grounded in doctors\u2019 judgment rather than fear of punishment. A workable middle path is clear early access, medically defined limits later, and non-negotiable exceptions for threats to health or life, rape, and severe fetal conditions, written so ordinary people and clinics can actually follow them. Common ground grows when the focus shifts from shaming to prevention and support\u2014reliable sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and mental-health care, disability accommodations, and practical help for parenting or adoption\u2014so fewer families feel trapped by circumstances.",

When policy focuses on dignity, equal opportunity, and practical help instead of punishment, it becomes easier for people who disagree to live together and protect health and family stability.",
    "731": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by constitutional privacy and equal protection, deference to evidence-based medical judgment, and compassion for the varied, time-sensitive realities of pregnancy, while acknowledging the sincere moral concern many hold for developing life. A durable framework protects safe, timely access early in pregnancy and guarantees clear exceptions for threats to life or serious health, rape, incest, and catastrophic fetal conditions, with any later limits written so clinicians can act without fear. Common ground is strengthened by reducing unwanted pregnancies and coercion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust prenatal, postpartum, and family supports rather than punishment.",
    "335": "Laws on abortion should be guided by patient safety, medical evidence, and a respect for personal autonomy and privacy, keeping time-sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians rather than politicians. At the same time, policy can acknowledge the moral weight many attach to potential life by allowing reasonable, medically grounded guardrails later in pregnancy with clear, nonnegotiable exceptions for life, serious health risks, rape, incest, and severe fetal conditions. Common ground grows when the focus shifts from punishment to prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families\u2014so fewer people are driven into crisis choices. Clear, consistent rules that protect both conscience and care can lower the temperature and strengthen communities.",
    "572": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by respect for unborn life, a strong commitment to personal responsibility, and mercy for families facing medical emergencies or violence, with clear exceptions that protect a mother\u2019s life and serious health. The rules should be practical and written so doctors can act without fear, while communities and government expand real support\u2014prenatal care, counseling, contraception, and adoption and parenting resources\u2014so fewer women feel cornered by money, timing, or lack of help. A steadier path lowers the heat by focusing less on punishment and politics and more on protecting life, safeguarding health, and strengthening families.",

A workable common ground is protecting access early in pregnancy with clear, nonnegotiable exceptions for serious health threats and pregnancy from violence, while allowing carefully defined later limits tied to viability and medical reality. The surest way to reduce abortions without cruelty is prevention and support\u2014reliable contraception, honest sex education, prenatal and mental-health care, and practical help for families\u2014so fewer people are pushed into desperate choices. Clear rules and strong healthcare protections can lower fear and stigma while honoring the moral seriousness many attach to potential life.",
    "144": "Laws on abortion should be guided by medical evidence, privacy, and compassion\u2014keeping time-sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians, not politicians\u2014while taking seriously the moral weight many attach to potential life. A workable middle ground protects safe access early in pregnancy and guarantees clear exceptions for health emergencies, rape, incest, and severe fetal conditions, with later regulations written tightly enough that care is never delayed. The best way to lower the number of abortions without punishment is to invest in prevention and support\u2014contraception, accurate sex education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real help for students and working families\u2014so choices are shaped by stability, not fear.

    "149": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a steady respect for human life and by clear, safety-first medical standards that let doctors act without hesitation when a pregnancy turns dangerous, while keeping limits practical and consistent rather than political. A workable middle seam is prevention and support\u2014reliable contraception, honest education, prenatal and mental-health care, and real adoption and parenting resources\u2014so fewer families ever reach that breaking point.

    "753": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for moral conscience, keeping time-sensitive decisions centered on the patient and qualified clinicians while ensuring clear protections in emergencies and serious health situations. Any framework that sets limits should be written plainly enough that doctors aren\u2019t left guessing and should avoid turning personal crises into criminal cases. Common ground is easiest to hold onto when communities put real muscle behind prevention and support\u2014sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, disability supports, adoption resources, and help for people living on tight budgets\u2014so fewer are pushed toward desperate choices. The goal should be less suffering, more dignity, and steadier lives for children, parents, and neighbors.",
