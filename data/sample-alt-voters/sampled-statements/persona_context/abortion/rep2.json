    "151": "I believe laws on abortion should begin with a real respect for unborn life and the seriousness of the decision, while also being written with enough humility and medical clarity to protect a mother\u2019s life and handle truly tragic situations without delay or fear. Whatever limits are set, they should be paired with strong, practical support\u2014prenatal care, counseling, adoption services, and real help for parents\u2014so fewer families ever feel cornered into a desperate choice. If we focus less on punishment and more on responsibility, compassion, and prevention, we can protect the vulnerable and keep communities from tearing each other apart.",
    "369": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal conscience, keeping decisions as much as possible between a patient and a qualified doctor\u2014especially when health, rape, or severe complications are involved. At the same time, I hear the concern for protecting potential life, so I can support clear, medically grounded guardrails later in pregnancy as long as they don\u2019t turn emergencies into courtroom delays. The best common ground is putting real effort into prevention and support\u2014honest sex education, affordable contraception, and practical help for parents\u2014so fewer people ever feel trapped in a crisis.",
    "441": "I\u2019ve come to believe laws on abortion should treat unborn life with real respect, but also be written with compassion and clear medical exceptions so doctors can protect a woman\u2019s life and health without fear or delay. The best way to lower abortions isn\u2019t only through bans, but by preventing crisis pregnancies and making it easier to choose life\u2014through honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and strong adoption and community support. If we can agree on dignity, safety, and fewer desperate situations, we can argue less and protect more.",
    "138": "I see abortion as a serious moral decision, and I want laws that show real respect for unborn life without ignoring the messy medical realities families can face. That means clear, consistent limits with well-defined exceptions for rape, incest, and when a mother\u2019s life or health is at risk, written so doctors can act quickly in emergencies. If we\u2019re serious about fewer abortions, we should put just as much effort into prevention and support\u2014responsible sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, adoption options, and real help for parents\u2014so people aren\u2019t backed into a corner.",
    "565": "I see abortion as a serious moral issue, but I also don\u2019t want laws written so rigidly that they put women in danger or leave doctors afraid to act in an emergency. A fair approach is clear limits that protect unborn life, paired with straightforward exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and severe medical situations, and real support so carrying a pregnancy to term is actually doable\u2014prenatal care, adoption help, and accountability for fathers. If we keep the focus on compassion, prevention, and practical help instead of punishment and politics, we can lower the number of abortions and treat people with dignity even when we disagree.",
    "339": "Laws on abortion should be guided by the rule of law, equal protection, and medically grounded standards that keep time-sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and licensed clinicians, not political actors. I can respect the moral seriousness many attach to developing life while still insisting on clear, workable protections for early access and unambiguous exceptions for life and serious health risks, rape, and incest so no one is forced into preventable tragedy. The most durable common ground is pairing any legal guardrails with real prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and practical help for parents\u2014so fewer people ever face this decision in crisis.",
    "458": "I see abortion as a serious moral issue, and I want laws that value unborn life while also being honest about messy realities like medical emergencies, rape, and situations where delay can put a woman at real risk. The most workable approach to me is clear, medically grounded limits with straightforward exceptions, written so doctors can act without fear and families aren\u2019t turned into criminals in a crisis. If we\u2019re serious about reducing abortions, we should put just as much effort into prevention and support\u2014reliable contraception, accurate education, prenatal care, adoption that works, and real help for parents\u2014so fewer people ever feel trapped in the first place.",
    "499": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a clear respect for personal autonomy, while acknowledging that many people experience this as a profound moral question about developing life. I favor protecting safe, timely access early in pregnancy and writing unambiguous exceptions for health emergencies, rape, incest, and severe fetal conditions so doctors can act without fear and families aren\u2019t forced into dangerous delays. If we want fewer abortions and less suffering, the practical path is prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real help with childcare and paid leave so carrying a pregnancy is a genuine option, not a financial cliff.",
    "66": "I believe abortion laws should start with real respect for human life, but they also have to be clear, medically grounded, and compassionate enough that doctors can act quickly when a mother\u2019s life or health is on the line and when pregnancies result from violence. What I keep coming back to is that we\u2019ll argue less and protect more if we pair reasonable limits with strong, practical support\u2014prenatal care, adoption that actually works, counseling, and real accountability for fathers\u2014so fewer families feel cornered into a crisis. The goal shouldn\u2019t be punishment or politics; it should be fewer abortions, safer mothers, and stronger families and communities.",
    "267": "I\u2019ve come to believe abortion laws should start with respect for unborn life, but they also have to face medical reality and be written with compassion so families and doctors aren\u2019t trapped when danger or tragedy hits. Clear limits with plain, well-defined exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats\u2014and for the hardest cases like rape or incest\u2014feel more honest than shouting past each other. If we really want fewer abortions, we ought to put more effort into prevention and support: responsible relationships, access to contraception, strong prenatal care, and real help for parents and adoption.",
    "720": "I believe laws on abortion should be guided first by respect for human life, but also by mercy and medical reality when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at stake or when a pregnancy comes from violence. What I can agree on with many viewpoints is that we\u2019ll prevent more heartbreak by putting real support around women and families\u2014prenatal care, adoption help, counseling, and making fathers accountable\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into a decision they never wanted. Clear, workable rules and a calmer tone would help us protect the vulnerable without treating anyone in crisis like a political punching bag.",
    "17": "I don\u2019t want politicians substituting for patients and doctors in a time-sensitive medical decision, and I think the law should keep abortion safe and legal early in pregnancy with clear, medically grounded exceptions when someone\u2019s health or life is at risk. At the same time, I can respect that many people see this as morally serious, which is why I support reasonable, science-based guardrails later in pregnancy and a bigger push on prevention\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and real support for prenatal care, childcare, and adoption. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing unintended pregnancies and making it easier to raise healthy kids, we can protect dignity while lowering the number of crises that lead to abortion.",
    "581": "I believe abortion laws should start with a serious respect for unborn life while being honest that pregnancies can involve medical emergencies and heartbreaking circumstances, so exceptions for a mother\u2019s life and clear, workable medical judgment have to be written in plain language. At the same time, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll reduce abortions by punishment alone; the durable path is prevention and support\u2014responsible education, access to contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and adoption and childcare resources that make choosing to carry a pregnancy realistic. If we keep the focus on compassion, clarity, and fewer crisis pregnancies, people with very different moral convictions can still agree on rules that protect health and dignity.",
    "324": "I\u2019m torn between the belief that potential life deserves real moral seriousness and the reality that pregnancy can turn into a medical and family crisis fast, so laws should keep early abortion legal and safe and guarantee clear, workable exceptions for rape, incest, and threats to health or life without trapping doctors and families in fear. The best common ground I see is putting more energy into prevention and support\u2014straightforward sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for parents\u2014so fewer people ever reach that cliff-edge decision. If we write policy with compassion, medical clarity, and a focus on reducing harm, we can protect dignity on both sides and lower the temperature without pretending the issue is simple.",
    "510": "I want abortion laws guided by real-world compassion and medical evidence: keep early care safe and legal, and make sure clear exceptions protect health and life without forcing doctors to hesitate in an emergency. I also don\u2019t think we should pretend the moral weight is trivial, so any limits later in pregnancy should be workable, consistent, and rooted in medicine\u2014not politics. The strongest common ground is prevention and support: honest sex education, affordable contraception, and a safety net that makes it easier to carry a pregnancy and raise a child, because fewer crises is a goal nearly everyone can share.",
    "64": "I\u2019m uneasy with laws that turn a complicated medical and moral decision into a blunt criminal matter, so I favor keeping abortion safe and legal early in pregnancy and ensuring clear, workable exceptions whenever a patient\u2019s life or health is at risk, or when pregnancy follows rape or incest. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the sincere conviction many hold about protecting developing life, which is why any policy should be medically grounded, stable, and paired with serious investments that prevent crisis pregnancies\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical support for parents and adoption. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing harm and strengthening families, we can argue less and protect more.",
    "212": "I\u2019m guided first by the value of human life, but also by a conviction that laws should be clear, workable, and compassionate in the hardest circumstances, especially when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at stake. I can support reasonable limits that reflect the moral weight of abortion, paired with well-defined exceptions and the kind of practical help\u2014prenatal care, adoption support, and steady community resources\u2014that makes choosing life more possible. If we put less energy into shaming and more into prevention, responsibility, and real support for families, we can lower the number of abortions while treating people in crisis with dignity.",
    "56": "I\u2019ve seen up close how quickly pregnancies can turn medically complicated, so laws should keep care safe and timely and leave room for patients and clinicians to act without fear in emergencies, while still treating the decision with the seriousness many people feel about developing life. A workable middle path is protecting early access, setting clear, medically grounded limits later on with straightforward exceptions for life and health threats and for pregnancies from violence. If we truly want fewer abortions, we should put as much effort into prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and real help for parents and adoption\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered.",
    "90": "I want abortion laws that keep people safe and let urgent, deeply personal medical decisions stay with patients and their doctors, while still treating the choice with moral seriousness and making room for conscience. To me, the most workable balance is protecting access early in pregnancy and guaranteeing clear exceptions for health emergencies, rape, and severe fetal complications, so no family is forced into danger by rigid rules. At the same time, we should put real muscle behind prevention and support\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, paid leave, and childcare\u2014because fewer unintended pregnancies and stronger families is a goal people across the spectrum can share.",
    "181": "I see abortion as a serious, often heartbreaking decision, so laws should respect unborn life while also leaving room for clear, medically grounded exceptions when a woman\u2019s life or health is at risk and in cases like rape or incest. What makes the biggest difference is keeping rules workable for doctors and families and backing them up with real support\u2014prenatal care, adoption services, and help with the costs of raising a child\u2014so fewer people feel trapped. If we focus on prevention through responsible education and access to contraception, and on compassion instead of punishment, we can lower abortions and lower the temperature at the same time.",
    "388": "Abortion laws should keep patients safe and decisions grounded in medical reality, because pregnancy can turn complicated fast and families deserve clear, timely care\u2014not red tape or fear. I also don\u2019t brush off the moral weight many attach to developing life, so I\u2019m open to early access with reasonable, medically grounded limits later on, with firm exceptions for health, rape, incest, and severe fetal conditions. If we\u2019re serious about reducing abortions, we\u2019ve got to put our money where our mouth is: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and real support for parents\u2014childcare, paid leave, and healthcare\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered.",
    "272": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a commitment to protect life and health in the real world, with humility about how complicated pregnancy can get and with medical decisions kept as close as possible to the patient and clinician. I can respect the moral weight many place on unborn life while still rejecting blanket bans that ignore rape, incest, or emergencies and put families and doctors in impossible situations. The strongest common ground I see is prevention and support: honest education, affordable contraception, and real help for parents and kids so fewer people ever reach a crisis point. Like good land stewardship, the goal should be less harm and more responsibility\u2014clear rules, clear exceptions, and a community that shows up before and after a child is born.",
    "220": "I\u2019ve learned that the best laws are the ones that keep people safe in real life and treat hard moments with compassion, not politics or punishment, so I want abortion care to stay legal and medically guided\u2014especially early on and always when someone\u2019s health or life is at risk. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many feel about unborn life, and I think we can lower the number of abortions by doing the practical things most families agree on: honest education, affordable contraception, and real support for pregnancy, childcare, and adoption. If we put dignity, clear medical rules, and stronger help for parents at the center, we can protect freedom and respect life without turning neighbors into enemies.",
    "377": "I believe abortion laws should start with a real respect for unborn life and the seriousness of the decision, while also being honest that families sometimes face medical emergencies or traumatic circumstances where rigid rules can do real harm. The most workable approach is clear limits with well-defined exceptions to protect a woman\u2019s life and health (and for the hardest cases), paired with practical support that actually reduces abortions\u2014reliable contraception, responsible education, adoption options, and help for parents so no one feels trapped. If we keep politics out of the exam room as much as possible and put our energy into prevention and compassion, we can protect both dignity and life without treating people in crisis like criminals.",
    "123": "I think abortion laws should treat unborn life with real seriousness while also being honest that pregnancies can turn into medical emergencies or involve trauma, so any limits need clear, workable exceptions that let doctors act quickly to protect a woman\u2019s life and health. At the same time, if we want fewer abortions and fewer families feeling trapped, the focus can\u2019t just be on bans\u2014it has to include prevention and support like responsible sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and adoption and parenting resources. I\u2019m looking for rules that are consistent and humane, keep politics out of the exam room in crisis situations, and encourage communities to show up with help instead of judgment.",
    "298": "Laws on abortion should be guided by individual liberty and medical reality, with decisions kept as close as possible to the person and their doctor, not politicians writing one-size-fits-all rules. I also think we should be honest that ending a pregnancy can carry real moral weight, so any limits need to be clear, workable, and include solid exceptions for life-threatening complications, rape, and severe fetal conditions. If we want fewer abortions and less suffering, the most practical path is prevention and support\u2014straight talk education, easy access to contraception, and real help for parents\u2014so fewer families feel cornered into a choice they never wanted to face.",
    "639": "Abortion laws should treat unborn life with seriousness while also staying grounded in medical reality, with clear, workable exceptions when a mother\u2019s life or health is at risk and in the most tragic circumstances. I\u2019m wary of one-size-fits-all rules that leave doctors guessing or families stranded, so the lines we draw should be consistent, evidence-based, and focused on reducing harm rather than scoring points. The best common ground is pairing reasonable limits with real prevention and support\u2014contraception and honest education, along with prenatal care, adoption pathways, and practical help\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into a choice they\u2019ll carry for a lifetime.",
    "400": "I see abortion as a morally serious decision where the law should respect developing life, but it also has to be written in a way that keeps women safe and lets doctors act quickly in medical emergencies and other truly tragic cases. Like setting the rules of the road, we need clear, consistent limits and exceptions that people can actually follow, instead of political whiplash that leaves families and clinicians guessing. The best common ground I can find is pairing whatever legal lines we draw with real prevention and support\u2014education that\u2019s honest, contraception that\u2019s accessible, adoption that\u2019s workable, and practical help for parents\u2014so fewer people ever feel backed into that choice.",
    "186": "Abortion is a serious moral matter, and I lean toward laws that protect unborn life with clear, workable limits, while also making sure there are straightforward exceptions when a mother\u2019s life or health is truly at risk and in the hardest cases like rape or incest. I don\u2019t trust politicians to micromanage medicine, so the rules should be plain enough that doctors can act fast without fear, and women in crisis aren\u2019t treated like criminals. The best way to lower abortion rates, and cool the anger around it, is to pair any limits with real prevention and support\u2014responsible sex education, affordable contraception, adoption options that work, and practical help for parents who choose to carry to term.",
    "223": "Laws on abortion should reflect both the seriousness of ending a developing life and the reality that some pregnancies involve violence, medical danger, or heartbreaking complications that can\u2019t be handled well by rigid, one-size-fits-all rules. I want clear limits that most people can understand, paired with plain, workable exceptions that let doctors act quickly to protect a woman\u2019s life and health without fear of prosecution. If we\u2019re serious about reducing abortions, we should put at least as much effort into prevention and support\u2014education that\u2019s honest, contraception people can afford, adoption that\u2019s realistic, and real help for parents\u2014so fewer families ever reach a crisis point.",
    "507": "Abortion laws ought to be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a sober respect for both a person\u2019s autonomy and the moral weight many attach to developing life, with clear, workable protections for emergencies and serious health risks so doctors aren\u2019t second-guessing care in a crisis. I\u2019m wary of one-size-fits-all bans or anything that turns the exam room into a courtroom, but I also think we\u2019d lower the temperature if we paired reasonable guardrails with real commitments to reduce unintended pregnancies\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, and strong support for parents and adoption. If we focus less on punishment and more on prevention and care, we can protect dignity while making fewer families ever face this crossroads in the first place.",
    "294": "I believe abortion law should start with a serious respect for unborn life while being honest about medical realities and the heartbreaking situations families can face, so rules need clear, workable exceptions to protect a mother\u2019s life and health and to address cases like rape or incest. Real progress also means preventing crisis pregnancies through responsible education, affordable contraception, and strong support for prenatal care, adoption, and parents, so fewer people feel cornered into a decision. If we keep the tone humane and the policy practical\u2014clear standards for doctors, help for families, and less politics in the exam room\u2014we can protect dignity and reduce suffering even when we don\u2019t agree on every line.",
    "545": "I want abortion laws to be rooted in compassion and real medical reality: decisions should stay primarily between a patient and their doctor, with clear protections for health and safety and access early in pregnancy so no one is pushed into dangerous delays. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many people feel about developing life, which is why I can support reasonable, medically grounded guardrails later on as long as they include straightforward exceptions for life, health, rape, incest, and catastrophic fetal diagnoses. The most durable common ground, to me, is putting serious effort into prevention and support\u2014accurate sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, childcare, and paid leave\u2014so fewer people ever face this crisis and more families can choose parenthood without being crushed by cost or circumstance.",
    "730": "I don\u2019t think politicians should be making time-sensitive medical decisions that belong in the exam room, so the law should protect safe, legal access early in pregnancy and guarantee clear, workable exceptions when someone\u2019s life or health is at risk or when pregnancies result from violence. At the same time, I take seriously that many people see potential life as morally meaningful, which is why I can support medically grounded limits later in pregnancy that don\u2019t criminalize patients or doctors. The best common ground is investing hard in what prevents crisis decisions in the first place\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal and mental health care, and real support for parents\u2014so fewer families ever have to face this choice.",
    "231": "Abortion laws should respect that ending a pregnancy is a serious moral matter for many people, while also recognizing that real-life medical emergencies and traumatic circumstances don\u2019t fit neat rules written in a capitol. I can support clear, workable limits with straightforward exceptions to protect a woman\u2019s life and health and for cases like rape or incest, written so doctors aren\u2019t guessing in a crisis. If we\u2019re serious about fewer abortions, we ought to put as much effort into prevention and support\u2014responsible education, affordable contraception, and practical help for pregnancy, adoption, and raising a child\u2014as we do into arguing about punishments.",
    "654": "I want abortion laws that keep patients safe and respect the reality that these decisions are personal, time-sensitive, and often medically complex, while still acknowledging the moral weight many people attach to developing life. The most durable approach, to me, protects access early in pregnancy, guarantees clear exceptions for life and health, rape, and severe fetal conditions, and relies on medical standards instead of political guesswork. If we\u2019re serious about reducing abortions and heartbreak, we should invest at least as much in prevention and support\u2014accurate sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, childcare, and paid leave\u2014so fewer families ever feel trapped in the first place.",
    "22": "Abortion laws should start with respect for human life and the seriousness of ending a pregnancy, but they also have to be written clearly enough that doctors can act fast in real emergencies without fear, and families aren\u2019t left navigating gray areas. I can support reasonable limits with well-defined exceptions for threats to the mother\u2019s life and severe medical situations, alongside practical steps that actually prevent crisis pregnancies\u2014reliable education, access to contraception, and real support for prenatal care, adoption, and new parents. If the goal is fewer abortions and less suffering, we\u2019ll get farther by pairing guardrails with resources and compassion instead of shame or political point-scoring.",
    "120": "I believe abortion law should be grounded in compassion, medical evidence, and the practical reality that these decisions are time-sensitive and deeply personal, so patients and clinicians\u2014not politicians\u2014can act quickly to protect health and dignity. At the same time, I take seriously that many people view developing life as morally significant, which is why I can support clear, medically grounded guardrails later in pregnancy alongside firm exceptions for life, health, rape, incest, and severe fetal complications. The surest common ground is reducing crisis pregnancies in the first place with accurate education, affordable contraception, and real support for parents\u2014healthcare, paid leave, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014so fewer families ever feel cornered.",
    "631": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and the dignity of families making time-sensitive decisions, keeping politicians out of the exam room while still treating potential life with seriousness. I can\u2019t support rigid bans that ignore emergencies, violence, or devastating diagnoses, but I do think clear, workable standards and protections for health matter so no one is left in danger or fear. To me, the real common ground is prevention and support: honest education, affordable contraception, and a stronger safety net\u2014health care, childcare, and leave\u2014so fewer people feel forced into an impossible choice, because \u201c\u89e3\u94c3\u8fd8\u987b\u7cfb\u94c3\u4eba\u201d (the one who tied the knot must untie it).",
    "240": "Abortion law should start from a serious respect for developing human life while also facing the medical and moral complexity families encounter when pregnancies go wrong, so clear standards and real-world exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and severe health threats are essential. I\u2019m wary of rules so rigid they punish doctors for acting in emergencies, but I\u2019m also not comfortable treating abortion as just another procedure with no limits. The most durable path pairs reasonable, medically grounded guardrails with practical commitments that actually reduce abortions\u2014prevention, responsible fatherhood, adoption pathways that work, and tangible support for parents and children. If we keep the focus on dignity, safety, and fewer crises rather than political victory, there\u2019s room for people of good faith to live together under the same law.",
    "423": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal conscience, keeping time\u2011sensitive decisions as close as possible to a patient and their clinician while recognizing the moral weight many attach to developing life. I can\u2019t support rigid bans that endanger health or turn emergencies into paperwork, but I can support clear, workable guardrails later in pregnancy with straightforward exceptions for life and serious health threats, rape, and severe fetal conditions. The surest common ground is prevention and support\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for parents\u2014so fewer people ever face a crisis with no real options.",
    "41": "I\u2019ve learned that pregnancy decisions can be medically urgent, morally serious, and deeply personal, so laws should protect safe, timely care and keep clinicians free to act when health or life is at risk. At the same time, I hear the shared desire to value developing life by preventing crisis pregnancies through accurate education, affordable contraception, and real support for people who carry to term\u2014prenatal care, paid leave, childcare, and adoption resources that work. A workable approach is early legal access with clear, medically grounded limits later in pregnancy, written plainly with humane exceptions, so the law reduces harm instead of adding fear and confusion. If we focus less on punishment and more on prevention, safety, and dignity, there\u2019s room for people of good faith to meet in the middle.",
    "393": "I\u2019ve come to see abortion as a morally serious and often painful decision that should be handled with humility, compassion, and clear medical judgment\u2014not fear, shame, or politics. The law should protect safe, timely care and privacy, especially in emergencies, while also recognizing the sincere desire many feel to honor developing life by encouraging early decision-making and medically grounded guardrails later in pregnancy. Where I think we can meet is in doing far more to prevent crisis pregnancies and reduce abortions in the first place: honest education, affordable contraception, and real support for pregnancy, parenting, adoption, and mental health so no one feels cornered or alone.",
    "602": "I want abortion laws that are boringly predictable and medically grounded: protect privacy and early access, draw any later limits around clear viability and safety standards, and hard-code unambiguous exceptions for life, serious health threats, rape, incest, and catastrophic fetal conditions so doctors aren\u2019t forced to \u201ctroubleshoot\u201d in court. I can respect that many people see unborn life as morally significant, but I don\u2019t trust the state to write one-size-fits-all rules for edge cases, so the goal should be minimizing harm while keeping decisions close to patients and clinicians. The most durable common ground is prevention and support\u2014straightforward sex education, affordable contraception, and real help for parents and adoption\u2014so fewer families ever hit a crisis point in the first place.",
    "406": "Abortion is morally serious to me because it involves developing life, but I also don\u2019t want laws written so rigidly that they endanger women in medical emergencies or turn doctors into criminals for acting in good faith. The most durable approach pairs clear, medically workable limits and well-defined exceptions (for life-threatening complications and other truly tragic circumstances) with a serious commitment to prevention and support\u2014contraception, honest education, prenatal care, adoption options, and concrete help for families. If we focus less on punishment and more on responsibility, compassion, and fewer crises, we can protect dignity on both sides and lower the temperature around an issue that has wounded communities for too long.",
    "136": "I don\u2019t trust politicians to micromanage a decision this personal, especially when medical situations can turn fast, so the law should protect privacy and timely care early in pregnancy and guarantee clear, workable exceptions when health or life is on the line. At the same time, I can\u2019t pretend there\u2019s no moral weight here, so I\u2019m open to reasonable, medically grounded limits later on if they\u2019re paired with real ways to prevent crisis pregnancies\u2014affordable contraception, straight talk education, and support that makes choosing to carry to term or place for adoption a practical option. If we focus less on punishment and more on clear rules, safety, and fewer people getting cornered, it\u2019s possible to respect both liberty and the value people place on developing life.",
    "183": "I want laws on abortion to keep patients safe and decisions anchored in medical reality, with early access protected and clear, workable exceptions when health is at risk or circumstances are traumatic\u2014because rigid rules tend to land hardest on families already under strain. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many attach to developing life, so I can support reasonable, medically grounded guardrails later in pregnancy if they\u2019re paired with real prevention and support: accurate sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and childcare that make choosing parenthood genuinely feasible. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing harm and unwanted pregnancies, we can protect dignity while lowering the number of people who ever face this decision.",
    "492": "I want abortion laws that keep time-sensitive medical decisions primarily between a patient and a qualified clinician, with clear, workable protections for health and emergencies and a stable framework that isn\u2019t rewritten every election cycle.

I can\u2019t support policies that turn crisis care into a legal minefield, but I do think we can reduce the number of abortions by doing the unglamorous work most families recognize\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and mental health care, and real support like childcare and paid leave. The common thread I keep coming back to is harm reduction with dignity: keep people safe and informed, protect clear health exceptions, and build a society where choosing to parent is genuinely feasible.",
    "121": "I believe abortion law should start with a serious respect for unborn life, but it also has to be clear, workable, and compassionate enough that doctors can act quickly in true emergencies and families aren\u2019t driven into fear or secrecy. A reasonable framework would set firm limits as pregnancy progresses, include narrowly defined exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and severe medical realities (and for pregnancies from violence), and avoid treating women in crisis like criminals. If we\u2019re serious about reducing abortions, we should put as much effort into prevention and support\u2014responsible relationships, access to contraception, strong prenatal care, and adoption and parenting resources\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into this decision.",
    "270": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and the principle that time-sensitive healthcare decisions belong with the patient and their clinician, not politics\u2014especially when someone\u2019s health or safety is on the line. At the same time, I take seriously that many people view pregnancy and potential life as morally weighty, which is why I can support clear, evidence-based guardrails later in pregnancy alongside robust, unambiguous exceptions for life, health, and severe fetal complications. The surest common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place with comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and a stronger safety net\u2014prenatal and mental healthcare, paid leave, and childcare\u2014so fewer families feel cornered into any choice."
