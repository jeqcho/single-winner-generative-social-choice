    "310": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by limited government, clear medical reality, and respect for individual liberty, while acknowledging that developing life has moral weight for many people. A workable middle ground protects early access and privacy, sets evidence-based limits later tied to viability, and guarantees straightforward exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to life or health so doctors can act without fear. Common ground grows when policy focuses less on punishment and more on prevention and support\u2014reliable contraception, honest education, prenatal care, and practical help for families\u2014so fewer people reach a crisis point.",
    "126": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion and dignity, taking both the moral weight many place on unborn life and the real medical and family crises that can surround a pregnancy seriously. Clear, workable rules should protect timely care and privacy, include well-defined exceptions for rape, incest, and threats to a woman\u2019s life or serious health, and avoid treating patients or clinicians like criminals in moments of fear. Common ground is strongest when communities also invest in prevention and support\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, adoption services, and practical help for parents\u2014so fewer families ever face this decision under desperation.",
    "635": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a steady respect for unborn life, a clear duty to protect a woman\u2019s life and serious health, and the humility to recognize that some pregnancies involve tragedy and medical complexity. Reasonable limits with plainly written exceptions for rape, incest, and life-threatening situations should be paired with strong support for prenatal care, adoption, and practical help after birth so fewer families feel cornered by fear or finances. The public interest is best served when decisions remain grounded in sound medicine, informed consent, and compassion\u2014without treating women or clinicians as criminals or political symbols.",
    "185": "Laws on abortion should be guided by medical evidence, privacy, and basic fairness, keeping time\u2011sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians while ensuring clear protections when health, rape, or incest are involved. Because many pregnancies are shaped by money, childcare, and access to care, the law should pair any limits with real support\u2014contraception, accurate sex education, prenatal and postpartum healthcare, and affordable childcare\u2014so fewer families are pushed into crisis. Common ground starts by rejecting punishment and stigma, and focusing instead on reducing harm, preventing coercion, and helping children be born into circumstances where they can thrive.",
    "294": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by respect for human life and the practical need to keep women safe, with clear, workable standards shaped by medical expertise rather than political theater. Reasonable limits that reflect fetal development can be paired with explicit exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to a mother\u2019s life or health, while avoiding criminalizing patients and doctors acting in good faith. Common ground is strongest when policy also invests in prevention and stability\u2014education, contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, adoption support, and workplace and community resources\u2014so fewer families ever face the decision in crisis.",
    "330": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by respeto por la vida and compassion for women facing painful, complicated situations, with clear protections for medical emergencies and well-defined exceptions for rape or incest. Rules work best when they are medically grounded, consistent, and avoid turning families or doctors into criminals, while still setting reasonable limits that reflect the seriousness of ending a pregnancy. Common ground also means investing in what prevents crisis choices\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and real support for parenting or adoption\u2014so fewer people feel trapped.",
    "528": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by evidence-based medicine, privacy, and the need for timely, clinician-led care, while acknowledging that many people attach real moral weight to developing life. A durable framework protects access early in pregnancy and guarantees clear exceptions for rape, incest, and threats to life or serious health, with later regulations tied to viability and medical judgment rather than punishment. Common ground grows when policy also reduces crisis pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong supports for parents\u2014healthcare, paid leave, and childcare\u2014so fewer families are forced into impossible decisions.",
    "44": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by clear, medically grounded standards that protect privacy, timely care, and patient safety, while acknowledging that many people attach real moral weight to developing life. A durable compromise keeps early access legal, avoids criminalizing patients or clinicians, and sets narrowly tailored later-pregnancy limits with explicit exceptions for rape, incest, fetal nonviability, and serious threats to life or health, written so they can be followed and enforced predictably. Common ground grows when policy also invests in what measurably reduces crisis pregnancies\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and practical supports for parents\u2014so fewer families reach this decision under pressure.",
    "465": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a consistent respect for human dignity\u2014taking unborn life seriously while ensuring timely, medically sound care when pregnancy involves rape, incest, life-threatening danger, or serious health harm. Clear, workable standards written with clinician input should avoid criminalizing patients or good-faith medical practice, and should keep decisions grounded in informed consent and the doctor\u2013patient relationship rather than political brinkmanship. Common ground is strongest when any limits are paired with real support that makes choosing life more feasible\u2014prenatal and postpartum care, adoption resources, and practical help for families\u2014so fewer pregnancies become crises in the first place.",
    "566": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by evidence-based medicine, privacy, and respect for bodily autonomy, with clear protections for timely care when health, rape, or incest are involved and without criminalizing patients or clinicians. Durable policy can also acknowledge the moral seriousness many attach to potential life by setting carefully defined, medically workable limits later in pregnancy and by building strong guardrails against coercion. Common ground is most likely when lawmakers pair any legal framework with real prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and the practical resources that make parenting or adoption a viable choice.",
    "758": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by protecting health and dignity, keeping urgent medical decisions in the hands of patients and qualified doctors, and avoiding punishment that pushes families into fear or unsafe options. A workable middle ground is to guarantee timely care early in pregnancy and clear exceptions for rape, incest, and threats to life or serious health, while setting later limits that follow medical evidence, not politics. Real common ground also means investing in what prevents crisis pregnancies and supports children\u2014affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and strong workplace and family supports\u2014so fewer families are forced into impossible choices.",
    "158": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a strong respect for privacy, keeping time-sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians rather than politicians.

A humane framework can acknowledge the moral seriousness many attach to potential life without criminalizing people in vulnerable moments, focusing on reducing harm and strengthening community stability.",
    "335": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by medically grounded standards that protect privacy and timely care, with clear exceptions for rape, incest, and threats to a patient\u2019s life or serious health, while avoiding criminalizing patients or clinicians. Because this decision often reflects real pressures on families, policy should pair any gestational guardrails with practical support\u2014reliable contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and maternal care, and family resources like childcare and paid leave\u2014so fewer people face crisis pregnancies. In a pluralistic community, the most durable approach acknowledges the moral seriousness many attach to potential life while keeping government out of the exam room and focusing on reducing harm and strengthening families.",
    "260": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion and practical realism: protecting patient health and privacy, keeping urgent decisions in the hands of qualified clinicians, and avoiding criminal penalties that push care into unsafe corners. At the same time, they can acknowledge the moral weight many attach to developing life by allowing broader access early in pregnancy, clearer medical standards later on, and firm, explicit exceptions for rape, incest, and threats to life or serious health. Common ground is strongest when policy also reduces the need for abortion through reliable contraception, honest education, prenatal care, and real support for families who choose to carry to term.",
    "243": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by evidence-based medicine, bodily autonomy, and a commitment to public peace, keeping time-sensitive decisions primarily in the patient\u2013clinician relationship and never criminalizing people in crisis. A durable framework can pair early access and strong privacy protections with clear, medically defined safeguards later in pregnancy, including unambiguous exceptions for rape, incest, and threats to life or serious health. Common ground is strengthened when law is matched with social responsibility\u2014affordable contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and postpartum care, childcare support, and adoption resources\u2014so fewer families are pushed toward desperate choices.",
    "558": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by medically grounded, clearly written standards that protect patient safety and privacy, keep time-sensitive decisions in the clinician\u2013patient relationship, and avoid criminalizing people in crisis. A durable framework can recognize the moral weight many attach to developing life by allowing broad access early in pregnancy, pairing later limits with well-defined exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to life or health. Common ground is strengthened by investing in what measurably reduces unwanted pregnancies and hardship\u2014reliable contraception, honest education, prenatal and maternal care, and practical support for families and adoption.",
    "726": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a limited, clearly written role for government that respects the moral weight many place on unborn life while keeping urgent medical decisions grounded in clinician judgment and patient safety. Reasonable gestational limits with explicit, workable exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to a woman\u2019s life or health can protect both human dignity and due process without turning families or doctors into criminals.

    "617": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a sober respect for human life and by clear, medically grounded rules that protect women in emergencies, including well-defined exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to life or health. Durable policy avoids turning doctors and families into criminals, sets reasonable limits as pregnancy progresses, and keeps standards precise enough to be enforceable and humane.

The focus should stay on measurable harm reduction\u2014safe care, clear due process, and avoiding criminalization\u2014while investing in what reliably lowers unwanted pregnancies and crisis decisions (contraception access, accurate education, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and real support for parents and adoption). Durable policy requires clean definitions and enforceable rules that keep politics out of the exam room while leaving room for sincere moral and religious disagreement.",

    "222": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by constitutional privacy, equal protection, and evidence-based medical standards, so time-sensitive decisions remain centered on the patient\u2013clinician relationship rather than political guesswork. A durable framework can protect broad access early in pregnancy, draw clearer limits later that track viability and safety, and require explicit exceptions for rape, incest, severe fetal conditions, and serious threats to life or health\u2014while avoiding criminalization of patients or doctors. Common ground is strengthened when the law also invests in what measurably reduces unintended pregnancies and hardship: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, paid leave, and childcare.
