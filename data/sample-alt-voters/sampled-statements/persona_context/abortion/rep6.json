    "575": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by medical evidence, patient safety, and privacy, keeping urgent decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians rather than politics. A durable compromise recognizes the moral weight many attach to potential life by pairing early, accessible care and clear health-based exceptions with reasonable, clinically grounded limits later in pregnancy. Common ground grows when policy focuses on prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and real help for parents\u2014so fewer people reach a crisis point in the first place.",
    "185": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and the reality that pregnancy decisions are time-sensitive and deeply tied to a family\u2019s health and ability to care for the children they already have. The most workable approach keeps politicians out of the exam room, protects safe access and clear emergency exceptions, and pairs any limits with real prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, paid leave, and childcare. That kind of policy respects moral disagreement while focusing on what most people share: fewer crises, healthier families, and dignity instead of punishment.",
    "335": "Laws on abortion should be guided by medically grounded, workable standards that protect patient safety, privacy, and timely decision-making with qualified clinicians, while acknowledging the genuine moral weight many place on developing life. A durable framework protects early access and clearly defined exceptions for rape, incest, severe fetal anomalies, and threats to life or serious health, and avoids turning families or doctors into criminals for acting in good faith. Common ground is strengthened by pairing any legal rules with prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for parents\u2014so fewer people ever face a crisis choice.",
    "206": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a practical duty to protect life where possible and to protect women\u2019s health and safety in real emergencies, with clear, workable standards written alongside medical expertise rather than political slogans. Reasonable limits can coexist with well-defined exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to life or major health, while avoiding criminalizing patients and clinicians acting in good faith.

Common ground grows when policy also invests in prevention and real family support\u2014reliable sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, childcare, and paid leave\u2014so fewer families ever reach a crisis point.",
    "664": "Laws on abortion should be guided by evidence-based medicine, privacy, and a limited role for government, keeping urgent decisions with patients and qualified clinicians\u2014especially when health or viability is at stake. Durable policy can also respect the moral gravity many attach to developing life by using clear, medically grounded standards and by prioritizing prevention through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal and family supports. The aim should be fewer crises and less harm, achieved through compassion and practical help rather than punishment or political posturing.",
    "124": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a clear respect for unborn life and by the practical reality that pregnancy can turn into a fast-moving medical crisis, so rules must be written with clinicians to protect a mother\u2019s life and serious health without hesitation or fear. A workable middle ground sets defined limits on elective abortion, includes narrowly tailored exceptions for rape, incest, severe fetal conditions, and medical emergencies, and avoids criminalizing patients while holding providers to consistent safety and informed-consent standards. Common ground grows when policy also reduces the demand for abortion through accessible contraception, responsible education, adoption support, and concrete help for families raising children.",

A fair approach sets reasonable limits on elective abortion\u2014especially later in pregnancy\u2014while investing hard in prevention and support: affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal care, adoption services, and practical help so choosing to carry a pregnancy isn\u2019t driven by financial desperation. The goal should be fewer abortions and less suffering, reached through responsibility and compassion rather than punishment or political point-scoring.",
    "682": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a steady respect for human life, clear medical reality, and compassion for people facing crisis situations, with rules written tightly enough that doctors can act quickly in emergencies without fear. A workable middle ground protects unborn life through reasonable limits and firm exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to the mother\u2019s life or health, while keeping decisions as close as possible to the patient\u2013clinician relationship. Real common ground also means investing in prevention and support\u2014contraception access, accurate education, prenatal care, adoption services, and practical help for families\u2014so fewer pregnancies become desperate, time-pressured choices.",

A workable middle ground protects safe access early and guarantees clear, non-negotiable exceptions for threats to life or serious health, rape or incest, and severe fetal conditions, with medically grounded standards that let doctors act without fear. Lasting progress also means reducing the number of crisis pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and real support for families so choices are shaped by opportunity rather than desperation.",
    "451": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by evidence-based medicine, patient privacy, and the practical reality that pregnancy decisions can become urgent and medically complex, so clinicians must be able to act without fear of criminalization. At the same time, policy can acknowledge the moral weight many attach to potential life by emphasizing early, safe access paired with reasonable, clearly defined later-pregnancy standards and exceptions for health, rape, incest, and severe fetal conditions.

    "522": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by evidence-based medicine, patient safety, and privacy, keeping time-sensitive decisions anchored in the clinician\u2013patient relationship rather than political punishment. A durable middle ground protects early access and clear, workable exceptions for threats to life or serious health, rape or incest, and nonviable or catastrophic fetal conditions, while allowing carefully defined limits later that reflect widespread moral concern for potential life.
