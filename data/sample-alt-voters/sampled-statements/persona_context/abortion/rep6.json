    "485": "Abortion law should be guided by medical reality, privacy, and compassion, keeping urgent decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians rather than politicians. I can respect the moral seriousness many people attach to potential life while still believing that blanket bans and criminal penalties create more harm, especially in emergencies and devastating circumstances. The most durable common ground is pairing protected access\u2014especially early and when health is at stake\u2014with serious investment in prevention and support: accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families who choose to carry a pregnancy.",
    "673": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for personal conscience, keeping urgent decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians instead of politicians. I also believe the best way to lower abortion rates is upstream: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real economic support so choosing to carry a pregnancy is truly possible. We can honor the moral seriousness many people feel about potential life while still protecting privacy, safety, and clear health exceptions, because punishing people in crisis doesn\u2019t build healthier families or communities.",
    "380": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for personal conscience, keeping decisions as close as possible to the patient and trusted clinicians rather than politicians. I can hold the moral seriousness many people feel about potential life while also recognizing that real pregnancies can involve trauma, poverty, and medical complexity that no one-size-fits-all rule can handle safely. The most durable common ground is to protect timely care with clear health exceptions and pair it with prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal and postpartum resources\u2014so fewer people ever face this decision in crisis.",
    "125": "I think abortion laws should be guided by compassion, privacy, and solid medical evidence, so people can make time-sensitive decisions with their doctor without fear of punishment or political interference. I can respect that many see real moral weight in protecting potential life, which is why I favor clear health-and-safety standards, real exceptions for medical emergencies and trauma, and fewer late-pregnancy abortions through prevention rather than coercion. The best common ground is investing in what actually reduces crisis pregnancies\u2014affordable contraception, honest sex education, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical support for families\u2014so more pregnancies are wanted and more parents feel they can say yes.",
    "451": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, privacy, and medical evidence, keeping time-sensitive decisions as close as possible to the patient and their clinicians rather than politics. I can respect the moral seriousness many people feel about potential life, which is why I favor clear, workable guardrails that protect health, allow medical exceptions without hesitation, and avoid criminalizing people in crisis. The most durable common ground is prevention and support: honest education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families so fewer pregnancies are unwanted and fewer choices feel forced.",
    "70": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a deep respect for human life, clear medical realities, and compassion for families facing situations that can be frightening and heartbreaking. I can support firm, understandable limits that protect the unborn, as long as they include real, workable exceptions for threats to a mother\u2019s life and serious medical crises, and don\u2019t turn doctors and patients into criminals in an emergency. If we want fewer abortions and healthier families, we should put just as much effort into prevention and support\u2014responsible education, access to contraception, prenatal care, and practical help for mothers and adoption\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into this decision.",
    "597": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, privacy, and medical reality\u2014keeping time\u2011sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians, not politicians\u2014while acknowledging the sincere moral weight many people place on potential life. I can support reasonable, clearly written guardrails that protect health and allow doctors to act quickly in emergencies, alongside real investments that prevent crisis pregnancies in the first place: accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal and mental-health care, and practical help for parents. If we focus less on punishment and more on safety, prevention, and support, we can lower the temperature and protect dignity for everyone involved.",
    "291": "Abortion laws should be guided by medical evidence, compassion, and the reality that pregnancy can turn into a time-sensitive health crisis, so decisions stay centered on the patient and clinician\u2014not politics. I can respect the moral seriousness many people attach to potential life, but I don\u2019t think punishment or vague bans that delay care create healthier families or safer outcomes. The most workable common ground is protecting timely, safe access early on with clear health exceptions, while investing hard in prevention and support\u2014affordable contraception, honest education, and stronger prenatal and postpartum care\u2014so fewer people are ever forced into this choice.",
    "763": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a serious respect for moral conscience\u2014keeping time\u2011sensitive decisions as close as possible to the patient and the clinician, not the courtroom. I can hold the weight many people place on potential life while still insisting that bans without workable health exceptions and clear clinical standards predictably cause suffering and unsafe delays. The most durable common ground is reducing crisis pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal/postpartum and parenting support, so more pregnancies are wanted and more families feel they truly have choices.",
    "799": "I believe abortion laws should start with a real respect for human life, but they also have to be grounded in medical reality so doctors can act quickly in emergencies and women aren\u2019t turned into criminals in the middle of a crisis. If we want fewer abortions, the most practical path is prevention and support: clear information, reliable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and real help for anyone choosing to carry a pregnancy to term. We won\u2019t all draw the line in the same place, but we can agree that any limits should be clear, humane, and paired with resources that make responsibility and family stability possible.",
    "414": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion and medical reality, keeping urgent decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians instead of politicians, with clear protections when someone\u2019s health or safety is on the line. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many people feel about potential life, which is why I support reasonable, evidence-based guardrails later in pregnancy and a serious push on prevention\u2014access to contraception, honest education, and strong prenatal and postpartum care. If we put real resources behind parents and kids so fewer pregnancies are unwanted or unsupported, we can lower the temperature and reduce harm without turning personal crisis into a courtroom fight.",
    "614": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for private decision-making\u2014keeping politicians out of the exam room and trusting patients and doctors, especially when time is critical. I also hear the sincere moral concern many people feel about potential life, which is why I support reasonable, medically grounded guardrails alongside clear protections for a pregnant person\u2019s health and safety. The best common ground is investing hard in what prevents crisis pregnancies and supports families\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and childcare\u2014so more pregnancies are wanted and fewer people ever feel cornered.",
    "657": "I want abortion laws to be guided by compassion, privacy, and solid medical evidence, so that time-sensitive decisions stay with the person who\u2019s pregnant and their doctor rather than turning into politics or punishment. I also respect that many people feel a real moral obligation to protect potential life, which is why I can support clear, workable guardrails tied to viability and strong, explicit exceptions for health emergencies, rape, incest, and nonviable pregnancies. The truest common ground, to me, is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place through affordable contraception and honest education, and backing families up with prenatal care, postpartum care, and practical support so fewer people feel trapped.",
    "608": "Abortion is a morally serious issue, and laws should start with respect for unborn life while still being honest about medical reality and making sure doctors can act quickly in emergencies to protect a mother\u2019s life and health. I can support clear limits with carefully defined exceptions, paired with practical steps that actually reduce abortions\u2014better contraception access, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real support for parents and adoption. If we focus less on punishment and slogans and more on responsibility, compassion, and workable rules, we can protect more lives and keep families from being crushed in a crisis.",
    "492": "Abortion law should be grounded in medical evidence, privacy, and compassion, keeping urgent decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians rather than politicians, while acknowledging the genuine moral seriousness many people attach to potential life. I can support clear, workable guardrails that track viability and protect health, with unambiguous exceptions for life and serious health risks, rape or incest, and severe fetal conditions so care isn\u2019t delayed by fear of prosecution. If we want fewer abortions and less bitterness, the practical path is prevention and support\u2014reliable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and economic stability\u2014so more pregnancies are wanted and more families can thrive.",
    "719": "Laws on abortion should be guided by medical reality, privacy, and compassion, because these decisions are time\u2011sensitive and often wrapped up in circumstances that don\u2019t fit a simple rulebook. I can respect the moral weight many people place on potential life while still believing the government shouldn\u2019t force one outcome in every case\u2014especially when health, violence, or nonviable pregnancies are involved. The most durable common ground is reducing crisis pregnancies in the first place through accurate education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, postpartum, and family supports, so fewer people feel trapped between bad options.",
    "567": "Abortion law should be guided by medical evidence, privacy, and compassion, because real cases are often messy, time-sensitive, and impossible to fit into rigid categories. I can respect the moral seriousness many attach to potential life while still believing the safest, fairest approach is to protect early access, guarantee clear exceptions for health emergencies and trauma, and keep decisions centered on patients and clinicians\u2014not prosecutors. If the shared goal is fewer crises, then prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families\u2014should be treated as core policy, not an afterthought.",
    "758": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and the idea that tough, time\u2011sensitive decisions belong with the pregnant person and their doctor, not politicians\u2014especially when health, violence, or a nonviable pregnancy is involved. At the same time, if we truly want fewer abortions, we should put real resources into prevention and support: affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and help that makes raising a child possible. I can respect that people feel strongly about protecting life, but the law should reduce harm and keep families from being punished when they\u2019re already in crisis.",
    "21": "I don\u2019t think politicians can write one rule that fits every pregnancy, so laws should protect safe, timely abortion care and keep the toughest decisions between a patient and their doctor, especially when health, rape, or severe fetal issues are involved. At the same time, I hear the moral weight many people feel about potential life, and I think we can lower abortions in a real way by investing in what prevents crisis\u2014honest sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and mental health care, and support that makes parenting or adoption actually doable. If we lead with compassion and medical facts instead of punishment and shame, we can protect dignity while giving families more stable options.",
    "489": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by a serious respect for human life, tempered by compassion and clear medical reality, so that truly urgent situations are handled quickly and without fear. The law should set understandable limits with well-defined exceptions for threats to a mother\u2019s life and other grave circumstances, while keeping routine medical judgment out of political point-scoring. If we\u2019re sincere about reducing abortions, we should put more effort into prevention and support\u2014responsible education, access to contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real help for families and adoption\u2014so fewer people feel cornered in the first place.",
    "392": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, clear medical evidence, and respect for conscience, so families and doctors can make time-sensitive decisions without politicians turning a crisis into a courtroom. At the same time, I don\u2019t want abortion treated casually, which is why I support reasonable, medically grounded guardrails and clear exceptions for threats to health, rape or incest, and nonviable pregnancies. The strongest common ground is prevention and support: affordable contraception, honest education, good prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help so carrying a pregnancy to term is truly possible. If we keep the focus on dignity, safety, and stable families, we can lower the temperature and reduce harm even when we disagree about where every line belongs.",
    "279": "Abortion law should be guided by medical evidence, privacy, and compassion, keeping urgent decisions as close as possible to the patient and clinician rather than turning crisis care into a legal battle. I can respect the moral weight people attach to potential life while still believing rigid bans create real harm, so a workable framework protects early access and guarantees clear, fast exceptions when health, assault, or nonviable pregnancies are involved. If we\u2019re serious about reducing abortions and strengthening families, we should put more effort into prevention and support\u2014comprehensive education, affordable contraception, prenatal and mental-health care, childcare, and paid leave\u2014so more pregnancies are healthy, wanted, and sustainably supported.",
    "661": "I\u2019m guided by a respect for unborn life, but I also can\u2019t ignore that pregnancies can turn into medical emergencies or traumatic situations where families need fast, compassionate care rather than fear of prosecution. The law should draw clear, workable limits while spelling out real, medically grounded exceptions to protect a mother\u2019s life and serious health, and it should be paired with practical support\u2014prenatal and postpartum care, adoption services, and help with childcare\u2014so choosing to carry a pregnancy isn\u2019t made impossible by money or lack of support. If we focus on prevention, honest information, and strengthening families, we can lower the number of abortions and treat people with dignity even when we disagree about where every line should be.",
    "589": "I take the value of human life seriously, but I also think laws have to deal honestly with messy realities, especially medical emergencies, assault, and situations where doctors need to act fast without fearing prosecutors. The most workable approach is clear, humane limits with well-defined exceptions, paired with real prevention and support\u2014contraception, straightforward adoption paths, solid prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help that makes choosing to carry a pregnancy possible. If we focus less on punishing people in crisis and more on responsibility, safety, and fewer unwanted pregnancies, we can protect more lives and lower the temperature on all sides.",
    "655": "I want abortion laws grounded in medical evidence, privacy, and compassion, because rigid rules don\u2019t match the real-life situations families face and they can create dangerous delays when time matters. At the same time, I take seriously that many people see potential life as morally significant, so I can support clear, workable guardrails later in pregnancy that include strong health exceptions and leave doctors room to act. The most practical common ground is prevention and support: honest education, affordable contraception, and real prenatal, postpartum, childcare, and mental-health resources so fewer pregnancies are in crisis and more children are welcomed into stable homes.",
    "60": "Laws on abortion should be guided by medical reality, privacy, and compassion, because in the moments when a pregnancy turns complicated, decisions need to happen quickly between a patient and a doctor\u2014not after politicians or courts get involved. I can respect that many people see real moral weight in potential life, which is why I\u2019m open to clear, workable guardrails later in pregnancy that still include strong, unambiguous exceptions for health, rape, and incest. The best common ground is preventing crises in the first place with affordable contraception, honest education, and real support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption so fewer people feel trapped into any choice.",
    "254": "I come at abortion laws wanting less suffering and more honesty\u2014trusting medical judgment and personal conscience in time\u2011sensitive situations, while keeping politics from turning a private crisis into punishment. At the same time, I can\u2019t ignore the moral weight many people feel about protecting life, so I\u2019d rather put our energy into prevention and real support: affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and the kind of housing, childcare, and stability that makes welcoming a child truly possible. If we focus on safety, dignity, and fewer crisis pregnancies, we can argue less about labels and more about helping people make the most responsible choice they can.",
    "274": "I want abortion laws guided by medical reality, privacy, and compassion, because these decisions are often time-sensitive and deeply personal and shouldn\u2019t be turned into political punishments. I also respect that many people feel a real moral duty to protect potential life, so I\u2019m open to clear, workable guardrails that don\u2019t block emergency care or force dangerous delays. The most common ground, to me, is prevention and support: affordable contraception, honest education, and real help for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption so fewer people ever feel cornered into an impossible choice.",
    "776": "I\u2019m persuaded that abortion law should be grounded in medical reality and harm reduction: keep time\u2011sensitive decisions primarily between a patient and qualified clinicians, with clear, workable guardrails that protect health and address rare but devastating circumstances. At the same time, it\u2019s reasonable to treat potential life with moral seriousness, which is why I support pairing any legal framework with practical measures that actually reduce unwanted pregnancies\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and real support for parents and adoption. If policy stays evidence-based, consistent, and compassionate, we can protect dignity and safety without turning private crises into political or legal battles.",
    "801": "I believe abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and privacy, keeping urgent decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians rather than politicians, while still treating the moral weight of potential life with seriousness. The most durable common ground is protecting safe, timely care\u2014especially for health emergencies, rape or incest, and nonviable pregnancies\u2014paired with practical steps that prevent crises in the first place: accurate education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, postpartum, and family supports. If we focus less on punishment and more on prevention and stability for families, we can reduce suffering and lower the temperature without pretending this issue has a one-size-fits-all answer.",
    "69": "I\u2019m guided by a respect for human life and a belief that responsibility matters, but I also know real life gets messy and the law has to handle the hard cases without turning a medical crisis into a courtroom fight. To me, the best approach sets clear, workable limits with well-defined exceptions for threats to a mother\u2019s life and serious health emergencies, and treats people with compassion instead of shame. If we want fewer abortions, we\u2019ll get further by putting real muscle behind prevention and support\u2014contraception, honest education, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families and adoption\u2014so fewer people feel cornered in the first place.",
    "473": "I hold the moral weight of pregnancy with real reverence, but I don\u2019t believe politicians should replace patients, families, and doctors in moments that are private, time-sensitive, and sometimes heartbreaking. The law should protect safe, timely care\u2014especially when health is at risk, a pregnancy is nonviable, or there is trauma\u2014while keeping room for conscience and refusing to turn people in crisis into criminals. If we want fewer abortions, the most honest common ground is prevention and support: accurate education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help so choosing to carry a pregnancy is a real option, not a slogan.",
    "87": "I believe abortion laws should be guided first by compassion, privacy, and medical reality, so families and doctors can make time\u2011sensitive decisions without political interference\u2014especially when health, violence, or nonviable pregnancies are involved. At the same time, I take seriously that many people see moral value in potential life, which is why I support clear, medically grounded guardrails later in pregnancy and a strong focus on preventing unwanted pregnancies through contraception and honest education. If we want fewer abortions and healthier families, we should put more energy into prenatal and postpartum care, childcare, and practical support so carrying a pregnancy to term is truly a viable option rather than a slogan.",
    "273": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for private decision-making, because pregnancy can involve time-sensitive realities that don\u2019t fit clean political rules and are best handled with a patient and clinician at the center. I also hear the sincere moral concern for potential life, which is why I support clear, workable guardrails that protect health and allow for hard cases, alongside serious investment in what reduces crisis pregnancies in the first place\u2014honest education, accessible contraception, and real support for parents and children. If we focus less on punishment and more on prevention, safety, and stability for families, we can lower the temperature and write policy that protects dignity even amid disagreement.",
    "194": "I believe abortion laws should start from a serious respect for human life while also being honest about medical reality and the fact that some pregnancies involve urgent, heartbreaking complications. A workable approach sets clear, carefully defined limits with explicit exceptions so doctors can act quickly to protect a woman\u2019s life and serious health, while keeping enforcement focused on providers and standards of care rather than punishing people in crisis. If we\u2019re sincere about reducing abortions, we should put equal energy into prevention and support\u2014better prenatal care, straightforward adoption options, and practical help that makes carrying a pregnancy to term more realistic.",
    "606": "I want abortion laws guided by medical evidence, privacy, and compassion, because rigid rules don\u2019t match the messy reality of pregnancy and can turn urgent healthcare into a legal gamble. At the same time, I take seriously that many people feel a moral responsibility to protect potential life, which is why I\u2019m open to clear, workable guardrails later in pregnancy that preserve clinician judgment and include strong health and safety exceptions. The most durable common ground is investing hard in prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and real economic help for parents\u2014so fewer people face this decision in crisis and more children are welcomed into stable circumstances.",
    "86": "I believe abortion laws should start with respect for human life and also enough humility to recognize that real pregnancies can bring medical emergencies, violence, and heartbreaking complications that no family should have to navigate through fear of prosecution. The law should set clear, workable limits with firm exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and it should keep room for doctors to act quickly and responsibly. If we want fewer abortions, we\u2019ll do more good by putting real support on the front end\u2014affordable prenatal care, counseling, adoption help, and practical resources\u2014so people aren\u2019t pushed into a crisis by loneliness, money, or lack of options.",
    "11": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, clear medical evidence, and respect for personal conscience, because real pregnancies can turn complicated fast and the worst moment to add fear is when someone needs timely care. To me, common ground looks like protecting safe access early on with well-defined health exceptions later, while putting serious energy into prevention and support\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered. If we can keep politicians out of the exam room and keep responsibility and real resources in the community, we can lower abortion rates without treating anyone in crisis like a criminal.",
    "12": "I want laws on abortion to reflect a serious respect for human life while also being clear, medically grounded, and compassionate enough to handle the hard cases without turning a medical crisis into a legal one. A workable approach sets reasonable limits with well-defined exceptions for threats to a mother\u2019s life and serious health risks, and avoids vague rules that scare doctors from acting. At the same time, if we\u2019re honest about wanting fewer abortions, we should put real effort into prevention and support\u2014education that\u2019s responsible and truthful, access to contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help and adoption options so choosing to carry a pregnancy is truly possible.",
    "4": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and the reality that families sometimes face painful, time-sensitive situations where politicians can\u2019t see the full picture. I can respect the sincere desire to protect potential life while still believing the safest, most humane approach keeps decisions primarily between a patient and their doctor, with clear protections for health and for pregnancies involving violence or nonviable outcomes. If we really want fewer abortions and stronger families, we should invest in what prevents crisis in the first place\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical support so welcoming a child is truly possible.",
    "124": "Laws on abortion should take the value of unborn life seriously while also being honest about medical reality and the messy, time-sensitive situations families can face, so clear limits must come with well-defined exceptions that let doctors act quickly to protect a mother\u2019s life and health. I\u2019m persuaded that the most durable approach is pairing any legal guardrails with practical prevention and support\u2014accurate education, access to contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and adoption and family resources\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into this decision. If we keep the focus on responsibility, compassion, and workable rules instead of punishment or politics, we can protect more life and lower the temperature in a debate that\u2019s tearing communities apart.",
    "718": "Laws on abortion should be guided by evidence-based medicine, patient safety, and informed consent, with enough clinical discretion that time-sensitive complications can be managed in the exam room instead of the courtroom. I can respect the moral seriousness many people attach to potential life, but I don\u2019t support one-size-fits-all bans that delay care or punish people in crisis. The most durable common ground is prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal and postpartum resources so more pregnancies are healthy and truly wanted.",
    "326": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and humility about how messy real life can be, keeping time\u2011sensitive decisions mainly between a patient and their doctor rather than politicians. At the same time, I can\u2019t ignore the moral gravity many people feel about potential life, so I\u2019m open to reasonable, medically grounded guardrails later in pregnancy as long as there are clear protections for health, rape or incest, and severe fetal conditions. The most practical common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies and making real choices possible\u2014affordable contraception, honest education, strong prenatal and mental-health care, and support for parents\u2014kore ga daiji. If we center dignity and safety instead of punishment and slogans, we can lower the temperature and reduce harm for everyone.",
    "91": "I\u2019m guided by a respect for human life and a belief that laws should be clear, enforceable, and anchored in real medical facts\u2014not slogans\u2014so doctors can act quickly in true emergencies and people aren\u2019t left guessing. I can support reasonable limits that reflect the seriousness of ending a pregnancy, paired with explicit exceptions for threats to the mother\u2019s life and other extreme circumstances, and a strong commitment to prevention through contraception access, accurate education, and practical help for women who want to carry to term. If we focus on fewer unintended pregnancies, fewer late-term crises, and more support for mothers, babies, and adoption, we can lower the temperature and write policy that\u2019s firm but humane.",

I can take seriously the moral weight many people feel about potential life while still believing no one in a crisis should be pushed into unsafe delays or treated like a criminal. The clearest common ground is preventing unwanted pregnancies and supporting families with real help\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, childcare, and paid leave\u2014so more pregnancies are healthy, wanted, and supported.",
    "470": "I\u2019m wary of politicians turning a deeply personal, time\u2011sensitive medical decision into a one-size-fits-all rule, so laws should prioritize privacy, clear medical standards, and real room for doctors to act quickly to protect a patient\u2019s life and health. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many attach to unborn life, which is why I can support reasonable, clearly written guardrails alongside strong, practical steps that prevent crisis pregnancies\u2014straightforward access to contraception, honest education, and real support for prenatal care, adoption, and parents who choose to carry to term. If we focus less on punishment and more on responsibility, safety, and fewer unwanted pregnancies, we can lower the temperature and protect dignity on all sides.",

I can hold my convictions and still say we shouldn\u2019t shame people in crisis; we should respond with compassion and accountability, \u00bfme entiendes?

I can respect that people attach deep moral weight to potential life, which is why I\u2019m open to clear, workable guardrails later in pregnancy as long as there are strong health exceptions and no one is criminalized for being in a crisis. If we actually want fewer abortions, the move is prevention and support: affordable contraception, honest sex ed, and real prenatal/postpartum and childcare resources so people aren\u2019t forced into impossible choices. Let\u2019s keep it safe, factual, and humane\u2014because shouting doesn\u2019t help anyone.",

The most honest common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies with affordable contraception, respectful education, and real support for families before and after birth, including prenatal care and childcare. Any legal framework should be clear about health protections and emergencies, and it should focus on reducing harm and helping communities stay strong instead of punishing people in the hardest moments.",
    "666": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, privacy, and medical evidence, trusting patients and clinicians to navigate circumstances that are often complex, time-sensitive, and morally weighty. I can respect the sincere desire to protect potential life while still believing the state should not force one set of beliefs into the exam room, especially when health, viability, or trauma are involved.
