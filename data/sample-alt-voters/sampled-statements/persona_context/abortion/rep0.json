    "707": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by medical evidence, patient privacy, and compassion for families facing time-sensitive, complicated realities, keeping decisions anchored in the patient\u2013clinician relationship rather than political punishment. Because many people hold sincere moral convictions about potential life, policy should pair clear protections for emergencies and health with practical supports that make parenting possible\u2014prenatal care, childcare, disability services, paid leave, and adoption resources. Common ground is strongest when the goal becomes fewer crises through comprehensive sex education and affordable contraception, while preserving dignity and freedom of conscience for everyone involved.",
    "210": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion, clear medical standards, and a focus on keeping families safe and stable, especially when a pregnancy involves serious health risks or crisis situations. A workable approach protects privacy and lets doctors act without fear in emergencies, while allowing communities to express moral concern through practical help instead of punishment. Common ground grows when policy also prevents unintended pregnancies with honest education and affordable contraception, and backs up family values with real support like prenatal care, childcare, and adoption resources.",
    "26": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by medical evidence, patient privacy, and compassion, keeping time-sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and licensed clinicians rather than politicians. Clear, workable rules should protect emergency care and health exceptions, avoid criminalizing patients or doctors, and be written plainly enough that no one hesitates in a crisis. Common ground is strengthened by pairing any legal framework with prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and real help for parents and adoption\u2014so fewer people face the decision under desperation.",
    "624": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a strong respect for unborn life, while never delaying urgent medical care when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at stake. Clear limits with plainly written exceptions for rape, incest, and medical emergencies can reflect moral concerns without turning families and doctors into criminals in a crisis. Common ground is best built by pairing any legal line with real help\u2014prenatal care, disability supports, adoption options, and practical assistance\u2014so fewer pregnancies become desperate situations in the first place.",
    "575": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion and medical reality, keeping urgent, time-sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and licensed clinicians instead of politicians, with clear protections for health and emergency care. A durable approach can also respect the moral weight many attach to potential life by focusing on prevention\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, and real support for parents and adoption\u2014so fewer people are pushed into crisis choices. Policy should avoid criminalizing patients or providers and aim for practical outcomes that protect dignity, safety, and long-term community well-being.",
    "18": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by medical evidence, patient safety, and privacy, keeping time-sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians rather than politicians. Because pregnancy can involve trauma, severe fetal diagnoses, or life-threatening complications, any framework must include clear, workable exceptions for health and emergencies and avoid criminalizing care. Common ground is most realistic when policy also prevents crisis pregnancies and supports families after birth through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and accessible healthcare and social services, so fewer people are forced into desperate choices.",
    "742": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by medical evidence, patient privacy, and compassion for the complex realities families face, keeping time-sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians rather than politics.

Common ground is strongest when policy aims to reduce harm and unintended pregnancies without criminalizing people in crisis or substituting ideology for clinical judgment.",
    "644": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion, privacy, and sound medical judgment, keeping time-sensitive decisions primarily between patients and licensed clinicians rather than politicians. A durable framework can acknowledge the moral seriousness many attach to potential life by pairing early, safe access and clear emergency and health exceptions with practical measures that prevent unintended pregnancy\u2014honest education, affordable contraception\u2014and real support for families, adoption, and children after birth. Common ground is best built by reducing harm and stigma, refusing to criminalize people in crisis, and focusing public policy on healthier outcomes for women, families, and communities.",
    "391": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by respect for human life, clear medical reality, and a limited, workable role for government that doesn\u2019t leave doctors and families guessing in an emergency. A durable approach sets plainly written gestational limits with firm exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to the mother\u2019s life or long-term health, while avoiding criminalizing women in crisis. Common ground grows when policy also focuses on fewer unwanted pregnancies through responsible education and access to contraception, and backs it up with real support for prenatal care, adoption, and parents who choose to carry to term.",
    "303": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by medical evidence, patient safety, and privacy, keeping time-sensitive decisions anchored in the patient\u2013clinician relationship rather than political punishment. They should also reflect the moral seriousness many communities feel by focusing on prevention\u2014honest education and affordable contraception\u2014and by strengthening real supports for families, from prenatal care and counseling to childcare and paid leave. Clear, workable rules with unambiguous exceptions for life, health, rape, incest, and severe fetal conditions can reduce harm and help people live together with dignity even when beliefs differ.",

    "470": "Laws on abortion should be guided by individual liberty and personal responsibility, keeping government out of private medical decisions as much as possible while setting clear, medically grounded protections so doctors can act quickly in emergencies without fear. A workable framework respects the moral seriousness many attach to developing life by favoring prevention\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, and real support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption\u2014over punishment. The focus should be fewer crisis pregnancies, safer care when needed, and rules written plainly enough to be applied consistently and humanely.",
    "235": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a respect for privacy, keeping time-sensitive decisions centered on patients and qualified clinicians rather than politicians. A workable approach can acknowledge the moral seriousness many attach to potential life by pairing early, safe access and clear health-and-emergency exceptions with reasonable, evidence-based guardrails as pregnancies progress.

    "540": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by medical evidence, patient privacy, and the practical reality that pregnancy complications and family circumstances can turn urgent fast, so clinicians must be able to act without fear or delay. A workable framework can protect access to safe care\u2014especially early in pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, or severe fetal diagnosis\u2014while allowing carefully defined guardrails later that are written clearly enough to keep patients and providers out of legal traps. Common ground is strongest when policy also invests in what reduces crisis pregnancies and supports families afterward: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, childcare, and paid leave.",
    "121": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a sober respect for human life and the practical reality that pregnancy can turn into a medical emergency, so rules must be clear, workable for clinicians, and include firm exceptions to protect a woman\u2019s life and serious health. A durable framework can set reasonable limits that reflect community moral concerns while refusing to criminalize families or doctors in crisis, and should be paired with strong prevention and support\u2014access to contraception and accurate education, plus real help for prenatal care, adoption, and parenting. Policy that prioritizes accountability, compassion, and measurable outcomes can reduce both abortions and needless harm while lowering the temperature of a debate that too often turns neighbors into enemies.",
    "490": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a sober respect for human life and personal responsibility, while staying grounded in medical reality so doctors can act quickly in emergencies and patients aren\u2019t pushed into dangerous delays. Clear, workable limits can reflect community values, but they must include well-defined exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to a woman\u2019s life or long-term health, and avoid criminalizing people in crisis.

Because people of good faith disagree about potential life, durable policy should avoid criminalization and instead pair any legal framework with practical prevention and support\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and resources for parenting and adoption\u2014so fewer families face crisis choices and more children and parents can thrive.",
    "322": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by evidence-based medicine, personal liberty, and a clear commitment to reducing preventable harm, keeping time-sensitive decisions primarily within the patient\u2013clinician relationship rather than the criminal code.
