    "788": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a steady respect for human life and by compassion for women and families facing frightening, complicated situations, with decisions grounded in medical judgment rather than politics. A workable path sets clear, enforceable limits while making explicit room for exceptions in cases like rape, incest, and serious threats to the mother\u2019s life or health, so doctors can act without fear and families aren\u2019t pushed into danger. Common ground grows when any legal standard is paired with practical support\u2014prenatal care, adoption resources, and real help for parents\u2014so fewer pregnancies end in crisis and fewer people feel cornered into this choice.",
    "571": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion, evidence-based medicine, and the principle that time-sensitive healthcare decisions belong primarily in the patient\u2013clinician relationship, not in criminal court. A durable framework can protect early access and privacy while allowing carefully defined, medically workable limits later in pregnancy with clear exceptions for threats to health, rape, incest, and severe fetal conditions. Common ground grows when policy also reduces unintended pregnancies and hardship through honest education, affordable contraception, and strong supports for prenatal care, parenting, and adoption, so fewer families ever reach a crisis point.",

Clear protections for early access and for emergencies\u2014including threats to health, rape, and incest\u2014can coexist with narrowly tailored, medically workable guardrails later in pregnancy without criminalizing care. Common ground grows when policy also tackles the root causes through honest education, affordable contraception, and real support for families raising children, so fewer people are pushed into crisis.",
    "134": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion and evidence-based medicine, keeping time-sensitive decisions anchored in the patient\u2013clinician relationship rather than criminal statutes that delay care. A workable middle ground protects early access and medical privacy, while setting clear, doctor-written exceptions for emergencies, rape, incest, and severe fetal complications so no one is forced into preventable suffering. Common ground grows when policy also reduces unwanted pregnancies through honest sex education, affordable contraception, and real material support for parents, so choosing to continue a pregnancy is truly possible.",
    "314": "Laws on abortion should be guided by evidence-based healthcare, compassion, and respect for bodily autonomy, keeping politicians out of the exam room while ensuring timely, safe care and clear protections for medical emergencies and serious health risks. A workable compromise can protect early access and rely on clinician judgment later in pregnancy, paired with serious investments that people across the spectrum tend to support\u2014affordable contraception, accurate sex education, prenatal care, and real help for families raising kids. The goal should be fewer crisis pregnancies and less harm, without criminalizing patients or doctors acting in good faith.",

    "734": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a steady respect for unborn life and a clear-eyed concern for a woman\u2019s health, with rules written plainly enough that doctors can act quickly in emergencies without fear. Like tending a crop, policy ought to protect what\u2019s growing while recognizing that storms come\u2014allowing narrow, well-defined exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to the mother\u2019s life or long-term health. Common ground is strongest when limits are paired with practical support that makes choosing life more possible: prenatal care, adoption resources, and real help for families so fewer people feel cornered into the decision.",
    "237": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for unborn life and by the reality that pregnancy can present urgent, complex medical situations that require timely decisions led by clinicians, not political improvisation. A workable compromise protects the mother\u2019s life and health with clear, medically defined exceptions (including rape and incest), sets reasonable limits as pregnancy progresses, and avoids criminalizing patients or doctors acting in good faith.

    "482": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a clear respect for privacy, keeping time-sensitive decisions primarily between a patient and qualified clinicians rather than politicians. Because many people also see developing life as morally significant, any limits should be narrow, workable, and paired with explicit exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to health, so no one is denied urgent care.
