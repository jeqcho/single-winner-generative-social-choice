    "226": "Public discourse should make space for bold artistic and political expression while narrowly prohibiting direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment that silence or endanger people. Like a concert that balances sound and silence to let every voice be heard, civic spaces require clear, narrowly defined rules that prevent harm without muting uncomfortable but lawful viewpoints. Transparent, evidence\u2011based standards, consistent due process, and emphasis on education, restorative remedies, and vigorous counterspeech\u2014alongside responsible platform and workplace policies\u2014offer a practical path to protect dignity and public safety while preserving robust debate.",
    "607": "Years spent teaching and volunteering show that free speech is vital to learning and democratic life, yet it cannot be a refuge for direct threats, calls to violence, or sustained targeted harassment that strip people of safety and dignity.

Prioritizing community education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech alongside legal remedies helps repair harm and preserve a robust public square.",
    "650": "Free expression must be vigorously protected as the engine of learning and democratic life, yet narrow, clearly defined limits are warranted where speech intentionally threatens, incites imminent violence, or engages in sustained targeted harassment that silences participation. Laws and institutional policies should focus on conduct and demonstrable harm, apply due process, and prioritize education, restorative measures, and robust counterspeech to repair damage while preserving open debate. Clear definitions and transparent enforcement can safeguard vulnerable people\u2014especially children and those in shared community spaces\u2014without enabling sweeping censorship.",
    "623": "Free speech must remain robust to sustain healthy debate and community life, yet narrow, clearly defined limits are warranted when speech intentionally incites imminent violence, issues credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment that undermines safety and equal participation.

Practical, evenly applied standards and community-based responses can protect dignity without becoming tools for partisan suppression.",
    "549": "Free speech should be robustly protected, but narrowly limited when speech intentionally incites imminent violence, issues credible threats, or pursues sustained targeted harassment; those limits must hinge on intent and likelihood of immediate harm, be enforced transparently with due process, and avoid chilling legitimate dissent. Education, restorative community practices, and vigorous counterspeech\u2014like careful tending that nurtures a garden\u2014are the best tools to address hateful ideas and repair harm without broad censorship.",
    "440": "Experience in clinical care and community health suggests that free expression must be vigorously protected to foster debate and healing, while narrowly tailored limits are justified for direct incitement to imminent violence, true threats, and sustained targeted harassment that deprive people of safety and dignity. Combining clear legal standards and due process with education, restorative practices, and robust counterspeech offers a practical middle ground that protects vulnerable people without needlessly stifling legitimate, even uncomfortable, discourse.",
    "597": "Free expression is essential to democratic life, but narrowly tailored legal limits should bar direct incitement to imminent violence, true threats, and sustained targeted harassment that deprive people of safety and equal participation, applied with clear definitions, evidence-based standards, and robust due process. Complementary non\u2011coercive remedies\u2014education, restorative dialogue, vigorous counterspeech, and responsible platform practices informed by technology\u2014should be prioritized to repair harm and change hearts without chilling legitimate, even uncomfortable, debate.",
    "609": "Free expression is foundational to civic life and creative growth, yet it should not be a cover for direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment that silences and harms others. Grounded in empathy and therapeutic practice, narrow, well\u2011defined legal limits based on intent and imminent harm\u2014combined with due process, restorative remedies, education, and vigorous counterspeech\u2014best preserve open debate while protecting safety and dignity.",
    "32": "Free speech is a vital pillar of civic life, yet narrowly tailored limits are appropriate when speech intentionally incites imminent violence, poses credible threats, or sustains targeted harassment that deprives others\u2014especially families and children\u2014of safety and equal participation. Clear legal standards, consistent due process, and an emphasis on education, restorative remedies, and vigorous counterspeech offer practical tools to protect dignity and public safety without needlessly silencing robust or unpopular debate.",
    "501": "Free expression is essential to vibrant debate and community life, yet narrowly targeted limits are justified where speech intentionally threatens, incites imminent violence, or relentlessly harasses and silences people.

    "165": "A practical, workmanlike approach values robust free expression while recognizing that direct threats, imminent calls to violence, and sustained targeted harassment cause real harm and should be narrowly prohibited. Clear, narrowly defined legal standards enforced with due process\u2014complemented by education, restorative practices, counterspeech, and transparent, technology\u2011aware moderation\u2014can protect safety and dignity while preserving vigorous public debate.",
    "773": "A commitment to curiosity, creative exploration, and communal respect supports robust protection for free expression while recognizing limits where speech imminently threatens safety. Narrow, well\u2011defined prohibitions on true threats, incitement to violence, and targeted, sustained harassment\u2014paired with due process, education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech\u2014best balance open debate with protecting vulnerable people.",
    "70": "Free expression should be broadly protected as essential to democracy and communal learning, yet narrowly limited where speech directly incites imminent violence, makes credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment that prevents equal participation. Such limits must be precisely defined and applied with due process and independent oversight, while communities prioritize education, restorative remedies, and vigorous counterspeech to repair harm without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "376": "Free expression must be vigorously protected as the engine of democratic life and artistic inquiry, yet narrow, well\u2011defined limits are justified where speech intentionally incites imminent violence, issues credible threats, or sustains targeted harassment that denies people safety and equal participation. Those limits should be grounded in precise legal definitions, due process, and independent oversight, and complemented by education, restorative practices, platform standards, and robust counterspeech to address prejudice without chilling legitimate debate. A lifelong devotion to literature and careful stewardship of shared public spaces point to balancing open inquiry with practical protections for dignity and public safety, which can unite differing views around clear, proportionate rules.",
    "101": "Free speech should remain broad to sustain debate and accountability, but narrowly constrained where words pose a clear, imminent danger\u2014such as direct calls for violence, credible threats, or coordinated, sustained harassment. Practical, precise legal standards with due process, paired with community norms, education, and restorative remedies, offer common ground that protects safety and dignity without needlessly silencing nonviolent, uncomfortable ideas.",

    "335": "Free expression is essential to democratic life, creativity, and communal problem\u2011solving, yet it must be balanced with a responsibility to protect people\u2014especially children and vulnerable groups\u2014from direct, imminent harms. Narrow, precisely defined limits should prohibit true threats, incitement to imminent violence, and sustained targeted harassment, applied with due process and transparent enforcement to guard against abuse. Complementary investments in education, restorative remedies, platform standards, and vigorous counterspeech can repair harm, uphold dignity, and preserve space for robust, even uncomfortable, debate.",
    "137": "Free expression must remain robust as the foundation of democratic life, yet common-sense, narrowly defined limits are warranted where speech intentionally threatens, incites imminent violence, or engages in sustained targeted harassment that strips people of safety and equal participation. Such limits should be precise, enforced with clear due process and independent oversight, and paired with education, restorative responses, and vigorous counterspeech to protect dignity without needlessly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "244": "Free expression must be vigorously protected as the foundation of democratic life and learning, yet speech that intentionally issues credible threats, incites imminent violence, or coordinates sustained harassment that silences others warrants narrow legal limits to prevent tangible harm.
