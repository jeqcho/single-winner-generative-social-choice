Practical, respectful norms help keep neighborhoods and families safe while preserving honest, sometimes uncomfortable debate.",
    "514": "Free expression must remain robust to sustain community debate and accountability, yet a practical, common\u2011sense approach supports narrow, well\u2011defined limits where speech intentionally incites violence, issues credible threats, or carries out sustained targeted harassment that undermines safety and dignity.

This balance protects families and civic life without surrendering the marketplace of ideas.",
