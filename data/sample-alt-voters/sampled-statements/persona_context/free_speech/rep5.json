    "114": "Public discourse should be like a shared canvas\u2014open to bold, even uncomfortable strokes\u2014yet bounded by narrow, clearly defined limits that prohibit direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment. Those limits must be enforced transparently with due process and paired with education, restorative dialogue, and vigorous counterspeech to protect safety and dignity while preserving creative and political expression.",
    "160": "A free and open exchange of ideas should be robustly protected while recognizing that direct threats, clear incitement to imminent violence, and sustained targeted harassment cause real harm and may justifiably be restricted. Limits must be narrowly and precisely defined, applied with transparent standards and due process to avoid chilling legitimate debate. Where speech falls short of criminality, emphasis should be on education, restorative community responses, counterspeech, and accountable platform and workplace policies to repair harm and strengthen civic trust.",
    "790": "Robust free speech is essential to a healthy public life, but narrowly tailored limits on direct threats, clear incitement to imminent violence, and sustained targeted harassment are justified to protect safety and dignity.

Emphasis should be placed on counterspeech, education, restorative practices, and proportionate platform and institutional responses to address harm while preserving robust debate.",
    "807": "Free speech is essential to democratic life, yet narrowly tailored limits are justified when expression directly and imminently incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or amounts to sustained targeted harassment that denies people safety or equal access. Clear, objective definitions and transparent enforcement with due process, paired with nonlegal responses such as education, counterspeech, restorative practices, and responsible institutional policies, protect dignity without needlessly chilling legitimate debate. Focusing restrictions on harmful conduct rather than unpopular ideas offers a pragmatic path that reconciles commitment to liberty with the duty to safeguard vulnerable community members.",
    "662": "Free speech should be broadly protected as the foundation of honest debate and community life, yet it must not shelter direct threats, clear incitement to imminent violence, or sustained targeted harassment that strips people of safety and dignity. Limits ought to be narrowly defined, applied with transparent due process, and paired with strong community responses\u2014education, restorative dialogue, and vigorous counterspeech\u2014to address prejudice without stifling legitimate expression.

Enforcement should follow due process and precise legal standards, while relying primarily on education, restorative dialogue, counterspeech, and measured platform and workplace policies to address hateful ideas without chilling legitimate debate. Centering community care and equal access to public life helps bridge concerns about liberty and protection so discourse can be both open and safe.",
    "542": "Free speech should be broadly protected to foster open debate and communal growth, yet narrow, clearly defined limits are warranted where speech directly threatens safety, incites imminent violence, or constitutes sustained targeted harassment.

A practical, restorative approach that prevents imminent harm while investing in dialogue and learning can bridge concerns about liberty and protection.",
    "488": "Free speech is essential to a functioning society and honest debate, but it must be balanced with protecting children, neighbors, and public safety from direct harm. Limits should be narrowly tailored to prohibit direct threats, clear incitement to imminent violence, and sustained targeted harassment, applied transparently and with due process so legitimate dissent is not chilled. Where speech falls short of criminality, emphasis should be on education, vigorous counterspeech, workplace and platform accountability, and restorative community remedies that address harm without broad censorship.",
    "105": "Free speech is foundational and must be robustly protected, yet narrow limits are warranted when speech poses a clear, imminent risk through direct threats, incitement to violence, or sustained targeted harassment.

This balanced, stewardship-minded approach preserves open debate while protecting the dignity and safety of vulnerable community members.",
    "12": "A careful balance that preserves robust debate while safeguarding public safety and human dignity is essential.
