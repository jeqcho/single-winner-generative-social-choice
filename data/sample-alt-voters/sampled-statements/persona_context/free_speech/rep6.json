Coordinated public policies and responsible institutional and platform practices can protect dignity and public safety without needlessly silencing legitimate debate.",
    "82": "Free expression should remain robust to fuel innovation, civic debate, and truth\u2011seeking, but narrowly defined limits are justified where speech directly incites imminent violence, makes credible threats, or orchestrates sustained targeted harassment that deprives people of safety or equal participation.

Prioritizing education, restorative dialogue, clear legal standards with due process, and robust counterspeech preserves creative and difficult discourse while repairing harm and preventing overbroad censorship.",
    "306": "Open expression fuels creativity and communal problem\u2011solving, but narrowly tailored limits are justified where speech presents clear, imminent danger\u2014direct threats, coordinated harassment, or calls to violence that silence participation. Emphasizing precise legal standards, due process, and community\u2011based remedies like education, restorative practices, and vigorous counter\u2011speech preserves robust debate while protecting the dignity and safety of those who share public spaces.",
    "522": "Robust free expression must be preserved as the engine of debate, yet narrowly tailored prohibitions on direct threats, credible incitement to imminent violence, and sustained targeted harassment are necessary to protect the dignity and safety of vulnerable people. Enforcement should rest on clear legal standards and due process while being complemented by education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech to repair harm without needlessly chilling legitimate dissent.",
    "258": "Free speech is essential for learning and democratic debate, but narrow, clearly defined limits are warranted where speech directly threatens, incites imminent violence, or engages in sustained targeted harassment\u2014especially when amplified online and when it endangers children or other vulnerable people. Precise legal standards, transparent enforcement with due process, and investments in education, restorative practices, and counterspeech can protect dignity and safety without needlessly silencing legitimate, even uncomfortable, discourse.",
    "377": "Free speech must be fiercely protected as the foundation of open debate, yet narrowly defined limits should apply to direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment that produce imminent harm. Those limits ought to be enforced through clear legal standards and due process, with a preference for proportionate, non\u2011criminal remedies when appropriate. Emphasis on education, restorative practices, counterspeech, and transparent platform and community policies can uphold dignity and public safety while preserving robust, sometimes uncomfortable, debate.",
    "39": "Open expression fuels art, community, and the pursuit of truth, yet narrowly defined limits are warranted where speech intentionally incites imminent violence, makes credible threats, or enacts sustained targeted harassment that strips people of safety and dignity.

Practical, community-centered solutions\u2014including responsible moderation in digital spaces\u2014can protect vulnerable people while preserving room for difficult but necessary discourse.",

    "641": "Grounded in disciplined training, a commitment to protecting families, and respect for open debate, free expression should be broadly defended while drawing narrow, well\u2011defined lines against direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment\u2014especially when children or vulnerable neighbors are at risk. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement with due process, and investments in education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech offer a balanced way to protect safety and dignity without needlessly silencing legitimate disagreement.",

Limits should be narrowly tailored, grounded in clear legal standards and due process, while nonlegal responses\u2014education, restorative practices, and robust counter-speech\u2014are prioritized to heal harm and preserve space for difficult but nonviolent debate. Balancing these approaches helps safeguard vulnerable people, especially children and families, without needlessly silencing honest discourse.",
    "78": "Free speech is essential to democratic life and robust debate, yet narrowly tailored limits are justified to forbid direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and coordinated targeted harassment that place people at real risk.
