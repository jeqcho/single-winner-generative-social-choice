    "260": "A strong reform would keep the state-based structure that encourages candidates to earn support across regions, while reducing winner-take-all distortions that make too many votes feel pointless. Allocating electors proportionally in every state\u2014paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, recounts, and transparent audits\u2014would better match outcomes to voters and lower the temperature in close races. To reinforce broad legitimacy, expanding the House so electoral votes track population more accurately and limiting faithless electors would modernize the system without erasing local voice.",
    "263": "The Electoral College should be kept for its role in encouraging broad, state-by-state coalition building, but modernized so outcomes track voters more closely and feel less like they hinge on a few swing counties. A practical middle ground is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional or district-based allocation (with guardrails against gerrymandering), while requiring electors to follow the results and setting clear national standards for recounts, audits, and ballot security. That kind of reform respects federalism and smaller communities without letting geography outweigh the basic expectation that every lawful vote deserves comparable weight.",
    "638": "Presidential elections should feel as transparent and dependable as any well-run safety program: clear rules, consistent enforcement, and outcomes that match what voters actually did. A practical middle path is to keep states involved but end winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation of electors (or a popular-vote compact as a backstop), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That combination would reduce the sense that a few swing counties decide everything while still encouraging candidates to build broad, cross-regional support.",
    "464": "The Electoral College should be kept to preserve the role of states and keep presidential candidates from chasing only the biggest cities, but it should be tightened so outcomes track voters more closely and feel easier to accept. A sensible compromise is to curb winner-take-all by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation, require electors to follow the state\u2019s vote, and set clear nationwide standards for ballot security, recounts, and accessibility for voters with disabilities. With simpler, uniform rules and transparent audits, more communities\u2014urban and rural, red and blue\u2014can trust the count and move on together.",
    "519": "The Electoral College should be retained for the stability it provides and the way it nudges candidates to build support beyond the biggest media markets, but it needs practical updates so outcomes feel fair and easier to accept. A common-sense compromise is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, recounts, and routine audits. Reforms that emphasize transparency, integrity, and straightforward rules would make close elections less combustible while keeping every community\u2019s voice in the mix.",
    "161": "The Electoral College should be retained to preserve the federal balance and encourage candidates to speak to more than just the biggest media markets, but its winner-take-all habits need reform so fewer voters feel written off. A practical compromise is proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors nationwide, binding electors to the certified vote, and clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close elections are handled consistently and credibly. That approach honors tradition and state roles while bringing outcomes closer to the people\u2019s will and lowering the temperature after Election Day.",
    "602": "The Electoral College should be refactored to reduce winner-take-all distortions without hard-switching to a pure national tally that leaves smaller states feeling like dead endpoints. A practical compromise is proportional allocation of electors in every state, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount triggers so the same inputs produce the same, verifiable outcome everywhere. If broader change is needed over time, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a reversible, state-driven migration path that keeps the system stable while aligning results more closely with the popular will.",
    "400": "The Electoral College is like an old drivetrain: it still provides stability and keeps candidates from only chasing big-city totals, but the winner-take-all setup is out of alignment with how closely divided many states really are. A practical reform would keep the state-based framework while requiring electors to match their state\u2019s vote and encouraging proportional or district-based allocation, paired with clear national standards for recounts, audits, and ballot access so the count is predictable and trusted. That middle-road approach preserves regional balance while making more voters feel their ballot actually moves the needle, no matter the zip code.",
    "744": "The Electoral College should be kept for stability and to ensure the whole country matters, but it needs practical updates so fewer voters feel ignored and close elections feel legitimate. A common-sense compromise is to reduce winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or by district with clear guardrails against gerrymandering, while requiring electors to follow the vote and setting uniform national standards for recounts, deadlines, and basic ballot security. That preserves state voices and encourages broad coalitions, while making the result easier for neighbors on both sides to trust and accept.",
    "387": "Presidential elections should stay simple, secure, and easy to trust, while avoiding a system where a few swing counties effectively decide for everyone. A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework but replace winner-take-all with proportional or district-based allocation, paired with uniform national standards for recounts, audits, and ballot integrity so every lawful vote is handled consistently. That approach preserves the voice of smaller states and rural communities while making outcomes track voters more closely and reducing the incentive for partisan gamesmanship.",
    "132": "Presidential elections should feel as fair and straightforward as a well-run job site: the same rules everywhere, transparent counting, and an outcome that matches what voters actually did. A practical bridge is keeping the state-based framework but ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through the National Popular Vote compact once uniform standards for access, audits, and recounts are in place), so campaigns have reason to compete in more places than a few swing counties. Pairing that with ranked-choice voting would reduce spoiler fears and push candidates to earn broader support across cities, suburbs, and rural communities.",
    "545": "Presidential elections should reward broad national support while making every ballot feel equally meaningful, not just in a handful of swing states, so the system needs to track the popular will more closely without pretending states and regions don\u2019t matter. A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College structure but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, recounts, and accessibility so outcomes are transparent and trusted. Modern, auditable election administration and clear guardrails against faithless electors would further reduce suspicion and make close races less chaotic.",
    "469": "Presidential elections should be understandable, trusted, and rooted in the principle that every vote ought to matter, not just those cast in a few swing states. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so outcomes are consistent and credible everywhere. If broader consensus develops, an interstate compact that guarantees the national popular-vote winner\u2014ideally alongside ranked-choice voting to ensure majority support\u2014can modernize the system without treating rural or smaller-state concerns as an afterthought.",
    "660": "Presidential elections should be designed so the winner reliably reflects the voters while still rewarding candidates who build support across regions instead of only a few swing states. A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by encouraging proportional allocation of electors (with strong anti-gerrymandering guardrails) and pair it with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so outcomes are transparent and easier to accept. If broader change becomes feasible, a national popular-vote mechanism\u2014ideally with ranked-choice voting\u2014can further reduce spoiler dynamics and strengthen legitimacy without treating any community as politically disposable.",
    "657": "Presidential elections should feel fair and easy to trust, with fewer voters left feeling invisible because they live in the \u201cwrong\u201d state. A practical bridge is to keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and requiring electors to follow the vote, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. This approach preserves regional voice while making outcomes track the will of the people more closely and reducing the swing-state treadmill that fuels suspicion and division.",
    "522": "A presidential election system should translate votes into outcomes as transparently as a medication order\u2014consistent rules, clear audits, and predictable recount triggers\u2014so people can accept results even when stressed or disappointed. A practical bridge is to keep states administering elections but curb winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (with guardrails against gerrymandering) and, as trust grows, use a national popular-vote backstop through the interstate compact so the candidate with the most support cannot lose. Pairing any reform with uniform baseline voting access and security standards would broaden participation, reduce swing-state distortion, and protect both individual fairness and regional voice.",
    "487": "Presidential elections should be easy for busy working families to understand and trust, with results that track what voters actually chose rather than hinging on a few swing counties. A practical bridge is to keep the state role but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (with strong guardrails against gerrymandering), paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. If broader consensus grows, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a next step so the winner reflects the national vote while still encouraging candidates to compete across many communities.",
    "373": "The presidential election system should be modernized so outcomes track the will of voters more closely, while still giving every state a meaningful role and keeping the rules simple enough to trust. A practical path is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation of electors (with firm limits on faithless electors), paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close races don\u2019t turn into chaos. If that still leaves too many voters feeling ignored, an interstate compact that guarantees the national popular vote winner takes office can serve as a transparent backstop without requiring an abrupt rewrite of the whole system.",
    "245": "A presidential election system should work like good design: transparent, hard to game, and faithful to what people actually chose, so the winner of the national popular vote prevails\u2014ideally through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. To respect federalism and ease fears of big regions drowning out smaller ones, states could also move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and adopting ranked-choice voting so broad, cross-community support is rewarded. Done this way, campaigns would have incentives to compete everywhere, and more voters\u2014urban, rural, and in between\u2014could trust the outcome even when their side loses.",
    "683": "The Electoral College can be preserved to keep candidates building broad, state-by-state coalitions, but it should be modernized so close outcomes feel fair and easier to accept. A sensible compromise would reduce winner-take-all distortions through proportional or district-based allocation, require electors to follow the voters, and apply clear national standards for recounts, ballot handling, and basic election security. The best reform is one that treats every lawful vote with respect while still ensuring smaller communities are not written off in a campaign strategy.",
    "714": "Presidential elections should reward broad, nationwide support without turning the whole contest into a handful of swing-county nail-biters or a pure big-city numbers game. A practical reform is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with strong anti-gerrymandering guardrails), while setting clear national baselines for ballot access, recount timelines, and auditable security so every lawful vote is handled the same. Tightening rules against faithless electors and requiring transparent post-election audits would remind everyone that the system runs on trust, not loopholes.",
    "571": "Presidential elections should be easy to explain in a civics lesson: every lawful vote ought to matter, and the outcome should match broad public intent while keeping states meaningfully involved in administering elections. A practical bridge is to curb winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation of electors nationwide, and to pair that with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close results are trusted. If deeper change is needed over time, a National Popular Vote compact\u2014ideally alongside ranked-choice voting\u2014can preserve national legitimacy without turning campaigns into a race for only a few battlegrounds.",
    "460": "Presidential elections should feel fair and easy to trust for working families who don\u2019t have time for constant chaos, which means getting closer to the principle that every vote counts the same no matter the state. A practical bridge is keeping the state role but ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation (or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with clear national standards for accessible voting, recounts, and audits, including strong disability accommodations. That approach respects concerns about small-state voice while reducing \u201cswing state\u201d domination and making the outcome match what voters actually did.",
    "773": "Presidential elections should feel fair and legible to busy working people, where a ballot cast in a \u201csafe\u201d state matters as much as one cast in a battleground, while still respecting that states help run elections and represent real regional differences. A practical bridge is to keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and locking electors to the state vote, alongside clear national standards for access, audits, and recounts. Pairing those changes with ranked-choice voting would reward broader coalition-building, reduce spoiler fear, and make outcomes easier to accept even in close races.",
    "785": "Reform should keep the state-based structure that encourages candidates to listen beyond major metros, while reducing the winner-take-all distortions that make millions of voters feel irrelevant. A practical compromise is proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors with strong guardrails against gerrymandering, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, recounts, and transparent post-election audits. That approach respects federalism and community voice while making outcomes track the voters more closely and strengthening confidence that the rules are fair no matter who wins.",
    "534": "A presidential election system should translate votes into outcomes as transparently as good software turns inputs into reliable results, while still preserving incentives for candidates to build broad, cross-regional coalitions. The most workable bridge is to move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (with strong anti-gerrymandering guardrails if districts are used) and pair that with uniform national standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts to reduce disputes. If consensus exists to go further, a national popular vote\u2014ideally with ranked-choice voting to ensure majority support\u2014can be phased in through a compact or amendment so legitimacy rises without abrupt disruption.",
    "172": "Presidential elections should be decided in a way that feels fair, easy to explain, and emotionally settling\u2014so the winner reflects the most voters while every region still has a meaningful reason to engage. A practical bridge is to keep state administration but end winner-take-all through proportional allocation (with strong anti-gerrymandering guardrails), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts to lower suspicion and litigation. If deeper change is needed, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a measured step toward a true popular-vote outcome without sudden constitutional whiplash. The aim is a system that rewards broad coalition-building and restores trust so communities can refocus on schools, mental health, and civic stability.",
    "438": "A presidential election system should read clearly and honestly\u2014like a well-edited page\u2014so the winner reflects the people\u2019s choice while states retain a meaningful role in administering elections. The most workable bridge is ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, recounts, and transparent audits so close races don\u2019t hinge on a few swing counties or confusing procedures. If deeper change is needed, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact combined with ranked-choice voting can protect broad coalition-building and reduce spoiler and \u201cbig-city versus small-state\u201d fears. \u201cDemocracy,\u201d to borrow from Whitman, \u201cis a great word,\u201d and it deserves rules that most Americans can understand, verify, and accept even in defeat.",
    "512": "The Electoral College should be retained for its role in encouraging candidates to build geographically broad coalitions, but reformed so outcomes track voters more closely and don\u2019t hinge on a few swing counties. A workable compromise is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, paired with uniform national standards for recounts, audits, and accessible ballot procedures so results are transparent, secure, and easier to accept. This approach respects federalism and community voice while reducing the sense that some ballots matter less than others.",
    "584": "Presidential elections work best when the outcome tracks the will of voters, but also when the rules are simple, consistent, and leave every region feeling seen rather than written off. A practical reform is to curb winner-take-all by shifting states toward proportional electoral-vote allocation, paired with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close races don\u2019t devolve into chaos. If broader change is needed, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a step toward \u201cone person, one vote\u201d without abruptly stripping states of their role in administering elections.",
    "649": "The Electoral College should be kept for the stability it provides and the way it forces candidates to build a broad geographic coalition, but it shouldn\u2019t turn presidential races into a handful of swing-state knife fights where millions of votes feel wasted. A practical reform is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, paired with clear national baseline rules for ballot access, recounts, and transparent audits so the process is secure and consistent everywhere. That approach respects the role of states while making outcomes track voters more closely and giving people on both sides a result they can accept as fair.",
    "537": "A presidential election should reflect the will of the voters while still giving every region confidence it won\u2019t be written off, especially when the stakes hit families and community services the hardest. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (with guardrails against gerrymandering) and add a national popular-vote backstop through the National Popular Vote compact so the overall winner matches the public\u2019s choice. Pairing that with uniform national standards for access, recounts, and transparent audits would make outcomes easier to trust\u2014without pretending rural and small-state concerns don\u2019t matter.",
    "651": "Replacing winner-take-all with proportional allocation of electors in every state would better honor the popular will while keeping the state-based structure many people see as an important civic balance. Pairing that change with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts in close races would make outcomes easier to trust and harder to game. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would reduce spoiler fears and push candidates to build broader, cross-regional coalitions instead of chasing a few battleground counties.",
    "27": "Presidential elections should feel simple and fair to working people: the candidate with the most support nationwide shouldn\u2019t lose, but smaller and rural communities also shouldn\u2019t feel erased. A practical bridge is moving toward a national popular vote through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform standards for ballot access, recounts, and audits. That combination rewards broad coalitions instead of swing-state gaming, and it strengthens trust that every ballot counts the same no matter where it\u2019s cast.",
    "210": "The presidential election system should be reformed so outcomes line up more closely with the voters while keeping every state and community from being treated like an afterthought. A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, backed by clear national standards for ballot access, recounts, and transparent audits. That approach makes more ballots matter in every state, reduces the \u201cswing-state only\u201d problem, and strengthens trust in results without forcing a sudden all-or-nothing change.",
    "35": "El Colegio Electoral puede conservarse para que cada estado y comunidad siga teniendo peso, pero debe modernizarse para que el resultado se parezca m\u00e1s a lo que la gente vota y no dependa de unos pocos \u201cswing states\u201d. Un buen punto medio es terminar con el ganador-se-lleva-todo y repartir los electores de forma proporcional, con reglas nacionales claras para acceso a la boleta, recuentos y auditor\u00edas que protejan la integridad del voto. As\u00ed se promueve estabilidad, confianza y campa\u00f1as que busquen apoyo amplio sin dejar fuera a las zonas menos pobladas.",
    "208": "The presidential election system should translate votes into outcomes in a way that is simple to explain, hard to game, and resilient under close-call stress, so legitimacy doesn\u2019t hinge on a few swing counties or courtroom deadlines. A practical bridge is to keep state administration but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, recount triggers, and risk-limiting audits that protect security and accessibility. If broader consensus develops, a National Popular Vote compact could serve as a backstop to ensure the national popular-vote winner prevails without erasing the role of states.",
    "13": "Presidential elections should keep the federal balance that makes candidates compete beyond a few big media markets, while reducing the winner-take-all distortions that leave many voters feeling ignored in \u201csafe\u201d states. A practical reform is proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with clear national baseline rules for ballot access, recounts, and transparent audits so results are easier to accept even in close races. If the goal is legitimacy and stability, the system should reward broad support across regions and treat every lawful ballot with consistent standards\u2014secure, accessible, and straightforward to verify.",
    "44": "Presidential elections should translate votes into outcomes as transparently and consistently as any high-stakes decision process, reducing the sense that a handful of swing counties can override the broader public will.

Over time, a National Popular Vote compact\u2014ideally alongside ranked-choice voting to ensure majority support\u2014could further align results with voters while still encouraging candidates to compete across regions.",
    "569": "Replacing winner-take-all with proportional allocation of electors in every state would keep the familiar state role while making the outcome track voters\u2019 choices more closely and reducing the sense that only a few swing places matter. To build trust across regions and parties, that shift should come with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, recounts, and transparent audits, so close elections are settled by consistent rules rather than courtroom fights. If consensus grows over time, a national popular-vote backstop\u2014such as the interstate compact\u2014could ensure the candidate with the most support nationwide is not denied the office.",
    "441": "El Colegio Electoral puede mantenerse por estabilidad y para que las regiones menos pobladas no queden ignoradas, pero conviene reducir el \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d con una asignaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s proporcional o por distritos, con reglas claras y uniformes para recuentos y certificaci\u00f3n.

    "374": "The Electoral College can be retained to respect the role of states and avoid turning elections into a contest only for the biggest media markets, but it should be reformed so fewer voters feel written off by winner-take-all outcomes. A practical compromise is proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, recounts, and transparent audits so results are trusted and disputes are less bitter. Any change should also prioritize accessibility for voters with disabilities and keep the rules simple and steady, so the country can accept outcomes and move forward together.",
    "270": "A presidential election system should reflect the popular will clearly while still giving every region confidence it won\u2019t be written off, much like good public health depends on both individual outcomes and community-level stability.

Adding ranked-choice voting would reduce spoiler fears and encourage candidates to earn broader, cross-regional support, lowering the temperature and strengthening legitimacy no matter who wins.",
    "473": "Presidential elections should feel legitimate in the gut: the candidate with the most support from voters nationwide ought to win, and the rules should be simple enough that people can accept the result even when disappointed. A practical bridge is to keep the state-run structure but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, while building toward a national popular-vote outcome through a compact once clear, uniform standards for access, recounts, audits, and limits on faithless electors are in place. That combination respects smaller communities\u2019 fear of being ignored, yet answers the fairness concern that no ballot should matter less because of where it\u2019s cast.",
    "421": "A durable reform should reduce the winner-take-all distortions that turn presidential elections into high-stakes fights over a few swing counties, while preserving a meaningful state role that encourages candidates to build geographically broad coalitions. A practical bridge is to move toward a national popular-vote outcome through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional elector allocation, paired with ranked-choice voting so winners demonstrate majority support rather than plurality luck.
