    "87": "Elections should make every vote carry roughly equal weight while preserving states' meaningful role, so a patient, practical path\u2014like proportional allocation of electors or an interstate compact to honor the national popular vote, paired with ranked\u2011choice ballots\u2014can encourage broader coalition\u2011building. Uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and clear recount rules will build trust across urban and rural communities so results feel legitimate rather than a partisan prize.",
    "104": "Elections must be orderly and trusted, so preserve the state-based framework while reducing winner-take-all distortions through proportional or district-based allocation of electors, stronger bans on faithless electors, and uniform nationwide standards for ballot access, paper trails, audits, and recounts. Any move toward a national popular vote should be phased and contingent on those clear, auditable safeguards to protect smaller states\u2019 voice and public confidence.",
    "135": "Elections must be clearly administered so every lawful vote matters while preserving a meaningful role for states; practical reforms could phase in proportional or district-based allocation of electors or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact rather than an abrupt constitutional overhaul. Pairing any change with uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, automatic recount triggers, and stronger safeguards against faithless electors will build trust and encourage candidates to compete nationwide rather than only in a handful of swing states.",
    "168": "Elections should make every lawful vote carry comparable weight while preserving the federal role of states and protecting smaller communities from being ignored. Practical reforms\u2014such as proportional or district allocation of electors, a carefully phased interstate popular\u2011vote compact or ranked\u2011choice voting, and national standards for ballot access, paper audit trails, and automatic recounts\u2014can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, encourage campaigns to compete broadly, and rebuild public trust.",
    "191": "Stable, straightforward rules that make every lawful vote carry comparable weight while preserving states\u2019 meaningful role offer the best path forward. A practical, phased approach\u2014such as encouraging proportional allocation or the National Popular Vote compact alongside uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and clear recount triggers\u2014can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and rebuild public trust. Emphasis on transparency, simple administration, and incentives for candidates to campaign broadly can bridge urban and rural concerns without upending the constitutional framework.",
    "745": "A well-designed election system should make every lawful vote carry comparable weight while preserving the meaningful role states play in administering contests. Practical reforms\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors or an interstate popular-vote compact implemented alongside ranked-choice ballots, uniform ballot-access and recount standards, paper-audit trails, and stronger anti\u2011faithless\u2011elector rules\u2014would reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, incentivize campaigning across the country, and rebuild confidence in close results.",

These measured reforms would encourage candidates to campaign broadly, protect smaller communities, and rebuild public trust so families and communities can rely on stable, fair leadership.",
    "519": "Election rules should preserve the constitutional role of states while making every lawful vote matter more equally, for example by moving away from winner\u2011take\u2011all toward proportional or district allocation of electors and imposing clear national standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, recount triggers, and penalties for faithless electors. Reforms ought to be phased and transparent\u2014using an interstate compact or other incremental measures\u2014so trust can be built across regions and candidates are incentivized to campaign broadly rather than focus on a handful of swing states.",

Pursuing practical reforms\u2014uniform standards for access, auditable paper trails, limits on faithless electors, and a phased move toward proportional allocation or an interstate compact tied to a national popular or ranked\u2011choice tally\u2014can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and reward candidates who build broad, cross\u2011region coalitions.",
    "259": "Elections should be fair, transparent, and practical, producing outcomes that reflect the national popular will while preserving a meaningful role for states and protecting smaller communities. A pragmatic, phased reform\u2014using interstate popular\u2011vote compacts or proportional/district allocation of electors combined with ranked\u2011choice options and uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts\u2014can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, encourage campaigning everywhere, and rebuild trust across divides.",
    "803": "A practical, data-driven path balances the constitutional role of states with the principle that every lawful vote should carry comparable weight by adopting measures like proportional allocation of electors or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact\u2014ideally paired with ranked\u2011choice ballots to reduce spoiler effects. Implementing uniform, auditable standards for ballot access, recounts, and election security, protections against faithless electors, and a phased rollout will preserve federalism while building the transparency and public trust needed for durable reform.",
    "374": "Elections should make every vote feel meaningful while preserving the states\u2019 role and protecting smaller and rural communities, so practical, incremental reforms are preferable to radical change. Measures such as proportional allocation of electors or a carefully phased interstate popular\u2011vote compact, paired with ranked\u2011choice ballots, uniform standards for ballot access, and robust audits and faithless\u2011elector protections, can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and encourage broader, more trustworthy campaigns. Any change should be implemented cautiously and transparently so stability, fairness, and public confidence are preserved.",
    "107": "Elections should be run on clear, enforceable rules that make every lawful vote carry comparable weight while preserving the federal framework that ensures smaller communities are heard. Practical, phased reforms\u2014like proportional allocation of electors or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact paired with ranked\u2011choice options, mandatory paper trails, uniform audits, and consistent recount triggers\u2014would reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, encourage nationwide campaigning, and rebuild public trust without upending state administration.",
    "764": "Elections should be tended like a communal garden: preserve the structure that protects smaller plots while pruning winner\u2011take\u2011all rules that let a few beds dominate the view. A practical compromise is to keep state-based administration but shift toward proportional or district allocation of electors and require nationwide standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and automatic recount triggers to restore confidence and encourage campaigns to cultivate voters everywhere.",
    "752": "Elections ought to make every lawful vote carry comparable weight while preserving states\u2019 practical role in administering them; a sensible compromise is to move away from winner\u2011take\u2011all toward proportional or district\u2011based elector allocation and to pursue a national popular\u2011vote compact only alongside uniform, auditable standards for ballot access, recounts, and election security. Those steps would encourage candidates to campaign broadly, protect smaller and rural communities from being ignored, and rebuild public confidence through clear, predictable procedures.",
    "19": "Elections should be simple, transparent, and fair so every ballot matters without turning campaigns into a handful of swing\u2011state contests. Preserve state administration but reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014through proportional or district allocation, or an interstate compact honoring the national popular vote\u2014paired with uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and protections against faithless electors. Those changes would reward broad coalition\u2011building, protect smaller communities\u2019 voice, and make outcomes easier for working families to trust.",
    "238": "Elections should preserve states\u2019 meaningful role while ensuring each citizen\u2019s ballot carries comparable weight to rebuild trust. A phased plan that encourages proportional or district-based elector allocation, an interstate popular\u2011vote compact or national ranked\u2011choice option, and uniform, auditable standards for access, recounts, and security balances federalism with fairness. Clear safeguards and a transparent transition timeline can help build bipartisan confidence and encourage candidates to compete broadly rather than only in a few swing areas.",
    "789": "Elections should preserve the role of states and geographic balance while making every lawful vote carry comparable weight, so outcomes are both fair and widely trusted. A practical, incremental path\u2014phasing in proportional or district-based allocation or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact\u2014paired with uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and clear recount rules would reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and shore up confidence. Such measured reforms respect federalism, encourage broader coalition\u2011building, and help the country accept results without needless rancor.",
    "255": "A fair and trusted presidential system should make every vote carry comparable weight while preserving states' meaningful role in administering elections; practical, incremental reforms\u2014such as proportional or district allocation of electors, targeted adoption of ranked\u2011choice ballots, or an interstate compact tied to clear standards\u2014offer workable bridges rather than a sudden overhaul. Pairing those changes with uniform rules for ballot access, auditable paper trails, protections against faithless electors, and automatic recount triggers would reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, encourage nationwide campaigning, and rebuild confidence across urban, suburban, and rural communities.",

Clear, uniform protections for ballot access, paper audits, transparent recount rules, and explicit safeguards for smaller and marginalized communities will build trust, encourage campaigning across the country, and strengthen the legitimacy of outcomes.",
    "264": "Grounded in a steady, observant approach that values clarity and trust, reforms should make every lawful vote carry comparable weight while preserving a meaningful role for states. Practical changes\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors or an interstate compact to honor the national popular vote, paired with ranked\u2011choice ballots, uniform standards for access and robust audits\u2014would reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and rebuild confidence in close results.",
    "188": "Elections should preserve a meaningful role for states while making sure each lawful ballot carries similar weight, because clear, fair rules build the public trust needed for stable outcomes. A practical compromise is to phase in reforms\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact\u2014paired with uniform ballot\u2011access rules, paper\u2011trail audits, and transparent recount procedures so results are easy to understand, hard to game, and acceptable to communities large and small.",
    "268": "A sensible path balances respect for the states with the principle that each lawful vote should carry similar weight, favoring incremental reforms that reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014such as proportional allocation by state or congressional district\u2014while allowing an interstate compact or national popular\u2011vote mechanism if paired with clear safeguards. Uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, timely recount procedures, and stronger protections against faithless electors are essential to build broad trust. Such pragmatic changes would reward coalition\u2011building, protect smaller communities, and make outcomes easier for the public to accept.",
    "240": "A durable reform balances the need for every lawful vote to carry similar weight with preserving the federal structure that encourages nationwide coalition-building and political stability. Practical, phased changes\u2014such as proportional or district allocation of electors, an interstate compact tied to a clear popular\u2011vote trigger or ranked\u2011choice tally, uniform standards for ballot access and auditable paper trails, and stricter rules against faithless electors\u2014can build bipartisan trust while avoiding a sudden, destabilizing overhaul.",
    "604": "A practical reform would preserve the state-based framework while ensuring each vote carries more equal weight\u2014for example through proportional allocation of electors or a phased National Popular Vote compact paired with ranked\u2011choice options. Such changes must be coupled with uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and clear recount rules so the process is transparent, hard to game, and incentivizes candidates to compete broadly rather than just in a few swing states.",
    "634": "Elections should make each lawful vote carry comparable weight while preserving a meaningful role for states and smaller communities, so reforms must be practical, limited, and trust-building rather than purely partisan. A balanced path is to phase in measures like proportional or district-based elector allocation (or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact with a clear activation threshold), paired with ranked\u2011choice options, uniform standards for ballot access and auditable paper trails, automatic recount triggers, and stronger limits on faithless electors to protect legitimacy and encourage candidates to compete broadly.",
    "119": "Presidential elections should ensure each lawful vote carries comparable weight while preserving a meaningful role for states and smaller communities. A practical pathway blends proportional allocation or a phased interstate popular\u2011vote compact with ranked\u2011choice options and national safeguards\u2014auditable paper trails, uniform recount triggers, and limits on faithless electors\u2014so outcomes are transparent, secure, and reward broad coalition\u2011building. Changes ought to be incremental and verifiable to build trust across regions rather than advantage any one party.",
    "550": "Elections should be straightforward, transparent, and feel fair to voters everywhere, so reforms ought to make each ballot carry comparable weight while preserving the role of states and the stability of the system. A practical path is phased, commonsense changes\u2014such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors, a carefully implemented interstate popular-vote compact or ranked-choice tally, and uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and faithless\u2011elector protections\u2014to reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and rebuild public trust.",
    "729": "Elections should make every vote carry equal weight while preserving a meaningful role for states, so practical reform could pair an interstate compact or proportional/district allocation of electors with ranked\u2011choice voting to encourage broader, more inclusive majorities. Any change must be accompanied by uniform, transparent standards for ballot access, audits, recounts, and stronger protections against faithless electors, phased in to build trust across urban and rural communities.",
    "425": "Preserving the states\u2019 role while making each lawful vote carry comparable weight offers the most practical path forward. A phased approach\u2014via an interstate compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with ranked\u2011choice ballots and clear nationwide standards for ballot access, paper audits, and recount triggers\u2014can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, encourage broader campaigning, and build the transparent, trustworthy procedures needed for lasting bipartisan confidence.",
    "373": "A modernized system should marry a national popular outcome with the federal role of states by pursuing a phased interstate compact or proportional allocation of electors, complemented by ranked-choice voting to ensure broad majority support. Clear, uniform rules for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and firm protections against faithless electors will restore confidence and incentivize candidates to campaign across the whole country rather than just a few battlegrounds.",
    "776": "Reforms should preserve states\u2019 role while making each lawful vote carry more equal weight by pairing uniform national standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and clear recount triggers with a move away from winner\u2011take\u2011all toward proportional or district-based allocation. A phased, evidence\u2011driven approach\u2014piloting proportional/district methods and ranked\u2011choice ballots, then adopting an interstate compact to honor the national popular vote once safeguards prove reliable\u2014can reduce swing\u2011state distortion, limit faithless electors, and build broad, practical trust without discarding federalist principles.",
    "631": "Preserving the states\u2019 role while making each ballot carry more equal weight offers the most practical path forward; a phased approach\u2014such as proportional allocation or a carefully staged National Popular Vote compact combined with ranked\u2011choice ballots\u2014can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions without upending federalism. Any change must be paired with uniform standards for ballot access, paper trails, automatic audits, and clear recount rules so families and communities everywhere can trust results and expect candidates to compete beyond a handful of swing locales.",
    "192": "Elections should produce outcomes that reflect the national popular will while preserving the meaningful role of states in administering them. A pragmatic path is a phased reform that reduces winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014through proportional or district allocation of electors, or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact with ranked\u2011choice safeguards\u2014paired with uniform standards, auditable paper trails, and clear recount triggers to build trust. Emphasizing transparent, technology\u2011assisted audits and simple, enforceable rules will encourage broad participation, reward coalition\u2011building, and make results easier for communities across the country to accept.",
    "345": "Practical reform should make every lawful vote carry roughly equal weight while preserving the role of states and encouraging candidates to listen beyond a handful of swing areas.

Centering transparency, nonpartisan administration, and safeguards for smaller or historically underrepresented communities can build the broad confidence needed for durable change.",
    "725": "Elections should make every lawful vote carry comparable weight while preserving the federal structure that keeps smaller and rural communities heard and national stability intact. A practical bridge is to curb winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014through proportional or district allocation or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact with ranked\u2011choice safeguards\u2014while instituting uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, clear recount triggers, and protections for deployed and overseas voters and against faithless electors.",
    "799": "Stable, trustworthy elections should make every lawful vote feel meaningful while preserving the federal balance that protects smaller communities. A practical path pairs modest modernization\u2014such as proportional or district allocation of electors and stronger limits on faithless electors\u2014with national standards for ballot access, paper audits, and recounts, implemented gradually (for example through interstate compacts) to build confidence. That blend honors tradition, reduces winner-take-all distortions, and prioritizes transparency and security so results are broadly accepted.",

Practical, incremental reforms\u2014such as proportional or district allocation of electors, a carefully phased interstate compact honoring the national popular vote, and wider use of ranked\u2011choice voting\u2014paired with uniform standards for ballot access, paper trails, and transparent audits would reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and bolster public trust. Change ought to arrive with clear, enforceable rules and a deliberate transition so stability is maintained and confidence in outcomes grows across the political divide.",

Uniform, technology-enabled but paper-auditable standards for ballot access, recount triggers, and post\u2011election audits, along with explicit accommodations for voters with disabilities and protections for smaller states\u2019 voices, will strengthen trust and produce outcomes that are secure, transparent, and widely accepted.",
