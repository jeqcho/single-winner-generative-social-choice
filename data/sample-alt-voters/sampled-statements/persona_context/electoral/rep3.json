    "391": "The Electoral College can be kept as a guardrail for regional balance, but it should be tuned so the outcome tracks voter intent more closely and campaigns have reasons to compete beyond a few swing states. A practical compromise is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional or district-based elector allocation, combined with clear nationwide baselines for ballot rules, audits, and recount triggers so results are easier to verify and accept. That approach respects smaller communities while honoring the plain idea that every lawful vote should carry meaningful weight and be counted under consistent, trusted rules.",
    "259": "The best reform keeps the state-based structure people trust while making results line up more closely with how voters actually cast their ballots. A practical middle ground is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or a carefully designed national popular-vote compact), paired with uniform national standards for ballots, audits, and recounts so outcomes are clear and hard to game. That approach protects smaller communities from being ignored, reduces the \u201cswing state\u201d problem, and strengthens confidence that every lawful vote truly matters.",
    "698": "Reform should be careful and steady: keep a state-based role so smaller communities are not ignored, but reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all by allocating electors proportionally and requiring electors to follow the voters\u2019 choice. Clear, uniform national rules for ballot design, counting, audits, and recounts would make results easier to trust and accept. This kind of change respects tradition and stability while making more votes meaningful in every state, not only in a few swing places.",
    "763": "Presidential elections should better honor the principle that every vote carries comparable weight while still respecting states\u2019 real role in administering elections and ensuring broad geographic legitimacy. A practical bridge is to keep state-run voting but end winner\u2011take\u2011all through proportional allocation of electors or adoption of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with ranked\u2011choice voting to reward consensus candidates. Whatever the mechanism, uniform baseline standards for access, auditing, and recounts would reduce mistrust and make outcomes easier to accept across urban and rural communities.",
    "15": "Electoral College reform should preserve a meaningful role for states and smaller communities while reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions so the outcome more consistently reflects the voters\u2019 choice. A practical middle path is proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors paired with uniform, auditable national standards for ballot rules, recounts, and election security. That combination respects local voice and personal freedom, avoids endless swing\u2011state targeting, and strengthens public trust without a sudden constitutional rupture.",
    "533": "The Electoral College shouldn\u2019t be scrapped overnight, but it should be tightened so the winner lines up more consistently with what voters actually chose and so campaigns aren\u2019t just chasing a few swing spots. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by moving to proportional or district-based electoral votes, require electors to follow the vote, and set clear national baseline rules for audits, recounts, and ballot handling that both parties can trust. That keeps the state-based balance many people value while making every lawful vote matter more and reducing the feeling that the system is being gamed.",
    "526": "The Electoral College still serves a purpose in forcing presidents to build broad coalitions across states, but winner-take-all outcomes and inconsistent election rules have made the system feel like a high-stakes gamble decided by a few battlegrounds. A practical reform is to keep the state-based structure while requiring electors to follow the statewide vote and allocating electoral votes proportionally, paired with uniform national standards for ballot integrity, audits, and recounts. That approach respects federalism and rural concerns while making results track voter intent more closely and giving the country clearer, more defensible outcomes.",
    "747": "Presidential elections should reward the candidate who earns the most support from voters nationwide, while keeping states central in how elections are run and audited so the process stays transparent and trusted. A practical compromise is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional elector allocation to end winner-take-all distortions, paired with uniform baseline standards for ballot access, paper trails, and automatic recounts in close races. That way campaigns have to compete everywhere\u2014not just a few swing states\u2014without leaving rural or smaller communities feeling erased.",
    "197": "Presidential elections should better reflect the national popular will while keeping states central to administering elections and maintaining broad geographic legitimacy. A practical bridge is adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and clear recount triggers. Adding ranked-choice voting or a runoff mechanism would reduce spoiler dynamics and reward candidates who build wide, cross-regional coalitions. The test of any reform is whether it makes every ballot feel meaningful in every state while lowering distrust and the temperature of close elections.",
    "690": "Presidential elections should better reflect the national popular will while keeping states central to administering secure, transparent voting\u2014much like good environmental stewardship balances local habitats with the larger ecosystem. A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with uniform baseline standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. Adding ranked-choice voting or a runoff would reduce spoiler fears and reward candidates who can build broader, cross\u2011regional coalitions.",
    "744": "A sensible reform would keep the states\u2019 role in holding the country together, but reduce the winner-take-all feel so fewer voters are written off and the result lines up better with what people actually chose. Allocating electoral votes proportionally (or with a careful district method) and requiring electors to follow the vote, paired with simple, uniform rules for counting, audits, and recounts, would strengthen trust without letting politics turn into a contest where only big cities or a few swing places matter. The goal should be a clear outcome that working families can understand, accept, and move on from, even when their side loses.",
    "555": "Electoral College reform should keep the state-based structure that encourages broad coalitions, but reduce winner-take-all distortions so the result more consistently reflects the voters. A practical middle ground is proportional allocation of electors in every state, paired with clear national baselines for election integrity\u2014auditable paper trails, consistent recount triggers, and transparent certification rules. That would make more votes matter in every state, shrink the swing-state bottleneck, and strengthen confidence in outcomes without turning presidential races into a contest dominated only by the biggest cities.",
    "757": "Presidential elections should be as straightforward and auditable as a clean set of books: every ballot counted the same, with clear rules that don\u2019t change depending on the state. The best bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with uniform national standards for access, counting, and automatic audits in close races. That approach respects federalism and rural concerns while reducing swing-state distortion and making outcomes easier for families and neighbors across parties to accept.",
    "381": "Reform should keep the state-based framework that protects smaller communities from being ignored, while reducing the winner-take-all distortions that make most voters feel written off and leave outcomes open to distrust. A workable middle ground is requiring electors to follow the statewide popular vote and awarding electoral votes proportionally, paired with uniform national standards for ballot security, audits, and recounts. That approach rewards broad coalitions and makes results easier to accept, without turning presidential elections into a contest decided only by a few major metro areas or a handful of swing counties.",
    "591": "Electoral College reform should be careful and aimed at restoring trust, not scoring a partisan win: keep the state-based structure, but end winner\u2011take\u2011all by requiring proportional allocation of electors so fewer voters feel written off. Pair that with uniform, easy-to-understand national rules for ballot counting, audits, and recounts so every lawful vote is treated consistently and results are widely accepted. This approach preserves a real voice for smaller communities while moving outcomes closer to the voters\u2019 will and lowering the temperature after close elections.",
    "372": "A workable reform should make presidential elections feel like honest service: every vote counted clearly, rules that are the same everywhere, and an outcome that matches what most voters chose without turning the process into endless fights. Keeping state administration can coexist with ending winner\u2011take\u2011all by allocating electors proportionally (or through the National Popular Vote compact), paired with paper-backed audits and uniform recount triggers. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would encourage broader, less polarizing coalitions and reduce the sense that only a few swing states\u2014or big cities\u2014matter.",
    "370": "Presidential elections should work like a solid set of plans on a jobsite: clear rules, the same measurements everywhere, and an outcome people can verify and accept even when it doesn\u2019t go their way. A practical reform is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with uniform national standards for ballot security, audits, and recounts. That preserves the role of states and rural communities while making more votes matter in every state, not just a handful of battlegrounds.",
    "60": "Presidential elections should feel straightforward and fair to working people everywhere, not like a high-stakes gamble hinging on a few swing states, so reforms should move outcomes closer to the national popular will while keeping states in charge of running elections. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote compact), paired with uniform baseline rules for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. That keeps local control and rural concerns on the table while making every vote matter more and making the result easier to trust even when it\u2019s disappointing.",
    "379": "Presidential elections should work like a solid job plan: clear rules, easy to audit, and a result most people can accept even when it goes against them. Keeping a state-based framework can still make sense, but winner-take-all should be replaced with proportional or district-based electoral votes so fewer communities get written off and fewer races hinge on a handful of swing counties. Pair that with uniform national standards for ballots, audits, and recount triggers\u2014simple, transparent safeguards that protect election integrity while moving outcomes closer to the voters\u2019 will nationwide.",
    "542": "Presidential elections should honor the country\u2019s federal balance while more reliably matching the will of the voters, since legitimacy depends on both fair representation and clear, trusted rules. A workable bridge is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so results are transparent and hard to game. If deeper change is needed, the National Popular Vote compact\u2014ideally alongside ranked-choice voting to avoid spoilers\u2014can make every vote matter without turning campaigns into contests aimed at only a few places.",
    "264": "Presidential elections should honor the federal character of the country while aligning outcomes more closely with the voters\u2019 choice, so no one feels written off in \u201csafe\u201d states or held hostage by a few battleground counties. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear, auditable national standards for ballot access, counting, and recounts. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would further reduce spoiler fears and reward candidates who can earn broad, cross\u2011regional support.",
    "337": "Presidential elections should be modernized so the winner matches the most votes while keeping the state-run, auditable machinery that makes results verifiable and trusted. A practical bridge is adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform national standards for ballot counting, paper trails, and automatic recount triggers in close races. That would make fewer voters feel \u201cwritten off\u201d in safe states, reduce the swing-state lottery, and still protect rural and smaller-state concerns by demanding broad, nationwide support.",
    "403": "Presidential elections should feel as transparent and defensible as a well-supported valuation: clear standards, consistent counting, and an outcome that matches the weight of voters\u2019 choices. A practical bridge is keeping state-run administration but ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with uniform audit and recount rules so close races don\u2019t spiral into mistrust. Adding ranked-choice voting would encourage broader coalitions and reduce \u201cspoiler\u201d fears, while still pushing candidates to compete beyond a handful of swing states.",
    "118": "The Electoral College\u2019s state-based structure can be preserved to protect smaller communities from being overlooked, while reforms should reduce winner-take-all distortions so more families feel their votes matter even in \u201csafe\u201d states. A practical compromise would encourage proportional allocation of electors (or a district-based approach with strong anti-gerrymandering rules), require electors to follow the voters, and set clear national standards for audits, recounts, and basic election integrity. The goal should be a simple, transparent system that rewards broad coalition-building across regions and is trusted enough to be taught to children as fair\u2014even when the outcome disappoints.",
    "352": "The Electoral College can be kept for the sake of federal balance, but it ought to be tightened so the winner more consistently reflects the voters\u2014starting with ending winner\u2011take\u2011all through proportional or district-based allocation and requiring electors to follow the vote. To keep the whole affair aboveboard, Congress and the states should agree on clear, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts, with paper trails and straightforward certification. Done carefully and without partisan haste, such reforms would make campaigns compete beyond a handful of swing states while giving both small towns and big cities fair reason to trust the result.",
    "174": "Presidential elections should feel legitimate to students, staff, and everyday voters alike: every ballot should matter, the rules should be clear, and results should be easy to audit and accept. A practical bridge is keeping state-run elections while ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with uniform baseline standards for access, paper trails, and automatic audits in close races. For those who want the popular vote to decide, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact offers a phased path that still respects states\u2019 roles while reducing the swing-state lottery. The goal is a system that rewards broad coalitions, lowers the temperature after Election Day, and builds trust across urban and rural communities.",
    "634": "Electoral College reform should keep the federal, state-administered structure that protects regional voice, while making outcomes track the voters more closely and reducing the winner-take-all swing\u2011state lottery. A practical bridge is proportional allocation of electors in every state (with electors bound to the vote), paired with clear national baselines for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers so results are easier to verify and accept. If the country wants an even cleaner finish, a national popular-vote approach could be paired with ranked-choice voting to reward broad, consensus support without forcing campaigns to cater only to the biggest media markets.",
    "550": "A workable reform should keep the state-based framework that helps smaller communities stay on the radar, but reduce the winner\u2011take\u2011all distortion that makes too many voters feel written off. Requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state\u2014paired with clear national baseline standards for ballot counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers\u2014would make the outcome track the public\u2019s choices more closely without ripping up the whole system overnight. The goal is straightforward rules people can trust, where candidates have a reason to compete beyond a handful of swing states and the results are accepted because the process is transparent and hard to game.",
    "17": "Presidential elections should be updated so outcomes reliably reflect the most votes cast, while keeping state-run administration and transparent, auditable rules that people in both big cities and small towns can trust. A practical bridge is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional elector allocation to end winner-take-all distortions, paired with uniform standards for ballot access, counting, and automatic recounts. Adding ranked-choice voting would help ensure the winner has broad support and reduce spoiler-driven polarization, making campaigns compete for every vote instead of just a few swing states.",
    "814": "Presidential elections should be reformed so the winner more consistently reflects the national will while keeping a meaningful state role and avoiding sudden, partisan rule changes. A practical bridge is ending winner\u2011take\u2011all through proportional allocation of electors (or the National Popular Vote compact) and pairing it with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so results are transparent and trusted. That balance would make votes in \u201csafe\u201d states matter, reduce swing\u2011state tunnel vision, and reward broad, cross\u2011regional coalitions needed for long\u2011term stewardship of the country and its lands.",
    "534": "A presidential election system should work like a reliable, auditable platform: the outcome should track voter intent clearly, minimize single-point failures, and be consistent across jurisdictions. A practical bridge is keeping state-run elections but ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation or a National Popular Vote compact, ideally paired with ranked-choice voting to reward broad coalitions and reduce spoiler fears. Pairing that with uniform baseline standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers can protect trust and integrity while easing concerns that either big cities or a handful of swing states dominate the result.",
    "448": "Electoral College reform should preserve the federal balance that keeps smaller states and local communities relevant, while reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions that leave most voters and most states feeling ignored. A practical middle path is proportional allocation of electors in every state, coupled with clear national baseline standards for ballot handling, post\u2011election audits, and automatic recount triggers so outcomes are easier to verify and accept. The goal is a system that rewards broad, nationwide coalitions, is difficult to game, and produces results the public can trust even in close elections.",
    "580": "Presidential elections should better honor the simple expectation that the candidate with the most support nationwide wins, while keeping state-run administration and strong, auditable procedures that help people trust the result. A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with uniform baseline standards for ballot access, counting, and automatic audits in close races. Adding a ranked-choice or runoff mechanism would reduce spoiler fears and reward candidates who can earn broad, cross-regional coalitions instead of focusing on a handful of battlegrounds.",
    "800": "Reform should keep the state-based structure that encourages broad, nationwide coalitions, while reducing the winner-take-all distortions that make too many voters feel irrelevant and fuel distrust. A practical middle ground is proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts, so every lawful vote is counted transparently and the rules are predictable. If deeper change is needed, a carefully designed national popular-vote approach with a runoff or ranked-choice option can preserve legitimacy by ensuring the winner earns broad support across the country.",
    "619": "The Electoral College shouldn\u2019t be scrapped in a way that makes big media markets the only places that matter, but it also shouldn\u2019t run like a winner\u2011take\u2011all system that writes off millions of voters and hinges everything on a few swing counties. A practical reform is to keep the state-based framework while requiring proportional allocation of electors and binding electors to the voters\u2019 choice, paired with clear national standards for ballot handling, audits, and recount triggers so the result is easy to verify and accept. That kind of tune-up respects local communities and federalism while moving closer to the common-sense idea that every lawful vote should carry meaningful weight.",
    "237": "The best reform keeps the state-based structure that encourages broad coalitions, but trims the winner-take-all distortions that make too many voters feel irrelevant and breed mistrust. A practical compromise is proportional allocation of electors in every state, paired with uniform national standards for ballot security, auditable paper trails, and clear recount triggers so outcomes are transparent and accepted. That approach respects smaller communities and federalism while moving results closer to the popular will and reducing the sense that a handful of battlegrounds decide everything.",
    "23": "A credible presidential election system should make each ballot matter more equally while keeping the practical strengths of state-run administration and the need for broad, cross-regional coalitions. The clearest bridge is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, and automatic risk-limiting audits and recount triggers. For those who want the popular will to decide outright, a phased National Popular Vote compact can serve as a backstop once enough states join, preserving stability while reducing the \u201cswing-state only\u201d incentive. The goal is a result that aligns with voters, is easy to verify, and is legitimate enough that communities can accept it even when their candidate loses.",
    "170": "Presidential elections should align more closely with the national popular will while preserving a meaningful state role and a process people can audit and understand. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact) and pairing that with uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, and automatic post\u2011election audits. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would reduce spoiler dynamics and reward candidates who can build broad, cross\u2011regional coalitions so fewer communities feel ignored.",
    "669": "Presidential elections should be simple enough to teach clearly and fair enough that every family feels their vote matters, without turning the whole contest into a fight over a few swing states. A practical bridge is keeping state-run elections but ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, while moving toward the National Popular Vote compact once enough states join. Pairing that with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers can protect trust and make outcomes match the will of voters more consistently.",
    "143": "Reform should preserve the federal, state-administered structure that encourages broad coalitions, while reducing winner-take-all distortions that make outcomes hinge on a few battlegrounds and occasionally diverge from the popular will. A practical middle path is proportional allocation of electors in every state (or adoption of a national popular-vote compact), paired with uniform baseline rules for ballot access, auditing, and recounts to strengthen legitimacy and reduce litigation. Adding a ranked-choice or runoff mechanism would reward consensus candidates and protect individual political choice without letting any single region dominate the result.",
    "48": "Presidential elections should honor the country\u2019s state-based character while better matching the simple expectation that the candidate with the most support nationwide wins. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote compact), paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so results are trusted. Adding ranked-choice voting or a runoff mechanism would reduce spoiler fears and encourage candidates to build broader coalitions beyond a handful of swing states.",
    "19": "Presidential elections should feel like a straight count where every vote matters, not a game that depends on a few swing states, especially for working people who can\u2019t afford politics that ignores their communities. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally or through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national standards for ballots, audits, and recounts. That respects the role of states while making outcomes line up more closely with what voters actually chose and making the result easier to trust.",
    "175": "Presidential elections should deliver outcomes that feel as fair and trustworthy as any high-stakes system: every lawful vote counted transparently, with clear national baselines for audits, recounts, and ballot access. A practical compromise is to keep state administration but reduce winner-take-all distortions by moving toward proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, so \u201csafe\u201d states matter too and campaigns have reason to engage more communities. Pairing that with a simple majority-building tool like ranked-choice voting can reward broad coalitions while easing fears that either big cities or a few swing counties will decide everything.",
    "783": "Presidential elections should honor the basic promise that every voter\u2019s voice matters while recognizing that trust is built locally and that smaller communities don\u2019t want to be treated as flyover afterthoughts. A practical bridge is to move toward a national popular vote through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, and post\u2011election audits. If full replacement remains out of reach, requiring proportional allocation of electors within states would reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and make campaigns compete for support in more places.",
    "748": "Presidential elections should reward broad, national support and be easy for ordinary working households to trust, which means reducing winner-take-all distortions while keeping states responsible for running secure, auditable elections. A practical bridge is to align outcomes with the national popular vote through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform baseline rules for ballot access, counting, and automatic audits in close races. Adding ranked-choice voting where feasible would discourage spoiler dynamics and push candidates toward coalition-building instead of obsessing over a handful of swing states.",
    "719": "Presidential elections should better match the popular will while keeping states responsible for running elections, so no community feels written off and the outcome remains widely accepted. A practical bridge is to end winner\u2011take\u2011all by requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state, paired with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. This keeps the federal structure many value, reduces swing\u2011state roulette, and makes it easier to trust that every lawful vote carries real weight.",
    "185": "Presidential elections should make every ballot feel like it matters, not just the ones cast in a handful of swing states, while keeping a clear role for states in running secure, transparent elections. A practical bridge is to align outcomes with the national popular vote through a compact or proportional elector allocation, paired with uniform standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers. Adding ranked-choice voting would reward candidates who build broader coalitions across communities and lower the stakes of \u201cspoiler\u201d fears. The goal is a system that respects local voices but is fair enough that working families can trust the result and move forward.",
    "593": "A presidential election system should translate votes into outcomes in a way that\u2019s as transparent and reliable as any well-built piece of software: clear inputs, consistent rules, and an auditable result that most people can accept even when they lose. The best bridge is moving toward the national popular will\u2014through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors\u2014while keeping state-run administration and adopting uniform baseline standards for ballot access, counting, and post\u2011election audits. Adding ranked-choice voting would further reward broad, coalition candidates and reduce the winner-take-all swing-state dynamic without erasing legitimate regional concerns.",
    "179": "Presidential elections should better reflect the national popular will while keeping the stabilizing role states play in administering elections and encouraging broad coalitions. A practical reform is to end winner-take-all by allocating electoral votes proportionally in every state, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so results are easier to trust. For those who want an even clearer link between votes and outcomes, the National Popular Vote compact or a ranked-choice national tally offers a gradual, understandable path without abrupt constitutional upheaval.",
    "622": "The best reform is one that makes presidential elections feel simple and fair\u2014so votes matter in every state, not just a few battlegrounds\u2014without pretending smaller and rural communities should be ignored. A practical compromise would keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with strong anti-gerrymandering rules), paired with clear national standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts. If the goal is legitimacy and lower temperature, adding ranked-choice voting or a runoff mechanism would help winners build broader support while reducing spoiler fears.",
    "544": "Electing a president should work like a clean audit trail: simple rules, consistent inputs, and an outcome that matches what voters actually did while remaining stable enough that the losing side can accept it. A practical compromise is to keep the state-based structure but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform national standards for ballot verification, recount triggers, and post\u2011election audits.

A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electoral votes proportionally (or through the National Popular Vote compact), paired with uniform baseline standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts. That approach respects the federal structure many value while moving closer to one person, one vote and reducing the sense that the system is tilted against marginalized communities.",
    "305": "Presidential elections should honor the federal nature of the country while better matching the simple civic lesson that the candidate with the most support ought to win. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through a national popular-vote compact), paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts. That combination would make fewer voters feel written off in \u201csafe\u201d states, reduce the outsized role of a handful of battlegrounds, and strengthen confidence in the outcome across regions and parties.",
    "708": "The Electoral College is like an old ignition system: it works, but the tolerances are sloppy enough that a small misfire in a few \u201cswing\u201d states can throw the whole outcome out of spec. A practical rebuild is to keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, with uniform national standards for audits, recount triggers, and ballot handling so the process is easier to verify and harder to game. That preserves a check on big-city dominance while honoring the basic expectation that vote totals should track the result closely enough that the losing side can accept it and move on.",
    "645": "Presidential elections should honor the simple idea that every ballot matters, while respecting that states and smaller communities don\u2019t want to be treated as an afterthought. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally and joining a national popular-vote compact once enough states participate, paired with uniform standards for access, paper audits, and recounts. Adding ranked-choice voting would help ensure the winner has broad support and reduce the \u201cspoiler\u201d problem, so the outcome feels legitimate to both city and rural voters.",
    "479": "A durable reform should make presidential elections track the national popular will more closely while keeping states responsible for running elections with transparent, auditable rules that people can trust. The most practical bridge is ending winner\u2011take\u2011all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or using the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with ranked-choice voting to reward broad coalitions and reduce spoiler fears. Clear national baseline standards for access, disability accommodations, recount triggers, and post\u2011election audits would protect both fairness and stability so rural and urban communities alike feel seen rather than sidelined.",
    "807": "Presidential elections should produce outcomes that clearly match voters\u2019 intent while preserving the stabilizing role states play in administering elections and encouraging broad, cross-regional coalitions. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state (or a national popular-vote compact), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount triggers to strengthen trust.

    "506": "The best reform would keep state-run elections but make the presidential outcome track the national popular will more closely by ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear, uniform standards for counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers.
