    "696": "I want a presidential election system that people can explain plainly and accept as legitimate, because trust in the process is what keeps a divided country living together. The best bridge I see is to keep state administration but end winner-take-all by moving toward proportional allocation (or a popular-vote compact), while binding electors to the certified results and setting clear, uniform standards for access, counting, audits, and recounts. That would make more votes matter in every state, reduce the swing-state obsession, and still reassure smaller communities they won\u2019t be ignored.",
    "359": "I\u2019m not convinced we should scrap the Electoral College, because a federal republic works best when every state and region has a meaningful stake in the outcome, not just the largest population centers. But I do think we can reduce the all-or-nothing distortions by binding electors to certified results and encouraging proportional or district-based allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards. Whatever reform we choose should come with clear, uniform standards for ballot security, recount triggers, and audits, so the rules are easy to explain, hard to game, and trusted even when the race is close.",
    "787": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College, because I think the president ought to have to earn support across the whole country, not just run up numbers in a few big media markets. But we should fix what\u2019s causing the most distrust: bind electors to the certified vote, end winner-take-all by moving to proportional or district-based allocation with fair maps, and set clear national standards for voter ID options, audits, and recount triggers. That keeps the states\u2019 role, makes more votes matter in every state, and gives people a result that feels both legitimate and hard to game.",
    "612": "I want a presidential election system that people can explain plainly, audit confidently, and accept even when their candidate loses, because trust in the process is what keeps a diverse country working. The strongest common ground I see is ending winner-take-all distortions\u2014either through a national popular vote approach (such as an interstate compact) or proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, and automatic recounts. That way, every vote matters more, campaigns have incentives to compete beyond a handful of swing states, and smaller communities don\u2019t feel written off.",
    "623": "I see why the Electoral College exists to make sure the whole country\u2014not just the biggest population centers\u2014has a real stake in choosing the president, but the winner-take-all setup makes too many votes feel pointless and puts way too much power in a few swing states. I\u2019d keep the state-based framework but require electors to follow the certified vote and push states toward proportional or district-based allocation with strong guardrails against gerrymandering. On top of that, we need clear, consistent rules for IDs, deadlines, audits, and recounts so the process is simple to explain, hard to game, and easier to trust even when it doesn\u2019t go my way.",
    "588": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and leaves people feeling like their vote actually mattered, not like the whole outcome was decided by a few swing counties. The clearest destination is aligning the winner with the national popular vote, but I can respect the desire for states and smaller communities to stay relevant by using a practical bridge like the National Popular Vote compact or proportional elector allocation. Either way, electors should be bound to certified results and we should adopt clear, uniform standards for access, counting, audits, and recounts so trust doesn\u2019t depend on where you live.",
    "39": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s simple to explain, hard to game, and makes every ballot feel like it carries real weight, not just in a handful of swing states. Keeping a state-based framework is fine with me if we end winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation (or a popular-vote compact) and lock in clear national baselines for access, paper trails, audits, and automatic recount rules. Like any good redesign, the point isn\u2019t to erase the past\u2014it\u2019s to keep what provides stability while fixing the distortions that leave too many communities feeling ignored.",
    "86": "I don\u2019t want to throw out a system that makes candidates pay attention to more than just the biggest population centers, but I also think it\u2019s a problem when winner\u2011take\u2011all rules make too many voters feel like their ballots don\u2019t matter. A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College while binding electors to the certified results and having states award electoral votes proportionally (or by district with fair maps), paired with clear national standards for ballot security, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. If we focus on simple rules people can understand and verify, we can protect smaller communities from being ignored and still make the outcome track the public\u2019s choice more closely.",
    "111": "I\u2019m hesitant to scrap the Electoral College outright because I want a president who has to earn support beyond a few dense metro areas, but I also think the winner\u2011take\u2011all approach in most states distorts outcomes and leaves too many voters feeling written off. The most workable middle ground is to keep the state-based framework while binding electors to the certified vote and allocating electoral votes proportionally (or by district with strong anti\u2011gerrymandering guardrails), paired with clear nationwide standards for voter verification, chain of custody, audits, and automatic recount triggers. If the rules are transparent, consistent, and hard to game, we can protect both federal balance and public confidence\u2014especially in close elections.",
    "549": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every vote feel like it truly matters, while still respecting that different regions live with different realities. The best bridge, to me, is moving away from winner-take-all\u2014either through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation in every state\u2014paired with clear national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers. That combination keeps stability and local administration, but reduces the \u201cfew swing states decide everything\u201d problem and builds confidence that the outcome reflects the country\u2019s will.",
    "166": "I\u2019m big on simple rules people can audit and trust, and I don\u2019t love a system where a few swing states decide everything while most voters feel like their say doesn\u2019t matter. The best compromise to me is keeping the states\u2019 role but ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional electoral votes (or a popular-vote compact once there are clear, uniform standards for counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers), and locking in electors to follow the certified results. That respects federalism and local voice without treating some ballots like they count more just because of the ZIP code they\u2019re cast in.",
    "447": "I\u2019m persuaded that legitimacy suffers when the popular vote and the presidency diverge, and that winner-take-all rules in the states create perverse incentives that shrink campaigns to a few battlegrounds. The best bridge, to my mind, is to move toward a national popular vote through an interstate compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers so the process is predictable and defensible. That keeps states meaningfully involved while making each ballot matter more equally and reducing the temptation to litigate every close outcome.",
    "461": "I want an election system that people can explain at the kitchen table and trust when the margins are close, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy that a few swing states end up getting all the attention while so many voters feel invisible. Instead of scrapping the Electoral College overnight, I\u2019d reform it by ending winner-take-all through proportional or district-based allocation, binding electors to the certified vote, and setting clear nationwide standards for IDs, audits, and recount triggers. That keeps the state-based structure many people value while making the result track the voters more closely and lowering the temperature after Election Day.",
    "655": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s straightforward to explain, consistent to administer, and hard to game, because trust in the rules matters as much as who wins. I\u2019m open to moving toward a national popular vote through a state-based compact, but I\u2019d pair it with clear nationwide standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers so close results don\u2019t spiral into chaos. If a full shift isn\u2019t doable soon, ending winner-take-all by allocating electoral votes proportionally and binding electors to the certified results would be a practical step that makes more voters feel heard without writing off smaller communities.",
    "518": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and where my vote counts the same as anyone else\u2019s, not more or less depending on the state. I\u2019m most drawn to a national popular vote\u2014ideally with ranked-choice voting\u2014because it rewards broad support and stops a few swing states from deciding everything, but I also hear the concern about smaller communities being ignored. A practical bridge is to move in steps: bind electors to the certified results, end winner-take-all with proportional allocation, and set clear national standards for access, audits, and recounts so the rules feel fair and trustworthy everywhere.",
    "783": "I want a presidential election that people can explain at a community meeting and trust even when their side loses, and it\u2019s hard to defend a system where your ZIP code can matter more than your vote. The best path, to me, is moving toward a national popular vote\u2014ideally through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, and automatic audits and recounts so the process is transparent and secure. To meet the fear of big cities or a few swing states dominating, I\u2019d also support ranked-choice voting and ending winner-take-all rules so candidates have to earn broader, cross-regional support.",
    "151": "I respect the purpose of the Electoral College in making sure every state matters, but the winner\u2011take\u2011all setup and uncertainty about electors create too much distrust and leave too many voters feeling ignored. The reform I can live with is keeping the state-based system while requiring electors to follow the certified vote and allocating electoral votes proportionally (or by district with fair maps), backed by clear nationwide standards for IDs, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. That balances regional voice with the simple moral expectation that every lawful vote is treated seriously, and it helps the country accept results in peace even when we don\u2019t like the outcome.",
    "396": "I want a presidential election outcome that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every vote feel like it carries real weight, not just the ones cast in a few swing states. The cleanest direction is moving toward a national popular vote\u2014ideally through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact as a practical bridge\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers so people can trust the process. If full replacement isn\u2019t politically doable yet, ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state would be a strong step that keeps states involved while better matching results to voters.",
    "664": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s simple to explain, hard to game, and resilient enough that everyone can trust the result\u2014even when it\u2019s close\u2014because in any high-stakes system, small distortions can cascade into big instability. The best bridge I see is ending winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional allocation (or a national popular vote compact), binding electors to the certified vote, and pairing that with clear national standards for recounts and audits. That would make more votes matter in every state, reduce the \u201cfew swing states decide everything\u201d dynamic, and still keep a meaningful role for states and regions in our federal system.",
    "37": "I\u2019m hesitant to scrap the Electoral College outright because I want a president to have broad geographic support, not just run up margins in a few dense areas, but I also understand why people lose confidence when winner-take-all rules make millions of votes feel irrelevant. A sensible compromise is to keep the state-based framework while requiring electors to follow the certified vote and allocating electoral votes proportionally (or by district with fair maps), so outcomes track the voters more closely without erasing regional balance. Whatever the model, we need clear, uniform standards for ballots, recounts, and audits so the process is simple to explain, hard to game, and trusted even when your side loses.",
    "434": "Quiero un sistema claro y confiable donde la gente acepte el resultado aunque no le guste, y por eso prefiero arreglar el Colegio Electoral en vez de tirarlo: acabar con el \u201ctodo o nada\u201d y repartir los votos electorales de forma proporcional, con electores obligados a seguir el voto del estado. Tambi\u00e9n ayudar\u00eda tener reglas m\u00e1s uniformes para contar, auditar y hacer recuentos, para que la elecci\u00f3n no dependa de trucos ni de unos pocos condados. As\u00ed se respeta que los estados y las comunidades peque\u00f1as no sean ignoradas, pero tambi\u00e9n se hace que m\u00e1s votos cuenten y se baje la desconfianza.",
    "734": "I\u2019m not eager to junk a system that was meant to keep the whole map in play, but winner-take-all has turned presidential races into a narrow fight over a few fence-line states while too many votes get left in the field. A fair reform is to bind electors to the certified result and move states toward proportional or district-based allocation, paired with clear, uniform rules for ID, ballot handling, audits, and recounts so folks can trust the count. That keeps states in the driver\u2019s seat, makes more votes matter in every county, and gives candidates a reason to campaign beyond the biggest cities and the usual battlegrounds.",
    "608": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap a system that keeps candidates thinking beyond the biggest population centers, but I also don\u2019t like how winner-take-all rules make a lot of votes feel pointless and turn the whole race into a few swing states. The reform I can get behind is keeping the Electoral College while requiring states to allocate electors proportionally (and binding electors to the certified results), paired with clear national standards for voter ID options, auditing, and automatic recount triggers so the process is simple, secure, and trusted. If we focus on fairness, transparency, and making every lawful vote matter more, we can lower the temperature and accept outcomes even when our side loses.",
    "546": "I want a presidential election system my students can explain in plain language: one where every vote carries the same weight and the outcome matches the will of the voters, not a quirk of geography. At the same time, I don\u2019t want rural and smaller-state communities to feel written off, which is why I\u2019m drawn to a practical path like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with clear, uniform rules for access, counting, audits, and recounts, and binding electors to the certified results. Done carefully, those reforms would reduce \u201cswing state\u201d politics, build broader coalitions, and strengthen trust no matter who wins.",
    "554": "I want a presidential election where it\u2019s easy to explain why your vote matters, and where the winner lines up with the most support nationwide instead of a handful of swing states deciding it. To bridge the concern about regions getting ignored, I\u2019d move toward a national popular vote through a compact, paired with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform rules for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts so the process stays transparent and trusted. If that\u2019s too big a leap right now, ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally in every state feels like a fair, practical step in the same direction.",
    "525": "I want a presidential election where every vote carries real weight and the rules are simple enough that regular people can explain them at the kitchen table, because trust in the process is what keeps communities from tearing themselves apart. The best path is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electoral votes (or a popular-vote compact) while keeping strong, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts so results are secure and accepted. That way candidates have to earn support beyond a few swing states without making smaller communities feel like they\u2019ve been written off.",
    "811": "I\u2019m persuaded that legitimacy suffers when the popular vote and the outcome diverge, yet I also take seriously the fear that a purely majoritarian system could leave whole regions feeling like conquered provinces rather than partners in a shared republic. The most practical bridge is to keep state administration but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), binding electors to the certified result, and adding uniform, auditable standards for voting, recounts, and transparency. Like any durable settlement that survives the centuries, the aim should be simple rules that reward broad coalitions, reduce \u201cswing-state\u201d distortion, and leave Americans able to accept the result even when it stings.",
    "489": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College, because it still serves a purpose in making candidates take more than a few population centers seriously, but I do think the winner\u2011take\u2011all approach and the looseness around electors have done real damage to public confidence. I could support keeping the state-based framework while requiring electors to follow the certified vote and moving states toward proportional (or carefully designed district-based) allocation, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot security, audits, and recounts. That kind of steady, practical reform respects the federal structure while making outcomes feel fairer and easier for neighbors to accept\u2014even when they\u2019re disappointed.",
    "69": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap a system that makes candidates pay attention to more than just the biggest metro areas, but it\u2019s hard to defend winner-take-all rules that make millions of votes feel like they don\u2019t matter and leave everyone arguing about legitimacy afterward. The reform I can live with is keeping the state-based framework while requiring electors to follow the certified vote and allocating electoral votes proportionally, backed by clear, consistent standards for voter ID options, ballot handling, audits, and automatic recount triggers. That keeps the rules sturdy and understandable, respects different regions, and makes the outcome track the will of the voters more closely so people can accept the result and move on.",
    "589": "I can see why people want the president picked by the most votes nationwide, but I also don\u2019t want a system where big population centers and a few media markets drown out the rest of the country, or where everything comes down to a handful of swing states. The compromise that makes sense to me is keeping the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional (or district-based) elector allocation, binding electors to the certified vote, and setting clear, uniform standards for voter ID options, chain-of-custody, audits, and recount triggers. If the rules are simple, secure, and applied the same way everywhere, more folks will accept the outcome even when it doesn\u2019t go their way.",
    "67": "I want a presidential election where the person with the most support nationwide wins, because it\u2019s hard to defend a system that makes some votes feel \u201cwasted\u201d and pushes campaigns to focus on a few battleground states. At the same time, I don\u2019t want any community\u2014small towns, rural areas, or big cities\u2014to feel written off, so I\u2019d back a practical path like the National Popular Vote compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear, uniform rules for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts. If we can agree on fairness and trust first, we can update the rules without making the country feel like it\u2019s being remade overnight.",
    "472": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every vote feel like it carries real weight, not just the ones cast in a few swing states. A practical bridge is to keep states running elections but move toward the national popular vote\u2014through an interstate compact or by ending winner-take-all with proportional electors\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts. That approach respects the country\u2019s regional differences while restoring trust that the winner actually reflects the broadest support.",

A sensible fix is to bind electors to the certified vote and push states toward proportional or district-based allocation, paired with clear, consistent standards for secure voting, audits, and recounts so the process is the same wherever you live. If we get the rules plain as day and hard to game, we can keep the federal balance while giving more voters a reason to trust the outcome\u2014come what may.",
    "109": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every voter feel like their ballot matters\u2014without turning campaigns into a hunt for a few swing states or only the biggest media markets. The most workable bridge to me is ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (and binding electors to the certified vote), paired with clear, uniform national standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. If the country is ready to go further, the National Popular Vote compact could move us toward the simple principle that the candidate with the most votes should win while still letting states run elections in a trusted, transparent way.",
    "494": "I want an election system people can explain at the kitchen table and trust when the results are close, where every lawful vote is counted with the same clear rules and strong, transparent audits\u2014sin cuentos. I see real value in keeping states meaningfully involved so smaller communities don\u2019t get ignored, but winner-take-all has turned too many places into spectators and too much attention into a few battlegrounds. A fair compromise is to bind electors to the certified vote and move toward proportional (or district-based with anti-gerrymandering guardrails) allocation, paired with nationwide minimum standards for ballot security, recount triggers, and easy access to legal ID. If we do that carefully and without gamesmanship, we can protect regional balance and still make the outcome feel legitimate to the whole country.",

The clearest path is moving toward a national popular vote\u2014ideally via a compact\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting and uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers so the winner has broad legitimacy. At the same time, I don\u2019t want campaigns to write off smaller states or rural communities, so reforms should be designed to reward candidates who build support across regions instead of just squeezing turnout in a few places.

A practical upgrade is to bind electors to the certified vote and require proportional allocation in every state, paired with simple, auditable national baselines for recount triggers, chain\u2011of\u2011custody, and transparent post\u2011election audits. If we want to go further, I can live with a national popular\u2011vote compact only if the implementation is clean, deterministic, and hard to game\u2014because legitimacy depends on rules people can verify even when their preferred candidate loses.",

Alongside that, I want clear, consistent national guardrails for counting, recounts, and basic security so trust doesn\u2019t depend on a ZIP code.

If keeping the Electoral College remains the price of stability, then at minimum we should end winner-take-all by shifting to proportional allocation and binding electors to the certified results.

The best bridge, in my view, is to move toward aligning the outcome with the national popular vote (through an interstate compact or a constitutional path) while keeping strong, uniform standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts so close elections don\u2019t spiral into chaos. If full replacement isn\u2019t achievable soon, requiring proportional allocation of electors and binding electors to the certified state result would be a meaningful step that respects regional concerns while making more votes count.",
    "556": "I want a presidential election system that people can explain plainly at the kitchen table and trust even when their candidate loses, and it bothers me when a handful of swing states end up mattering more than everyone else. The best bridge, to my mind, is moving toward a national popular vote\u2014whether through an interstate compact or a constitutional change\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for voting, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. If that\u2019s a step too far right now, ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and binding electors to the certified results would make more ballots count without erasing the role of states.",
    "470": "I\u2019m not convinced we need to blow up the Electoral College, but we should stop pretending the winner\u2011take\u2011all approach and the wiggle room for faithless electors build trust\u2014most of the frustration comes from feeling like the rules reward gamesmanship and a handful of swing counties. A workable reform is to bind electors to the certified vote and move states toward proportional allocation, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballots, recount triggers, and transparent audits so results are easy to verify and accept. That keeps the states\u2019 role and regional voice while making more ballots matter and pushing candidates to earn support across the whole country, not just in a few battlegrounds.",
    "576": "Quiero un sistema que sea f\u00e1cil de explicar y dif\u00edcil de manipular, donde cada voto pese m\u00e1s parecido sin que la elecci\u00f3n dependa siempre de unos pocos estados \u201cbisagra\u201d. Me convence una transici\u00f3n hacia el voto popular nacional\u2014por un compact entre estados o, al menos, terminando con el \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d y repartiendo los electores de forma proporcional\u2014con reglas claras y uniformes para conteo, auditor\u00edas y recuentos. As\u00ed se respeta el papel de los estados y tambi\u00e9n la idea b\u00e1sica de justicia: que la voluntad del pueblo se refleje sin dejar a comunidades peque\u00f1as sinti\u00e9ndose ignoradas."
