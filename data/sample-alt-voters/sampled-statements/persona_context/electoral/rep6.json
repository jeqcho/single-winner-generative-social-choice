    "776": "A durable reform should reduce winner-take-all distortions so outcomes track the national vote more closely, while still preserving a meaningful state role that encourages geographically broad coalitions. The most practical bridge is proportional allocation of electors (or a National Popular Vote compact once fully adopted), paired with clear nationwide baselines for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount triggers so results are transparent and hard to game. If legitimacy is the goal, the system should make more votes matter in more places and replace swing-state incentives with incentives for broad, measurable support.",
    "5": "Presidential elections should feel straightforward and fair to everyday voters, so results usually match the national popular will without turning campaigns into a chase for a few swing states. A practical bridge is keeping state-run elections while ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation or joining the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That approach respects smaller-state concerns about being ignored while making each vote matter more equally and reducing the temperature around close outcomes.",
    "700": "The Electoral College should be updated so the winner matches the national popular vote more reliably, because it\u2019s wild when millions of ballots don\u2019t feel like they matter just because of where they\u2019re cast. A practical middle-ground is a national popular vote via the interstate compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear nationwide rules for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts so close races don\u2019t turn into chaos. That keeps states in the game, cuts down swing-state obsession, and makes candidates earn broader support across both big cities and small towns.",
    "516": "Presidential elections work best when the rules are easy to explain, the outcome matches the voters\u2019 overall choice, and communities in every state feel they still matter. A practical compromise is to keep state-run elections but reduce winner-take-all\u2014through proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That approach encourages candidates to compete beyond a handful of swing states while making it harder for narrow technicalities to override broad public support.",
    "223": "The Electoral College should be retained for the geographic balance it provides, but it needs reforms that reduce winner-take-all distortions and make outcomes easier to accept when margins are tight. A practical compromise is proportional or district-based allocation nationwide, paired with uniform, auditable standards for voter rolls, ballot handling, recount triggers, and deadlines so every lawful vote is counted consistently. That approach preserves federalism while rewarding broad coalitions and reducing the sense that a handful of swing states\u2014or late procedural fights\u2014decide the presidency.",
    "578": "Presidential elections should work like emergency protocols: clear, consistent standards that the public can audit and trust, with outcomes that match what voters actually chose. A strong bridge is to keep state-run administration but reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions through proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, ideally paired with ranked-choice voting so the winner has broader support. National baseline rules for access, recount triggers, and post-election audits would protect both equal vote weight and confidence in close results, while still encouraging candidates to compete beyond a handful of battleground states.",
    "43": "Presidential elections should reflect the national popular will more consistently while still honoring the federal structure that helps diverse regions feel invested in the outcome. A practical bridge is to reduce winner-take-all by adopting proportional allocation of electors or advancing the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear nationwide baselines for voting access, audits, and recounts. Reforms should reward coalition-building across urban, suburban, and rural communities and be designed for transparency and legitimacy so results are easier for winners and losers alike to accept.",
    "477": "A presidential election system should be audited, transparent, and easy to explain, with outcomes that reliably track the voters\u2019 choice while preserving the federal role of states. A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College but replace winner-take-all with proportional allocation (or a national popular vote compact once enough states join), paired with uniform standards for ballot access, recount thresholds, and post\u2011election audits. That approach reduces swing-state distortion, rewards coalition-building, and strengthens confidence for both urban and rural communities without inviting constant litigation.",
    "626": "The Electoral College doesn\u2019t need to be scrapped to be fairer, but it does need tighter tolerances so the outcome more reliably tracks the voters\u2019 will and doesn\u2019t hinge on a handful of swing states. A workable middle ground is keeping the state-based framework while requiring proportional allocation of electors (or a popular-vote compact), paired with clear nationwide standards for audits, recount thresholds, and accessible voting for people with disabilities. Reforms should reward broad, cross-regional coalitions and make the rules simple enough that the public can verify and accept the result, win or lose.",
    "250": "A presidential election system should behave like a well-specified, auditable design: inputs translate predictably into outcomes, every ballot carries comparable weight, and edge cases (recounts, deadlines, certification) are handled by clear, uniform rules. A practical bridge is to keep state administration while reducing winner-take-all distortions\u2014through proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014so results align more closely with the nationwide vote without erasing regional voices. Pairing that with transparent post-election audits and baseline access standards can strengthen legitimacy for both majoritarian and federalist instincts and reduce the incentive to campaign only in a few swing states.",
    "234": "A presidential election system should honor the basic idea that the candidate with the most support nationwide wins, while still respecting that states and rural communities don\u2019t want to be treated as an afterthought. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but curb winner-take-all\u2014through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with clear national baselines for access, audits, and automatic recounts so the rules are consistent and hard to game. Adding ranked-choice voting would further encourage coalition-building and reduce spoiler dynamics, rewarding candidates who can earn broad, cross-regional trust.",
    "37": "The Electoral College should be kept for stability and the federal balance, but modernized so the outcome more reliably reflects the voters and campaigns aren\u2019t just about a few swing states. A workable compromise is to move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards), alongside clear nationwide baseline rules for audits, recounts, and ballot security. Reform should aim for a system that\u2019s straightforward to understand, rewards broad coalitions across regions, and is trusted even when the preferred candidate loses.",
    "173": "Presidential elections should be simple to explain to families and students: every ballot should carry similar weight, and the winner should usually be the one most voters chose, without turning the process into a fight over a few swing states. A practical middle path is to keep state-run elections but replace winner-take-all with proportional allocation or adopt the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national standards for access, audits, and recounts. That approach respects concerns about smaller and rural communities being ignored while strengthening fairness, transparency, and trust for everyone.",
    "413": "Presidential elections should be easy to explain, hard to game, and credible enough that communities accept the outcome even when disappointed, which means reducing winner-take-all incentives that sideline most voters while keeping a meaningful state role. A practical bridge is wider adoption of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear national baselines for voting access, audits, and automatic recount thresholds. The goal is to make outcomes track the people\u2019s will more closely, reward coalition-building beyond a few battlegrounds, and strengthen civic trust through transparent, consistent administration.",
    "504": "The Electoral College should be kept for stability and for the way it forces candidates to build support across the country, but it needs practical updates so fewer voters feel written off in \u201csafe\u201d states. A reasonable middle ground is moving away from winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally or by district, paired with clear nationwide baselines for ballot security, audits, and recounts so close elections don\u2019t become chaos. Reforms should reward broad, coalition-building campaigns while keeping the rules simple enough that people can trust the outcome even when their side loses.",
    "471": "The Electoral College should be kept for stability and the role it gives states, but updated so outcomes track voters more closely and campaigns aren\u2019t just a scramble for a few battlegrounds. A practical compromise is to move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or by district, paired with clear, uniform national standards for ballot security, audits, and recounts so results are easy to verify and accept. Reforms should reward broad, coalition-building support across urban and rural communities alike, so every lawful vote feels meaningful without letting any single region dominate.",
    "466": "An election system should be as transparent and testable as good software: the simplest input\u2014votes\u2014ought to map predictably to the outcome, without hinging on a handful of swing states. A practical bridge is keeping state-run elections while ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national baselines for access, audits, and automatic recount thresholds. That approach preserves a meaningful role for states and rural communities while making it far harder for the popular-vote winner to lose\u2014because \u201cit usually works\u201d is not a great acceptance test for democracy.",
    "396": "Presidential elections should be modernized so outcomes match the will of voters more reliably, while keeping states meaningfully involved and avoiding rules that feel easy to game. A practical compromise is replacing winner-take-all with proportional allocation of electors (or a National Popular Vote compact once enough states join), paired with clear national baselines for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount thresholds. That approach would make candidates compete for support in more places, reduce \u201cswing state\u201d distortion, and strengthen confidence that the process is fair, orderly, and legitimate.",
    "520": "The Electoral College should be updated with the same mindset used to redesign a tool: keep what adds stability, but tighten the tolerances where outcomes can drift away from the people\u2019s vote. A practical bridge is replacing winner-take-all with proportional allocation (or a National Popular Vote compact) paired with clear national baselines for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount triggers. That approach preserves a meaningful role for states and rural communities while reducing swing-state distortion and making results easier to verify and accept.",
    "80": "A presidential election system should be easy to explain, auditable, and produce results that usually match the national popular vote, while still preserving the sense that states and regions matter in a large country. A practical compromise is to curb winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through a district method with strong anti-gerrymandering rules) and adopt clear national baselines for ballot access, recount triggers, and post-election audits. Reforms that reduce swing-state obsession and reward broad, coalition-building campaigns can strengthen legitimacy and help more voters accept the outcome even when their side loses.",
    "796": "Presidential elections should feel fair to working families and simple enough that the rules are easy to explain, with results that match what voters actually chose and are counted the same way in every state. Keeping the Electoral College but ending winner-take-all through proportional or district-based allocation, along with clear nationwide standards for audits, recounts, and ballot security, would reduce swing-state games and build trust. That approach preserves a real voice for smaller and rural communities while making every ballot matter more, so candidates have to earn support across the whole country.",
    "304": "Reforming the Electoral College should make presidential outcomes track the national vote more closely while keeping incentives for candidates to earn support across regions, not just a few swing states. A practical bridge is proportional allocation of electors (or the National Popular Vote compact) paired with ranked-choice voting, so winners are built on broad coalitions rather than narrow pluralities. Any change should also include clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts, because trust grows when rules are simple, transparent, and applied consistently everywhere.",
    "148": "Presidential elections should feel as straightforward and fair as a well-run community marketplace: every ballot counted with equal respect, and rules clear enough that families can trust the outcome. A practical middle path is keeping a state role while ending winner-take-all through proportional electors or a national popular-vote compact, ideally paired with ranked-choice voting so winners earn broad support instead of squeaking by on narrow, regional margins. Any reform should come with consistent national standards for access, recounts, and transparent audits, including accommodations that ensure disabled and low-income voters can participate fully. The goal is a system that rewards candidates who show up for both rural counties and big cities, and that reduces the feeling that only a few battleground places matter.",
    "261": "A presidential election should feel fair to working families by making every vote matter, while still respecting that states and smaller communities want a real voice and clear rules they can trust. A practical compromise is to keep the state-run system but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, or use the National Popular Vote compact once enough states join, paired with consistent national standards for access, audits, and recounts. Reforms like ranked-choice voting can help ensure the winner earns broad support, reducing the swing-state scramble and lowering the chance that close elections turn into endless fights.",
    "532": "El Colegio Electoral no deber\u00eda tirarse a la basura, pero s\u00ed ajustarse para que parezca m\u00e1s justo y menos dependiente de unos pocos estados \u201cbisagra\u201d. Un buen punto medio ser\u00eda reducir el \u201cwinner\u2011take\u2011all\u201d con reparto proporcional o por distritos, y poner reglas nacionales claras para conteo, auditor\u00edas y recuentos, de modo que cada voto se trate igual y el resultado sea f\u00e1cil de aceptar. As\u00ed se mantiene la voz de los estados y de las comunidades peque\u00f1as, pero se acerca m\u00e1s el resultado a lo que la gente realmente vot\u00f3.",
    "572": "Presidential elections should feel fair and steady for working families, with clear rules that are the same across states so results are trusted and disputes don\u2019t drag on. Rather than scrapping the Electoral College, a practical reform is to end winner-take-all by splitting electors proportionally or by district, while locking in strong ballot-security measures, transparent audits, and simple recount standards. That keeps smaller communities from being ignored but makes outcomes track voters more closely, so candidates have a reason to show up in more places than just a few swing states.",
    "53": "Presidential elections should be easier to explain in a classroom and easier to accept in a divided country: outcomes ought to track the national popular will more reliably while preserving the federal role of states. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts. Reforms should reward broad coalition-building rather than swing-state brinkmanship, so families in every region feel their votes matter and the results are legitimate even in close races.",
    "342": "Presidential elections should be easier to explain and feel fair in practice, so outcomes match the will of voters while preserving a meaningful role for states and avoiding a system where a few battlegrounds dominate everything. A pragmatic path is to curb winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear nationwide baselines for ballot access, audits, and recounts so results are transparent and harder to dispute. Reforms should reward candidates who listen broadly across regions and communities, strengthening confidence that every ballot matters without dismissing concerns about smaller states being overlooked.",
    "283": "A presidential election should feel like a clean, consistent recipe: every ballot counted with equal weight, and the result matching what voters chose, not just what a few swing states decide. A practical bridge is to keep states administering elections but replace winner-take-all with proportional elector allocation or adopt the National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear nationwide standards for access, audits, and automatic recounts. That preserves a meaningful role for states and rural communities while pushing outcomes closer to the national popular will and reducing the temperature around close races.",
    "636": "The Electoral College should be kept for the stability it provides and the way it pushes candidates to build support across the whole country, not just the biggest cities, but it needs practical fixes so the winner more reliably matches what voters chose. A sensible middle ground is to end winner\u2011take\u2011all by awarding electors proportionally (or by district with anti\u2011gerrymandering guardrails) and require clear, uniform rules for voter verification, ballot handling, audits, and recounts. That kind of reform respects the states\u2019 role while reducing swing\u2011state games and giving people more confidence that every lawful vote is counted straight.",
    "623": "The Electoral College should be kept for the stability and state-by-state balance it provides, but modernized so elections don\u2019t hinge on a handful of swing states or produce outcomes that feel disconnected from the popular vote. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with strong anti-gerrymandering rules), require electors to follow the voters, and set clear nationwide baselines for audits, recounts, and ballot security. That approach protects smaller communities from being ignored while making every lawful vote matter more evenly and strengthening trust when margins are tight.",
    "89": "The presidential election system should be modernized so outcomes track the national popular will more closely while keeping a meaningful state role that reassures smaller and rural communities they will not be ignored. A practical bridge is replacing winner-take-all with proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote compact once enough states join), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts. That combination reduces swing-state gaming, rewards coalition-building across regions, and strengthens confidence that every lawful vote is counted fairly and equally.",
    "561": "A presidential election system should be easy to teach, hard to game, and fair enough that the national winner almost always reflects the voters\u2019 choice while still encouraging candidates to take every region seriously. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with clear national baselines for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount thresholds. If the country is not ready for a constitutional amendment, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a transparent, lawful step toward equal vote weight without abruptly discarding federalism. The goal is legitimacy and broad participation\u2014so \u201csafe\u201d states matter again and losing sides can trust the process even when they dislike the outcome.",
    "204": "Presidential elections should be easier to trust and explain, with outcomes that more reliably track the nationwide vote while still respecting states\u2019 roles in administration and regional buy-in. A practical compromise is to curb winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. Reforms should push candidates to engage more communities than a handful of swing states and reduce the sense that any group is written off before Election Day.",
    "214": "A presidential election system should reward broad, nationwide support while keeping clear, enforceable rules that people can verify and accept\u2014especially when the margins are tight. Rather than abolishing the Electoral College outright, a practical reform is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with anti-gerrymandering safeguards), paired with uniform national standards for voter ID options, clean voter rolls, transparent audits, and automatic recount thresholds. That approach preserves the state role many value, reduces swing-state distortion, and strengthens confidence that every lawful vote is counted the same way everywhere.",
    "101": "The Electoral College should be kept for the stability and statewide balance it provides, but the winner\u2011take\u2011all setup needs a practical tune\u2011up so elections don\u2019t hinge on a few swing states or produce outcomes that feel disconnected from the vote. A strong middle ground is proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors nationwide, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot security, audits, and recounts so every lawful vote is handled consistently. That approach respects federalism and rural concerns while making campaigns compete for more voters in more places, improving legitimacy no matter which party wins.",
    "546": "Presidential elections should be easier to explain in a civics classroom: the winner ought to reflect the most votes while communities in every state still feel seen, not written off as \u201csafe\u201d or \u201cflyover.\u201d A practical bridge is to keep the state-run framework but replace winner-take-all with proportional allocation (or join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with clear national baselines for access, audits, and recounts so the rules are consistent and trusted.

    "658": "Presidential elections should reward broad national support and feel like every ballot matters, instead of hinging on a few swing states or winner-take-all math that leaves most communities ignored. A practical compromise is to keep the state-run structure but allocate electors proportionally (or join the National Popular Vote compact once enough states agree), paired with clear nationwide standards for access, audits, and automatic recounts so results are easy to verify. The goal is a system that\u2019s fair, transparent, and hard to game\u2014built for trust the same way good operations are built: consistent rules, careful checks, and accountability.",
    "534": "A presidential election system should translate votes into outcomes in a way that\u2019s easy to audit, hard to game, and broadly seen as legitimate, while still respecting the federal reality that states run elections. A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College framework but end winner-take-all through proportional allocation (or a National Popular Vote compact), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, recount triggers, and post-election audits. That combination would reduce swing-state distortion, push candidates to compete in more places, and make it more likely that the winner aligns with the nationwide vote without abruptly discarding state influence.",
    "500": "Replacing winner-take-all rules with proportional allocation of electors\u2014and pairing that with clear, nationwide baselines for access, counting, audits, and recounts\u2014would make outcomes track voter intent more closely while preserving a meaningful role for states. If broader change is needed, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact offers a practical path that can be adopted without a sudden constitutional rupture, especially if combined with ranked-choice voting to ensure the winner has broad support. The shared goal should be an election system that treats every ballot as valuable, reduces swing-state distortion, and is transparent enough that families can trust the result even when their preferred candidate loses.",
    "4": "A presidential election system should work like a well-designed interface: simple to understand, hard to game, and fair so that every vote carries comparable weight without letting any region feel ignored.
