A practical, incremental path is to reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions through proportional or district allocation of electors, encourage ranked\u2011choice voting, and pursue an interstate compact or similar national measure only alongside uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and clear recount rules so reforms are administrable, bipartisan, and strengthen public trust.",
    "31": "Maintain the state-based framework while reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions by adopting proportional or district allocation of electors alongside uniform standards for ballot access, audited recounts, and clear certification rules. Such measured reforms preserve federalism and smaller\u2011state voices while making outcomes more transparent, trustworthy, and reflective of the popular will\u2014helping build bipartisan confidence without upending the Constitution.",
    "393": "Reform should balance the principle that every vote carry similar weight with respect for the role of states, favoring gradual, transparent steps\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors, ranked-choice ballots, or an interstate compact to reflect the national popular vote\u2014paired with uniform standards for access, counting, and audits. These practical, phased measures can preserve federal stability while restoring public trust and encouraging candidates to seek broad, cross\u2011regional support.",

Changes must be simple to administer and transparent so confidence is restored and campaigns are incentivized to engage broadly rather than chase a handful of battlegrounds. Like a well\u2011composed painting, the system should harmonize diverse colors without erasing individual strokes.",

Reforms should be incremental, simple to administer, and focused on transparency and stability so results are trusted and candidates must compete broadly instead of only in a few swing areas.",
    "228": "Practical, administrable reforms that preserve state authority while making each ballot feel equally meaningful will best sustain public trust. Implementing proportional or district-based allocation of electors alongside interstate compacts toward a national popular outcome, uniform standards for counting, and routine post\u2011election audits can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, encourage broader campaigning, and strengthen legitimacy without upending the constitutional framework.",

The goal should be a stable, trust-building system that balances regional voices with one-person, one-vote fairness and makes outcomes clear and widely accepted.",
    "754": "Elections should be engineered to produce clear, auditable outcomes that respect both individual votes and the federal role of states. A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework while reducing winner-take-all distortion\u2014by encouraging proportional or district allocation, an interstate compact to reflect the national popular vote, or ranked-choice ballots\u2014paired with uniform baseline standards, robust audits, and transparent recount rules so candidates must compete broadly and results are trusted.",
    "332": "An effective reform balances one-person-one-vote legitimacy with the constitutional role of states by pairing practical changes\u2014such as proportional or district-based electors, statewide ranked-choice voting, or an interstate compact advancing the national popular vote\u2014with uniform standards for ballot access, routine audits, and transparent recount rules.

Changes ought to be simple to administer, phased in with strong audits, and designed to rebuild trust across urban and rural communities.",

Pairing these changes with uniform standards for access, transparent audits, and clear recount rules can build bipartisan trust and incentivize candidates to campaign nationwide rather than focus on a handful of swing areas.",
    "81": "Well\u2011built systems are dependable, simple to operate, and produce outcomes people can verify, so reforms should focus on transparency, uniform baseline standards for counting and audits, and stronger protections for voting access.

Incremental, testable reforms\u2014such as uniform national standards for ballot access and audits, proportional or district-based allocation of electors, and voluntary interstate compacts or ranked-choice ballots where feasible\u2014can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, encourage broader campaigning, and rebuild public confidence without upending federal institutions.",
    "700": "Reforms to the Electoral College should preserve meaningful state voice while making every ballot feel equally consequential, using practical steps like proportional allocation of electors or an interstate compact that honors the national popular vote once clear, uniform safeguards are established.
