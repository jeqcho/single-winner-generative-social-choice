    "692": "A workable path balances respect for state voices with a clearer reflection of the national will by moving away from pure winner-take-all toward proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. A carefully phased interstate compact or adoption of ranked-choice voting can encourage candidates to campaign beyond a few swing areas while protecting smaller communities from being overlooked. Those reforms aim to boost public confidence and preserve stability without upending the federal structure.",
    "294": "Reasonable reform should preserve the federal balance that protects smaller communities while making every ballot feel like it carries comparable weight\u2014options include proportional or district-based allocation of electors or a carefully phased interstate popular-vote compact. National baseline standards for ballot access, transparent audits, automatic recount triggers, and a clear requirement that electors follow certified results should be implemented to build public trust and avoid sudden disruptions.",
    "272": "Healthy stewardship of the republic means protecting smaller communities and the integrity of each ballot while making sure the presidency reflects the broader public will. A practical path keeps the state-based framework but phases in proportional or district allocation of electors and a national-popular-vote compact only after uniform voting standards, robust audits, and ranked-choice safeguards are adopted to preserve stability, trust, and fair representation.",
    "800": "Preserve the federal balance that protects smaller and rural communities while making outcomes more reflective of the popular will; practical reforms can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions by moving to proportional or district allocation of electors or by carefully adopting an interstate popular\u2011vote compact with clear safeguards. Implement uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts to restore confidence, and consider ranked\u2011choice voting to ensure majority support without sudden upheaval. Phase changes deliberately and transparently so stability, local voice, and public trust are maintained.",
    "281": "A practical, service-minded reform should balance one-person\u2011one\u2011vote with protecting smaller communities by moving gradually toward a national popular vote\u2014via an interstate compact or proportional/district-based allocation of electors\u2014paired with ranked\u2011choice voting to ensure majority support. Nationwide baseline standards for ballot access, paper trails, robust audits, and clear recount rules are essential to build public trust and prevent a handful of swing areas from deciding everything.",
    "276": "Elections should feel like a canvas where every stroke matters and every community's colors are respected, so a workable bridge is to keep the state-based framework while shifting toward outcomes that better mirror the national popular will. Implementing an interstate popular-vote compact or proportional/district allocation\u2014paired with ranked-choice options, uniform voting standards, and robust audits and recount rules\u2014can protect smaller-state voices, strengthen public trust, and be phased in transparently to preserve stability.",
    "369": "Preserve the role of states in choosing presidents while making every ballot feel equally meaningful by shifting away from strict winner-take-all allocations toward proportional or district-based electors and supporting a National Popular Vote compact as a phased option. Couple those changes with uniform standards for ballot access, paper ballots and audits, and clear recount rules so outcomes are transparent and trusted across urban and rural communities. Reforms should prioritize simplicity, stability, and incentives for candidates to campaign broadly rather than chasing a handful of swing counties.",
    "234": "A credible reform should make every ballot feel equally valued while preserving meaningful local voice, pairing a move toward a national popular standard or proportional allocation of electors with uniform voting access, paper audits, and clear recount rules. Phased, bipartisan implementation\u2014using tools like ranked-choice voting and anti\u2011gerrymandering safeguards\u2014can encourage candidates to campaign broadly and reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions without abruptly dismantling the federal balance. Trust will follow clear, verifiable rules and steady change that protects smaller communities while aligning outcomes more closely with the popular will.",
    "784": "Preserve the constitutional role of states while making presidential outcomes more reflective of the national popular will by moving toward proportional allocation of electors or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact paired with ranked\u2011choice ballots. Uniform standards for ballot access, paper ballots and audits, limits on faithless electors, and a phased implementation plan will protect smaller communities, reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, and rebuild public confidence in the result.",
    "406": "Election rules should protect the federal balance that ensures smaller and rural communities are heard while making every vote feel equally meaningful. A practical, phased approach\u2014requiring electors to reflect certified state results, encouraging proportional or district-based allocation or an interstate popular-vote compact once a clear threshold of states agrees, and instituting uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts (with ranked-choice voting to secure majority support)\u2014can preserve stability while restoring public trust.",
    "203": "Preserve the balance between protecting smaller and rural communities and making every vote carry comparable weight by pursuing practical, phased reforms: require uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts, and encourage states to adopt proportional allocation or join an interstate popular\u2011vote compact. Pairing that transition with safeguards like ranked\u2011choice voting to ensure majority support, clear anti\u2011gerrymandering rules, and simple, transparent procedures will build public trust while keeping elections stable and fair for families and communities nationwide.",
    "778": "Elections should make every ballot feel equally meaningful while preserving states and smaller communities as meaningful voices in choosing national leaders. Practical, phased reforms\u2014such as a national popular-vote compact or proportional/district allocation of electors paired with ranked-choice voting, uniform ballot-access and audit standards, and clear recount rules\u2014can reduce winner-take-all distortions, broaden where campaigns compete, and rebuild trust in outcomes.",
    "400": "Elections should balance the federal role of states with the democratic principle that every vote carry comparable weight, so a practical path keeps the Electoral College\u2019s state-based framework while phasing in reforms that reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions\u2014such as proportional or district allocation of electors, support for an interstate popular\u2011vote compact, and ranked\u2011choice options to ensure majority support. Like tuning a reliable car, clear national standards for voter access, uniform counting and auditing, and firm rules against faithless electors will make the system harder to game, simpler to explain, and easier for communities large and small to trust.",
    "394": "A stable, rule-bound system that makes every lawful vote feel meaningful is preferable to abrupt upheaval, so the Electoral College should be preserved but modernized to reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions. Practical reforms\u2014binding electors to certified results, encouraging proportional or district allocation, and adopting uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts\u2014can protect smaller-state voice while better aligning outcomes with the popular will. Changes should be phased and transparent, with clear safeguards to build public trust.",
    "791": "Stable, trusted elections should make every lawful vote feel equally meaningful while preserving the voice of smaller and rural communities. A sensible path is to phase in practical reforms\u2014like proportional or district-based elector allocation, interstate agreements toward a national popular tally, broader use of ranked-choice ballots, and uniform standards for access, audits, and automatic recounts\u2014so outcomes reflect majority support without sudden upheaval. Transparent, simple rules and gradual implementation can build public confidence and encourage candidates to compete across the whole country.",
    "570": "Ensure every vote carries comparable weight while preserving states\u2019 meaningful voice; implement a phased, practical reform such as an interstate popular\u2011vote compact or mandatory proportional/district\u2011based allocation of electors paired with ranked\u2011choice ballots to reward broad support. Back these changes with uniform federal standards for ballot access, paper\u2011trail audits, clear recount triggers, and prohibitions on faithless electors, implemented gradually with bipartisan oversight to protect stability and public trust.",
    "573": "Preserving the states\u2019 role while making every ballot carry comparable weight calls for practical reforms\u2014such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors, uniform standards for voting access and secure, auditable counting, and stronger limits on faithless electors. Phased, transparent changes that encourage candidates to compete broadly rather than a handful of swing areas will protect smaller communities, reduce polarization, and build the public confidence necessary for any lasting reform.",
    "349": "A practical compromise would preserve the state-based framework while shifting outcomes to better reflect the national popular will\u2014for example through an interstate popular\u2011vote compact or proportional allocation of electors paired with ranked\u2011choice voting to encourage broader support. Paired with uniform standards for ballot access, robust audits and clear recount rules, and a phased, bipartisan implementation that protects smaller and rural communities, such reforms can make every vote feel meaningful and rebuild confidence in presidential elections.",
    "217": "Preserving state roles while making every lawful vote carry comparable weight calls for practical, phased reforms that build trust instead of provoking upheaval. Pairing an interstate national-popular-vote compact or proportional/district-based allocation with ranked-choice runoffs, uniform standards for ballot access and audits, and firm rules against faithless electors and gerrymandering can balance equality and federalism. Clear, enforceable procedures will keep transitions stable and encourage candidates to win broad support so both urban and rural communities feel respected.",
    "509": "Balance state sovereignty and equal voting weight by moving away from winner-take-all toward proportional or district-based allocation of electors, while using an interstate compact as a voluntary, gradual pathway to a national popular tally. Complement those changes with uniform, transparent standards for ballot access, paper audits, automatic recount triggers, and bans on faithless electors so outcomes are secure, understandable, and accepted across urban and rural communities.",
    "61": "Preserving states' voice while making each ballot carry comparable weight is essential, so reforms that reduce winner-take-all distortions\u2014like proportional or district-based allocation of electors or a carefully phased National Popular Vote compact\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting where feasible, deserve serious consideration. Nationwide baseline standards for ballot access, secure paper trails, and automatic recounts would build trust across urban and rural communities and make transitions less disruptive. Practical, transparent implementation with bipartisan oversight can help ensure candidates compete broadly rather than only in a few swing areas.",
    "510": "A fair reform should balance making every ballot carry comparable weight with protecting smaller and rural communities, favoring phased changes like proportional or district-based allocation and a national popular-vote compact only after uniform standards and robust audits are in place. Emphasizing clear, simple rules\u2014ranked-choice options, consistent ballot access, enforceable recount procedures, and strong audits\u2014will build trust across regions and reduce the incentive to focus only on a handful of battlegrounds. Practical, transparent implementation and steady stewardship will keep the system resilient, defensible, and broadly accepted.",
    "282": "A fair, practical solution should protect smaller communities and the state-based character of elections while making sure every lawful vote carries comparable weight. Move toward proportional allocation or an interstate popular-vote compact combined with ranked-choice runoffs, nationwide baseline rules for access and secure paper ballots, routine audits, and limits on faithless electors to restore confidence. Phase reforms with bipartisan oversight and targeted investment in local election administration so contests reward broad, cross-regional campaigning rather than a handful of swing areas.",
    "464": "Preserving the federal balance while ensuring each lawful vote carries meaningful weight is the pragmatic course: keep the Electoral College framework but require electors to follow certified state results, move toward proportional or district-based allocation, and set clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. These measured reforms protect smaller communities, reduce winner-take-all distortions, and rebuild public trust without upending the constitutional system.",
    "182": "Democratic rules should be straightforward, fair, and built so local communities aren\u2019t ignored while every lawful vote counts. A practical, phased approach would preserve the state-based framework but move toward proportional or district-based elector allocation, require electors to follow certified results, and set uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts to rebuild confidence and reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions.",
    "245": "Elections should be redesigned like a well-crafted composition\u2014clear, balanced, and respectful of every element\u2014so reforms must ensure each ballot carries comparable weight while preserving meaningful local voices.

    "138": "Election reform should be treated like restoring a cherished machine: preserve the federal balance that ensures smaller communities are heard while carefully calibrating rules so every vote carries comparable weight. Phased, bipartisan changes\u2014such as proportional or district allocation of electors, stronger uniform standards for access, auditable paper trails, and clear recount rules\u2014can reduce winner-take-all distortions, curb mistrust, and keep the system stable and defensible.",
    "264": "Like a well-composed sketch, the presidential system should balance equal voting weight with regional voice, protecting smaller and rural communities while making each ballot matter. Practical reforms include moving away from winner\u2011take\u2011all toward proportional or district allocation, or adopting a national popular vote compact alongside ranked\u2011choice voting, all backed by uniform standards for ballot access, paper trails, audits, and automatic recounts. Phased, transparent implementation that rewards broad, cross\u2011regional campaigning can preserve federal stability while restoring public trust.",

Phased, transparent implementation and stronger support for local election administration will build trust and keep the system stable as it becomes fairer.",
    "575": "A practical, hands-on reform honors stewardship of communities by preserving smaller states' voice while making every ballot carry comparable weight\u2014phasing in proportional or district-based allocation of electors and pursuing a national popular-vote compact only after nationwide standards for access, robust audits, and bans on faithless electors are established. Pairing that transition with ranked-choice voting and clear recount rules encourages broader, cross-regional campaigning and keeps the system stable and trusted rather than sudden or polarizing.",
    "249": "A healthy system must balance the principle that every vote carry equal weight with preserving meaningful voice for smaller and rural communities so candidates must earn support across the map. Practical, phased reforms\u2014such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors, a carefully implemented national popular vote compact, and wider use of ranked-choice voting\u2014should be paired with uniform access standards, strong audits, and anti\u2011gerrymandering protections to safeguard legitimacy.

A practical compromise pairs proportional or district-based allocation of electors and support for a carefully structured interstate popular\u2011vote compact with nationwide baseline standards for ballot access, durable paper audits, and automatic recount triggers, and it encourages ranked\u2011choice voting so winners build broader coalitions. These reforms can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, raise transparency, and help citizens across regions accept results as legitimate.",
    "268": "Grounded in practical experience in education and community life, the system should balance protecting smaller-state voices with the democratic principle that every vote carry comparable weight.

    "181": "Preserving the role of states in choosing the president while making every ballot feel like it carries similar weight offers the best path to both fairness and stability. A practical compromise is to phase in reforms such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors, stronger nationwide standards for ballot access, counting and audits, and clear rules to prevent faithless electors\u2014possibly paired with an interstate compact\u2014so rural and small-state voices remain protected as trust in outcomes grows.
