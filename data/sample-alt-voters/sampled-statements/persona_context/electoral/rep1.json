    "694": "Presidential elections should produce outcomes that feel legitimate to the broadest share of voters while still keeping states meaningfully involved in administration and accountability. A practical bridge is to curb winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once enough states join), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers so close races don\u2019t become chaos. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would further reduce spoiler fears and reward candidates who build wider coalitions across urban and rural communities.",
    "211": "The Electoral College should be retained for the geographic balance it provides, but tuned up so outcomes track voters more closely and the rules are easier to trust. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally or by congressional district, require electors to follow the certified vote, and adopt clear national baselines for recounts, audits, and accessible voting. That approach keeps states meaningfully involved while reducing swing-state distortion and lowering the temperature around close elections.",
    "791": "Presidential elections should feel simple and fair to anyone who works hard, follows the rules, and wants to believe their vote matters the same no matter where they live. A practical compromise is keeping states involved but ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, binding electors to the state result, and setting clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That approach protects regional voices without letting a handful of swing states dominate, and it makes outcomes easier to accept even when a community\u2019s preferred candidate loses.",
    "194": "The Electoral College can be retained for its role in balancing state interests, but it should be modernized so outcomes more consistently track voters\u2019 intent and are easier to accept in close years. A practical compromise is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with clear national baselines for audits, recount triggers, and ballot integrity so the rules are consistent and trustworthy. Such reforms would reduce swing-state distortion, encourage broader campaigning, and strengthen confidence without forcing an abrupt shift to a single national tally.",
    "537": "A presidential election system should be easy to trust and should make every vote matter, especially for people who see daily how being unheard can compound hardship. A practical bridge is to keep states administering elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through a widely adopted national popular-vote compact), paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That approach respects regional voices while reducing swing-state distortion and bringing outcomes closer to the country\u2019s overall will.",
    "477": "The Electoral College should be modernized to better align outcomes with the national popular will while keeping states meaningfully involved, primarily by ending winner-take-all and moving to proportional allocation of electors. Any change should come with clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, recount triggers, and binding electors to the certified state result so close elections are trusted and compliance is straightforward. A practical bridge is to pursue these reforms first and allow a broader shift\u2014such as a national popular-vote compact\u2014to take effect only with wide bipartisan adoption and transparent safeguards.",
    "212": "The Electoral College can be kept as a guardrail so presidents must earn support across many kinds of communities, but it should be made fairer and easier to trust. A sensible reform is to end winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional or district-based allocation, require electors to follow the voters, and set clear nationwide standards for recounts, audits, and secure voting procedures. That approach respects tradition and local voice while reducing the frustration when the national vote and the outcome don\u2019t match and when only a few swing states seem to matter.",
    "549": "The Electoral College should be updated so presidential outcomes track the national popular will more closely while keeping states meaningfully involved in administering elections. A workable bridge is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or using a carefully designed popular-vote compact), paired with uniform national baselines for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers so results are transparent and trusted. That combination would reduce swing-state distortion, encourage broader coalition-building, and make it easier for communities in every region to feel seen without turning elections into a constant legal fight.",
    "797": "The Electoral College should be kept as a guardrail for regional balance, but updated so outcomes track voters more closely and feel easier to trust. A practical middle ground is ending winner-take-all by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation, requiring electors to follow the state vote, and setting clear national baselines for audits, recounts, and accessible voting for people with disabilities. That approach keeps smaller communities from being written off while reducing \u201cswing-state\u201d distortion and strengthening confidence that every lawful ballot matters.",
    "300": "The Electoral College should be kept as a guardrail so presidents have to earn support across the country, not just run up totals in a few major metros, but it needs practical fixes to feel fair and trustworthy. A strong middle ground is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional or district-based elector allocation, along with clear national standards for audits, recounts, and accessible voting so close elections don\u2019t turn into chaos. Requiring electors to follow their state\u2019s results and tightening transparent rules would honor tradition while making more voters feel their ballot truly counts.",
    "25": "The Electoral College should be modernized so the winner more consistently reflects the most votes, without making smaller and rural communities feel like they\u2019ve been written out of the conversation. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through a broad, bipartisan popular-vote compact), while requiring electors to follow the voters and setting clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That combination keeps the state-based structure people trust, reduces swing-state distortion, and makes elections easier to accept\u2014no matter which side wins.",
    "261": "Presidential elections should feel as straightforward as a well-written recipe: every valid vote should count, and the rules should be consistent from state to state so working families can trust the result. A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, paired with clear national standards for access, counting, audits, and recounts. That respects concerns about smaller states being ignored while reducing the \u201cswing state\u201d problem and making outcomes match the people\u2019s will more closely.",
    "616": "Replacing the winner-take-all approach with proportional allocation of electoral votes in every state would better match outcomes to voter intent while still keeping states meaningfully involved. Pairing that change with uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races would strengthen trust the way clear bookkeeping rules prevent disputes. Over time, a National Popular Vote compact\u2014ideally alongside ranked-choice voting\u2014could honor the principle that every vote should matter without leaving rural, urban, and suburban communities feeling written off.",
    "256": "Presidential elections should be decided in a way that feels fair to working families and credible enough that people accept the result, especially when close margins and inconsistent state rules create doubt. A strong middle path is keeping the state-based framework but ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, binding electors to the state vote, and setting clear national standards for access, counting, audits, and recounts so voters\u2014including those with disabilities\u2014aren\u2019t boxed out. If broader agreement develops, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a careful bridge toward honoring the national popular will without ignoring regional voices.",
    "247": "Presidential elections should reward broad, nationwide support while making each ballot feel equally meaningful, rather than hinging on a few swing states or winner-take-all margins. A durable middle path is to keep state administration but require proportional allocation of electors, bind electors to the certified vote, and adopt clear national standards for access, paper audits, and recount triggers so results are trusted. If the country is ready for a bigger step, the National Popular Vote compact\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting\u2014can align outcomes with the popular will while still encouraging candidates to compete everywhere, not just in the biggest metros.",
    "136": "The Electoral College doesn\u2019t need to be scrapped, but it does need a tune-up so the system runs cleaner and people trust the result, especially when the popular vote and outcome don\u2019t match. A practical middle ground is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation in every state, locking in rules against faithless electors, and setting clear national standards for recounts and audits. That keeps states and smaller communities from being steamrolled while making more votes matter in every state, not just the handful that get all the campaign attention.",
    "76": "Presidential elections should feel fair and inclusive, with every vote carrying meaningful weight while still respecting the role states play in holding the system together. A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, require electors to follow the voters, and adopt clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so results are trusted. If broader consensus develops, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a careful next step without disrupting election administration overnight.",
    "3": "A stable election system should respect the states\u2019 role while making it plain as day that every lawful vote matters, not just the ones cast in a few battlegrounds. A practical reform is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, bind electors to the state vote, and set uniform national standards for ballot access, paper audits, and recount triggers. That approach honors local communities without letting geography override the popular will, and it would cut down on the kind of political gamesmanship that\u2019s bad for public trust and even worse for long-term stewardship of the country.",
    "754": "Presidential elections should work like a well-engineered network: transparent, auditable, and consistent across states so trust doesn\u2019t depend on which jurisdiction someone lives in. A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or via the district method) and require electors to follow the voters, backed by uniform national standards for recount triggers, paper-audit trails, and ballot access. That preserves federalism and regional attention while making outcomes track the popular will more closely and reducing the incentive to campaign only in a handful of battleground states.",
    "187": "The Electoral College can remain a guardrail for regional balance, but it should be tightened so the outcome tracks voters more closely and feels worth trusting. Replacing winner-take-all with proportional or district-based elector allocation, binding electors to the certified result, and adopting clear nationwide standards for audits and recounts would make more ballots matter without turning the presidency into a pure big-city contest. Reforms should be simple to explain, hard to game, and focused on legitimacy so people can accept the result even when it doesn\u2019t go their way.",
    "128": "Presidential elections should be decided in a way that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and respectful of both equal votes and the states\u2019 role, because legitimacy matters more than clever advantages. A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College framework but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and requiring electors to follow the certified vote, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. If the country wants to go further, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a cautious step toward matching the national popular will without forcing an abrupt constitutional rupture.",
    "489": "The Electoral College can be preserved as a federal safeguard so smaller states and rural communities are not brushed aside, while still reducing the frustration that comes when the outcome clashes with the national vote. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with a small statewide share), require electors to follow the voters, and set clear national baselines for audits, recount triggers, and ballot access so results are easier to trust. Reforms should be cautious, transparent, and aimed at rewarding broad coalitions rather than a handful of battleground states.",
    "266": "Presidential elections should better reflect the nationwide popular will while keeping states meaningfully involved, since legitimacy depends on both equal voice and broad geographic buy-in. A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by moving to proportional elector allocation (or the National Popular Vote compact once widely adopted), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so outcomes are transparent and trusted. Reforms should reduce swing-state obsession, encourage candidates to engage more communities, and strengthen confidence that every lawful vote matters.",
    "407": "The Electoral College can be kept as a guardrail so presidents have to win support beyond a few big cities, but it should be updated so working people in every state feel their vote matters and the rules are easy to trust. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by moving to proportional or district-based elector allocation, require electors to follow the voters, and set clear national standards for audits, recounts, and basic ballot security. That keeps the states\u2019 role while making outcomes feel fairer and reducing the sense that only a handful of swing places decide everything.",
    "179": "The presidency should be decided in a way that feels plainly fair and understandable, so the winner reflects the most voters while states still have a meaningful role in administering secure elections. A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College framework but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and requiring electors to follow the state vote, paired with clear national standards for access, paper audits, and recounts that work for seniors and people with disabilities. Over time, broad agreement on a national popular-vote compact could further align outcomes with the public will while reducing the sense that a few swing states decide everything.",
    "449": "Presidential elections should feel as legitimate as a well-staged production: the rules must be clear, the count transparent, and the outcome aligned with the audience\u2019s will. A durable compromise would keep states administering elections but end winner\u2011take\u2011all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (and binding electors to the vote), while setting uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. Over time, broad buy\u2011in for a National Popular Vote compact\u2014ideally paired with ranked\u2011choice voting\u2014could further reduce swing\u2011state distortion while still encouraging candidates to build truly national coalitions.",
    "47": "Electoral College reform should preserve the federal balance that keeps candidates attentive to more than the largest metros, while making outcomes track the will of voters more closely and predictably. A practical compromise is to keep the constitutional framework but end winner-take-all through proportional or district-based allocation, require electors to be bound to the vote, and adopt uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers. Changes like these reduce swing-state distortion, limit post-election litigation, and strengthen public confidence without forcing an abrupt shift to a single nationwide tally.",
    "493": "A presidential election system should reward the candidate with the broadest support while still respecting the role states play in administering elections and representing distinct communities. A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College framework but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so outcomes are transparent and trusted. If that still leaves too many voters feeling sidelined, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014ideally alongside ranked-choice voting\u2014offers a responsible path to align the result with the popular will without inviting endless close-race chaos.",
    "636": "The Electoral College can be kept to preserve a balance between regions, but it should be tightened so outcomes track the voters more closely and the rules are plain and consistent. A workable compromise is to end winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally or by district, require electors to follow the vote, and set uniform national standards for audits, recounts, and ballot security. That approach protects smaller communities from being ignored while reducing the sense that a handful of swing states\u2014or a few legal fights\u2014decide everything.",
    "593": "A presidential election system should be as transparent and fault-tolerant as well-built software: every valid vote should reliably translate into the outcome, with uniform rules for access, counting, audits, and recount triggers. The most workable bridge is keeping state-run elections while ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors and binding electors to their state\u2019s results, or using the National Popular Vote compact once broad buy-in exists. Pairing either approach with ranked-choice voting would reduce spoiler effects and push candidates to build wider coalitions beyond a handful of battleground states.",
    "777": "Presidential elections should feel fair and straightforward to working families, which means reducing the winner-take-all distortion that makes millions of votes in \u201csafe\u201d states feel pointless while still keeping states responsible for running elections. A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College but require proportional allocation of electors in every state, bind electors to the state result, and adopt clear national baseline standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. If broad buy-in develops over time, a National Popular Vote compact could serve as a next step, provided it comes with transparent safeguards that help rural and urban communities trust the outcome.",
    "6": "The Electoral College should be retained for geographic balance, but modernized so outcomes better match how people actually vote and so the rules feel consistent and trustworthy. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional or district-based allocation of electors nationwide, along with clear federal baseline standards for audits, recount triggers, and ballot access. That keeps states meaningfully involved while reducing swing-state distortion and making it easier for voters across urban, suburban, and rural communities to accept close results.",
    "463": "The Electoral College should be modernized so the winner more reliably reflects the national popular will, while keeping states meaningfully involved so rural and smaller communities don\u2019t feel written off. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear national baselines for accessibility, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers that work for voters with disabilities. To reduce spoiler fears and lower the temperature, states should be encouraged to adopt ranked-choice voting for presidential ballots so candidates have incentives to build broader coalitions instead of chasing a few battleground margins.",
    "470": "The Electoral College should be kept as a state-based guardrail, but \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d should be replaced with proportional or district-based allocation so fewer voters feel written off in safe states and fewer elections hinge on a handful of battlegrounds. Any change should come with uniform, transparent national standards for counting, recounts, and audits, plus binding rules that prevent faithless electors, so the outcome is clear, trusted, and hard to game. That approach respects federalism and local voice while bringing results closer to the country\u2019s overall vote and encouraging candidates to earn support across more communities.",
    "618": "The Electoral College doesn\u2019t need to be scrapped to be fairer; the biggest fix is ending winner-take-all so electoral votes are allocated proportionally (or by district with safeguards), making outcomes track voters more closely while keeping states meaningfully involved. Any change should come with clear, uniform national baselines for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount triggers, because trust depends on consistent rules and a count that can be verified. A pragmatic compromise is to modernize the machinery without turning presidential elections into a coast-to-coast legal fight, so urban and rural communities alike feel neither ignored nor overruled.",
    "605": "A presidential election system should be modernized so legitimacy tracks the public\u2019s choice while still encouraging candidates to build support across diverse regions, not just a few battleground states. The most workable bridge is to keep state administration but end winner\u2011take\u2011all through proportional allocation of electors (or a widely adopted popular\u2011vote compact), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers. Such reforms reduce gamesmanship, make more ballots matter in every state, and strengthen trust that the outcome reflects both democratic consent and the country\u2019s geographic breadth.",
    "326": "The Electoral College should be reformed so outcomes track the national popular will more closely while keeping states meaningfully involved, since legitimacy comes from both fairness and a system people can understand. A practical middle path is ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once broad buy-in exists), paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close elections don\u2019t become endless court fights. That approach reduces swing-state distortions without telling rural communities their voice doesn\u2019t matter\u2014shikata ga nai, the goal is rules that are simple, trusted, and stable enough that losers accept the result.",
    "671": "The Electoral College should be modernized so outcomes track the national popular will more closely while still keeping states meaningful in how elections are run. A practical compromise is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, binding electors to the certified result, and setting clear national standards for audits and recounts so close races don\u2019t spiral into chaos. That approach treats every ballot as worth fighting for\u2014whether cast in a deep-red, deep-blue, or swing state\u2014while preserving geographic balance and rebuilding trust in the result.",
    "686": "The Electoral College can be kept as a guardrail that encourages candidates to pay attention to smaller communities, but it should be tuned up so the outcome matches voters more closely and feels plainly fair. Ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional or district-based allocation, requiring electors to follow the vote, and setting clear national standards for audits, recounts, and accessible voting would reduce suspicion and make more ballots matter. That kind of practical repair respects the Constitution\u2019s federal design while strengthening legitimacy and trust\u2014especially in close elections.",
    "490": "The Electoral College should be kept for the geographic balance it provides, but modernized so outcomes track voters more closely and are easier to trust. Ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional or district-based elector allocation, combined with strict rules that electors must follow the vote, would make more ballots matter in every state. Any change should come with clear, uniform national standards for voter ID options, audits, and recount triggers so close elections are settled by transparent procedures instead of endless lawsuits.",
    "82": "A presidential election system should be as transparent and fault-tolerant as well-designed infrastructure: every valid vote needs to \u201croute\u201d cleanly to a result people can verify and accept. Common ground lies in keeping state-run administration but replacing winner-take-all with proportional allocation (or a carefully structured national popular-vote compact), while binding electors to the voters\u2019 outcome and setting uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers. Pairing that with ranked-choice voting would reduce spoiler dynamics and push candidates to build broader coalitions beyond a handful of battleground states.",
    "13": "The Electoral College should be retained for its role in balancing regions, but modernized so outcomes more consistently reflect voters and reduce the sense that only a few battleground states matter. A practical compromise is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional or district-based allocation of electors, binding electors to the state result, and setting clear nationwide standards for recounts, audits, and secure ballot handling. That approach protects smaller communities from being ignored while making the rules easier to trust, explain, and accept\u2014even in close elections.",
    "191": "A sensible reform would keep state administration and the federal balance many communities value, but end winner\u2011take\u2011all allocations so presidential outcomes track the popular vote more closely through proportional electors or a National Popular Vote compact. To rebuild trust and reduce the \u201cbattleground state\u201d obsession, any change should be paired with clear, uniform national baselines for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers. The goal is a system that rewards broad, cross\u2011regional coalitions and feels fair and predictable to voters whether their state is safely red, safely blue, or truly competitive.",
    "110": "The Electoral College should be reformed so the winner more consistently reflects the national popular will while still keeping a meaningful role for states, since legitimacy matters as much as stability. A practical compromise is to end winner\u2011take\u2011all by allocating electors proportionally (or through a broad, carefully designed popular\u2011vote compact) and to require clear national standards for accessible voting, audits, and recounts so seniors and people with disabilities aren\u2019t left behind. Pairing these changes with a ban on faithless electors would make the rules simpler to understand, harder to game, and easier for communities to accept even when their side loses.",
    "790": "The Electoral College should be kept as a federal guardrail, but the \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortion has to go so outcomes track voters more closely and campaigns stop treating most states like flyover territory. A workable compromise is proportional allocation of electors in every state, binding electors to the certified vote, and clear nationwide standards for audits, recount triggers, and accessible voting so the rules are consistent and hard to game. That mix preserves regional balance while strengthening the legitimacy and transparency needed for peaceful acceptance of results.",
    "660": "Presidential elections should feel as fair and transparent as a well-run studio: every vote should matter, the rules should be easy to understand, and the outcome should match the public\u2019s will closely enough that losing sides still accept it. A strong bridge is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state, while adopting uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts to reduce mistrust and litigation.

A practical middle path is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or by district, require electors to follow the certified state result, and adopt clear nationwide baselines for audits, recount triggers, and ballot security.

Over time, a national popular-vote outcome\u2014implemented through a carefully designed compact or amendment, ideally with ranked-choice voting\u2014can honor the principle that every ballot matters while still encouraging candidates to build broad, cross-regional coalitions.",
    "398": "The Electoral College should be retained to preserve the federal balance and ensure presidents earn support across regions, but it needs reforms that make outcomes easier to justify and harder to game. States should move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or by congressional district, while requiring electors to follow the certified vote.

The most practical bridge is ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors (or a carefully designed popular-vote compact), paired with uniform nationwide standards for ballot access, paper-auditability, recount triggers, and binding electors to results. That approach reduces swing-state distortion, strengthens legitimacy, and preserves geographic balance without rewriting the entire system overnight.",
    "45": "A presidential election system should reward broad national support while still giving every region a reason to stay engaged, and the current winner-take-all approach too often turns the process into a handful of battleground contests. A practical bridge is to keep the state-based framework but require electors to reflect actual votes through proportional allocation (or a carefully designed popular-vote compact), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers so outcomes are transparent and trusted. That combination respects federalism concerns without excusing outcomes that repeatedly diverge from the popular will, and it reduces incentives for partisan gamesmanship in close races.",
    "285": "Presidential elections should reflect the national popular will more closely while preserving a meaningful role for states, so a practical reform is ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors and binding electors to their state\u2019s certified results. Pairing that with clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers would make outcomes easier to understand and harder to game, reducing the sense that only a few swing states matter. A longer-term bridge\u2014if broad buy-in exists\u2014is a national popular vote implemented through a constitutional amendment or carefully designed compact, ideally with ranked-choice voting to reward coalition-building and lower the temperature.",
    "348": "The Electoral College should be kept as a federal guardrail so candidates can\u2019t win by running up margins in a few major metros while ignoring the rest of the country, but it needs practical updates that make outcomes feel fair and easy to trust. States should move away from winner-take-all toward proportional or district-based allocation, require electors to follow the voters, and adopt clear nationwide baselines for recounts, audits, and ballot standards. That combination preserves regional balance, reduces \u201cswing-state\u201d gamesmanship, and makes every community\u2019s vote matter without blowing up the whole system.",
    "54": "The Electoral College should be updated so the winner more reliably reflects the people\u2019s choice while keeping states meaningfully involved, beginning with ending winner-take-all and moving to proportional allocation of electors paired with clear rules that bind electors to the state vote. A national baseline for accessible voting, paper-audit recounts, and straightforward certification would strengthen trust and participation, especially for seniors and people with disabilities. If broad bipartisan buy-in develops, the National Popular Vote compact or a constitutional amendment could provide a clean national popular-vote outcome without turning elections into a coast-to-coast recount fight.",
    "755": "The Electoral College should be updated so the winner more consistently reflects the most votes while keeping states meaningfully involved, because a system people can explain and trust is what protects peaceful outcomes. A strong middle-ground reform is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state, backed by uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races. That approach reduces swing-state distortion, makes more communities worth campaigning in, and strengthens legitimacy without demanding an overnight constitutional rewrite.",
