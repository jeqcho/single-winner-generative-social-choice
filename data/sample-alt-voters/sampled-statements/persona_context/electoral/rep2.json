    "381": "The Electoral College should be kept for its role in balancing regions, but the winner-take-all setup should be replaced with proportional allocation so close races don\u2019t turn millions of votes into zero representation. Any reform should come with clear, uniform rules for voter verification, ballot handling, and automatic audits so results are easier to trust and harder to fight over. This middle path respects the states while making campaigns compete beyond a handful of swing areas and aligning outcomes more closely with what voters actually choose.",
    "70": "Reform should respect the Constitution\u2019s state-based balance while addressing the frustration that winner-take-all rules can make millions of votes feel irrelevant and drive campaigns into a handful of battlegrounds. A practical middle ground would keep the Electoral College but require proportional or district-based allocation with strong safeguards against gerrymandering, along with clear nationwide standards for audits, recounts, and binding electors to the certified vote. That approach promotes fairness and election confidence without turning presidential campaigns into a pure big-city numbers contest.",
    "396": "The Electoral College should be modernized so outcomes track the will of voters more closely without erasing the role states play in holding elections and keeping regional concerns on the table. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation of electors (or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it reaches the threshold), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close results are trusted. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would help ensure the winner earns broad support and reduce the zero-sum incentives that leave many communities feeling ignored.",
    "0": "A durable reform should keep states central to administering elections while making the outcome track the national will more closely, so fewer communities feel written off as \u201csafe\u201d and ignored. A practical bridge is moving away from winner-take-all toward proportional allocation of electors (or a popular-vote compact once broadly adopted), paired with clear nationwide baseline standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers. Adding ranked-choice voting for president can help ensure a true majority mandate and lower the temperature by rewarding broader, cross-regional coalitions.",
    "130": "Presidential elections should honor the principle that every vote matters while still respecting the role states play in holding elections and keeping rural and urban communities engaged. A practical reform would move away from winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, with ranked-choice ballots to ensure the winner has broad support. Pairing that with clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts would reduce \u201cswing-state\u201d distortion and help more people trust the outcome.",
    "214": "Presidential elections should follow clear, enforceable rules that the public can audit and accept, because legitimacy and public order depend on trust in the count. The Electoral College can be kept, but winner-take-all should be replaced with proportional or district-based allocation, paired with uniform national standards for voter verification, chain of custody, audits, and recount triggers. That approach preserves a meaningful role for states and smaller communities while making outcomes track the voters more closely and reducing the sense that only a few battleground areas decide everything.",
    "297": "The Electoral College should be updated to better match the public\u2019s choice while keeping a meaningful role for states, since legitimacy depends on both fairness and a system people can understand. A practical compromise would end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts so close elections don\u2019t turn into chaos. Over time, a national popular-vote solution\u2014ideally with ranked-choice voting\u2014could further reduce \u201cswing state\u201d distortion while still rewarding candidates who build support across many kinds of communities.",
    "252": "Electoral College reform should strengthen legitimacy without discarding the state-based balance that helps rural and urban communities accept the same outcome. A practical middle path is to keep the framework but curb winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional or district-based allocation with safeguards against gerrymandering, while requiring electors to follow the vote and setting clear national baselines for voter-roll integrity, chain-of-custody, audits, and recounts. The goal is a system that is orderly, transparent, and hard to game, so the winner earns broad support and the public can trust the result even in close elections.",
    "484": "The Electoral College should be updated so elections feel fair to everyday voters while still keeping states and smaller communities from getting brushed off in presidential campaigns. A strong compromise is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional elector allocation in every state (or using the National Popular Vote compact once enough states join), paired with clear national standards for ballot access, counting, and automatic recounts. That mix would make more votes matter in every state, cut down on \u201cswing state\u201d games, and help people trust the result even when their side takes an L.",
    "353": "Keeping the Electoral College can still make sense for a big country where rural and urban communities both deserve a real voice, but it should be updated so fewer voters feel written off in \u201csafe\u201d states. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or with a fair district method), require electors to follow the voters, and pair that with clear national standards for secure ballots, audits, and recounts. That keeps the state-based balance many value while making outcomes feel more transparent, more representative, and easier to accept even when the result disappoints.",
    "637": "The Electoral College should be kept for the stability it provides and the way it pushes candidates to earn support across many states, but it needs updates so fewer voters feel written off by winner\u2011take\u2011all outcomes. A practical compromise is proportional allocation of electors within every state, paired with clear national baseline rules for ballots, audits, and timely recounts so results are transparent and trusted. Reforms should reward broad coalitions without turning elections into a system where only the biggest media markets or a handful of swing counties matter.",
    "449": "A healthier presidential election should honor the democratic instinct that each ballot deserves equal weight while respecting the federal reality that states and regions need to feel seen, not bypassed. The most workable bridge is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide or to implement the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, ideally paired with ranked-choice voting so winners earn broad support instead of gaming spoilers. Whatever the mechanism, uniform baseline standards for ballot access, recounts, and transparent audits would reduce suspicion and make close outcomes easier to accept.",
    "253": "A presidential election should feel like a finished canvas: every vote adding its true color, not disappearing under a winner-take-all varnish in a few battleground states. The strongest bridge is moving toward the national popular will\u2014through the National Popular Vote compact or proportional elector allocation\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting so winners earn real majority support. To respect those who value state roles and stability, any change should include clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts so the process is transparent, secure, and easier to accept even in close races.",
    "552": "A practical reform should make presidential outcomes track the national popular will more closely while preserving the stabilizing role states play in administering elections. The strongest bridge is a National Popular Vote Interstate Compact paired with ranked-choice voting and uniform baseline standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts, so every vote matters without turning elections into a scramble for a few swing states or just the biggest media markets. If full adoption remains out of reach, requiring proportional allocation of electors within states and binding electors to the certified result would still reduce winner-take-all distortions and strengthen legitimacy across regions.",
    "625": "A durable reform should keep the state-based structure people associate with federalism while making outcomes track voter intent more closely by ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation or a national popular vote agreement. Pairing that with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts would reduce spoiler fears, shrink \u201cswing state\u201d distortion, and make close results easier to trust. The goal is a system that rewards candidates for building broad, cross-regional coalitions rather than gaming geography, while still leaving every community confident its votes meaningfully shape the result.",
    "74": "The Electoral College should be modified so presidential results track the national will more closely while still keeping states meaningfully involved in running elections. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it has broad support), paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, paper-audit trails, and automatic recount thresholds. That would reduce swing-state distortions, make every vote matter in every state, and protect the kind of transparency and stability that helps people accept close outcomes even when they disagree.",
    "570": "Presidential elections work best when the rules are clear, auditable, and consistent\u2014so outcomes reflect voters rather than procedural quirks or a handful of battleground states. A practical bridge is to keep state administration but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with uniform baseline standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recounts in close contests. If the country is ready for a bigger step, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014ideally combined with ranked-choice voting\u2014can honor \u201cone person, one vote\u201d while still rewarding candidates who earn broad, cross-regional support.",
    "619": "The Electoral College should be kept for its state-and-region balance, but the winner-take-all setup needs tuning so fewer voters feel ignored and fewer elections hinge on a couple of swing counties. A practical compromise is proportional allocation of electors in every state, strict requirements that electors follow the vote, and clear nationwide baseline rules for voter verification, paper-backed auditing, and automatic recount thresholds. That preserves federalism and rural voice while making outcomes track the public will more closely and easier for people to trust when margins are tight.",
    "257": "A workable reform should keep the state-based guardrails that help rural and smaller communities feel they still matter, while reducing the winner-take-all distortions that turn a few swing states into the whole ballgame. Requiring proportional allocation of electors (or a district method with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) and binding electors to the certified results, paired with clear nationwide baseline standards for voter ID options, paper-audit trails, and automatic recount triggers, would make outcomes easier to verify and accept. The goal is a system that rewards broad, cross-regional support and gives everyday voters confidence the rules are solid no matter who wins.",
    "86": "The Electoral College should be kept for the stability it provides and for the way it protects smaller communities from being overlooked, but it needs practical updates so the result feels fair and understandable to everyday voters. States should move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, while also requiring electors to follow the voters and setting clear, uniform standards for voter ID options, paper-backed audits, and recounts. That kind of reform respects the constitutional balance, strengthens election integrity, and reduces the sense that only a handful of swing states decide everything.",
    "727": "A presidential election system should be easy to explain in a classroom and fair enough that voters in every community feel their ballot matters, not just those in a few swing states. A practical bridge is to keep the state-run structure but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with baseline national standards for access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount rules. Over time, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014ideally alongside ranked-choice voting\u2014can better align outcomes with the national will while still encouraging candidates to build broad, cross-regional coalitions.",
    "463": "Presidential elections should make it easier for everyday voters to trust that every ballot matters, not just those cast in a few swing states, while still respecting that different states and rural communities don\u2019t want to be steamrolled. A practical bridge is moving toward the National Popular Vote outcome\u2014ideally with ranked-choice voting so winners have real majority support\u2014paired with clear, nationwide standards for accessible voting, paper-backed audits, and straightforward recount rules. If full replacement isn\u2019t feasible yet, requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state would reduce winner-take-all distortions without wiping out the state role entirely.",
    "521": "A presidential election system should be easy to explain to kids, hard to game, and trusted the way a well-run public institution is trusted\u2014clear rules, solid audits, and equal respect for every lawful ballot. The most workable bridge is to keep a state role but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with uniform baseline standards for ballot access, recounts, and paper-backed verification. That approach reduces swing-state roulette, better matches the people\u2019s overall choice, and still reassures smaller communities they won\u2019t be ignored.",
    "762": "The Electoral College should be kept for its state-based balance, but the winner-take-all setup deserves an upgrade so fewer voters feel written off and campaigns aren\u2019t just a scramble for a handful of swing states. Requiring states to allocate electors proportionally or by congressional district (with strong safeguards against gerrymandering), plus firm rules that bind electors to the vote, would better reflect real margins without scrapping the constitutional framework. Whatever model is chosen, consistent national standards for voter verification, paper-backed audits, and clear recount triggers would do the most to restore trust across rural and urban communities.",
    "209": "Presidential elections should work like a solid jobsite plan: clear rules, the same standards everywhere, and a result most people can trust even when it\u2019s close. A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and requiring electors to follow the vote, while setting national baselines for access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recounts. That would make every ballot matter more beyond swing states without turning the country into a campaign that only chases big media markets.",
    "280": "Electoral College reform should focus on making outcomes match voters\u2019 intent more closely while keeping states meaningfully involved, so families in every \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cswing\u201d state feel their ballots matter. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional elector allocation nationwide, paired with clear, consistent standards for ballot access, recounts, and audits to build trust. If the country wants to go further, the National Popular Vote compact\u2014ideally with ranked-choice voting to ensure a true majority\u2014can honor one person, one vote without turning campaigns into a few media markets. The best test for any change is whether it strengthens equality, protects freedom of expression, and lowers the temperature enough that people can accept the result and get back to building community.",
    "362": "Presidential elections should feel as fair and steady as good shelter routines: clear rules, transparent checks, and outcomes that reflect what most voters actually chose, not just who won a few high-stress battlegrounds. A practical bridge is to keep the state role but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote compact once it has broad buy-in), paired with baseline national standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers. That combination respects smaller-state concerns about being ignored while honoring the simple idea that every vote should carry comparable weight, wherever it\u2019s cast.",
    "270": "A presidential election system works best when it\u2019s transparent, auditable, and leaves voters in every community feeling their voice genuinely matters, much like a care plan that treats the whole person and the supports around them. A practical bridge is to keep state administration but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with baseline national standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount rules. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would help ensure a true majority mandate and reduce spoiler fears, while still pushing candidates to earn broad, cross-regional support.",
    "27": "Presidential elections should feel as fair and straightforward as a clean tally at the end of a busy shift: every ballot matters, and the rules don\u2019t change depending on where someone lives. A strong reform would move toward the national popular vote\u2014ideally through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting and clear national standards for access, paper-backed audits, and recounts so results are trusted. If that full step is politically out of reach, states should at least end winner-take-all and allocate electors proportionally to reduce \u201cswing state\u201d distortions while still respecting the role of states.",
    "95": "A presidential election system should treat each vote with comparable weight while still honoring the role states play and the real fear that rural and smaller communities could be ignored. A practical bridge is moving away from winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact paired with ranked-choice voting so the winner earns a true majority. Any shift should come with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, recounts, and transparent audits so outcomes are both fair and trusted, even in close races.",
    "329": "Presidential elections should be decided by rules that are simple to understand, hard to game, and treat every lawful ballot with comparable weight, while still keeping states responsible for running elections. A practical compromise is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or a district method with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) and binding electors to the vote, paired with clear nationwide baselines for ID options, paper-audit trails, and recount triggers. That approach reduces swing-state roulette, rewards candidates who earn broad support across regions, and strengthens trust without demanding an all-at-once constitutional rewrite.",
    "633": "Presidential elections should be simple to understand and fair to working families, so the winner reflects the most votes while smaller communities still feel seen. A practical bridge is to keep the state-based structure but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount rules in close races. That approach reduces \u201cswing-state\u201d politics, makes outcomes easier to accept, and protects trust without forcing an abrupt, all-or-nothing change.",
    "532": "The Electoral College should be kept for the stability it provides and the way it forces candidates to pay attention beyond the biggest cities, but it needs a practical tune\u2011up so results feel fair and easy to trust. A strong middle ground is ending winner\u2011take\u2011all by moving to proportional allocation of electors, backed by clear national standards for paper-backed counting, audits, and recounts so close races don\u2019t turn into chaos. That approach respects the constitutional balance many conservatives value while making more votes matter in every state, not just a few battlegrounds.",
    "134": "Presidential elections should feel as fair and evidence-based as any high-stakes decision, with transparent rules that let every vote count while still recognizing that a huge country has distinct communities that don\u2019t want to be ignored. A strong bridge is ending winner-take-all by moving states to proportional elector allocation and pairing it with uniform national standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount thresholds. Over time, a national popular vote approach\u2014ideally with ranked-choice voting to ensure a true majority\u2014can align the result with the broad public will while keeping campaigns accountable to more than just a few battlegrounds.",
    "92": "The Electoral College can be made fairer without pretending geography should outweigh voters, by ending winner-take-all and requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state so fewer ballots feel \u201cwasted\u201d and fewer elections hinge on a handful of swing counties. In parallel, baseline national standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers would make outcomes easier to trust while leaving administration in state hands. A longer-term off-ramp\u2014such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact paired with ranked-choice voting\u2014could align the presidency with the popular will while still encouraging candidates to seek support across regions, not just media markets.",
    "161": "The Electoral College should be kept for its role in balancing regions and encouraging broad coalitions, but the winner-take-all habit in most states ought to be replaced with proportional (or well-guarded district) allocation so more voters feel represented. Any update should come with clear, uniform baseline rules for ballot access, secure counting, audits, and timely recounts so close elections don\u2019t turn into bitterness and doubt. This kind of reform respects constitutional federalism and election integrity while better matching results to the will of the people.",
    "712": "A presidential election system should feel as fair and trustworthy as any high-stakes care plan: every lawful vote handled consistently, transparently, and with respect, no matter the state. The clearest bridge is moving away from winner-take-all\u2014through proportional electoral votes or a National Popular Vote compact\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting so winners earn broad support and fewer voters feel \u201cwasted.\u201d Common ground also exists in setting uniform national baselines for ballot access, audits, and recounts, while leaving states room to run elections in ways that fit local communities. These steps can honor regional voices without letting a handful of swing states\u2014or narrow margins\u2014decide everything.",
    "626": "A durable reform should keep the state-based structure that helps smaller communities feel represented while making outcomes track the voters more closely and predictably. Ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform national baseline rules for ballots, audits, and automatic recounts in tight races, would reduce \u201cswing-state\u201d distortion and boost confidence without demanding an all-at-once rewrite. A clear requirement that electors follow the certified results would further strengthen legitimacy, so disagreements stay about policy rather than the process.",
    "340": "Reform should keep the state-based structure that protects regional balance, but reduce the winner-take-all effect so outcomes better reflect how people actually vote in every state. A practical compromise is proportional or district-based allocation paired with clear, uniform rules for voter verification, paper-backed audits, and recounts, so close elections are easier to trust and harder to game. The goal is a system that rewards broad, cross-regional coalitions while giving voters in \u201csafe\u201d states and small communities a reason to believe their ballots still matter.",
    "734": "Reform should keep the Electoral College\u2019s job of making candidates earn support beyond the biggest cities, but it shouldn\u2019t run like a winner-take-all auction where a few swing states set the whole price. A practical fix is requiring proportional or district-based allocation of electoral votes, binding electors to the voters\u2019 decision, and adopting clear nationwide standards for audits, recounts, and ballot security so the outcome is trusted. Like rotating crops to keep a field healthy, these changes can preserve the federal balance while making more votes matter and lowering the temperature after close elections.",
    "45": "Presidential elections should produce outcomes that match the public\u2019s will while still giving every region a meaningful stake, the same way effective operations balance systemwide goals with local realities. A practical bridge is to move away from winner-take-all by adopting proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with ranked-choice voting so winners earn broad support. Whatever model is chosen, baseline national standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts would reduce chaos in close races and build trust across urban, suburban, and rural communities.",
    "495": "Presidential elections should be decided in a way that feels as fair and trustworthy as any high-stakes process: every lawful vote counted transparently, with clear standards for access, audits, and recounts that don\u2019t change by state or party.

The best bridge is keeping a state role but ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation nationwide, paired with uniform baseline standards for ballots, audits, and recounts so results are trusted and lawsuits don\u2019t become the tiebreaker. For those who want \u201cone person, one vote,\u201d a National Popular Vote compact\u2014ideally with ranked-choice to ensure a true majority\u2014offers a practical path without a rushed constitutional rewrite.

    "798": "Presidential elections should be decided in a way that feels fair to voters everywhere and is simple enough to explain without sounding like spin, which means reducing winner-take-all distortions while keeping state administration and clear, auditable rules. A practical bridge is adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with ranked-choice voting so the winner has majority support rather than a narrow, divisive edge.
