    "56": "Preserving the states' role while making each ballot carry more equal weight calls for practical, incremental reforms: adopt uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, and audits, end winner\u2011take\u2011all allocation in favor of proportional or district-based electors (or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact), and block faithless electors and partisan gerrymandering. Pairing these changes with options like ranked\u2011choice voting can encourage broader campaigning, reduce polarization, and rebuild public confidence without discarding the constitutional framework.",
    "698": "Preserving the federal balance while making every lawful vote feel meaningful is the practical aim, so reforms should be gradual, transparent, and stability\u2011focused rather than sweeping. Adopt uniform standards for ballot access, counting, and audits, and move states away from winner\u2011take\u2011all\u2014via proportional or district allocation or a phased interstate popular\u2011vote compact\u2014so smaller communities remain heard, swing\u2011state distortions shrink, and public trust in outcomes is restored.",
    "496": "Elections should make every lawful vote feel meaningful while preserving a role for smaller and rural communities, so practical, phased reforms\u2014like a national popular\u2011vote compact, proportional or district-based allocation of electors, and optional ranked\u2011choice ballots\u2014can bridge the divide. Pairing those changes with uniform standards for ballot access, transparent audits, and clear recount rules will build trust, encourage candidates to compete broadly, and help families and communities accept outcomes as fair.",
    "588": "Elections should be arranged like a well-tuned ensemble: rules that give every voter comparable weight while preserving a meaningful role for states will produce a more harmonious outcome. Practical, phased reforms\u2014such as interstate agreements to respect the national popular vote, proportional or district-based elector allocation, ranked-choice ballots where feasible, and uniform standards for counting and audits\u2014can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and rebuild public trust.",
    "144": "Elections should make every ballot feel meaningful while preserving the federal balance that ensures smaller and rural communities are heard. A practical path pairs phased reforms\u2014like proportional or district-based allocation of electors and support for an interstate popular\u2011vote mechanism\u2014with uniform standards for registration, ballot security, ranked\u2011choice options, and robust audits to rebuild trust. This mix reduces winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, encourages candidates to campaign nationwide, and helps outcomes more closely reflect the popular will without upending stability.",

A pragmatic reform package\u2014phasing in proportional or district-based elector allocation, pursuing an interstate popular-vote compact or ranked\u2011choice options where feasible, and enforcing uniform standards for ballot access, secure paper records, and robust audits\u2014would reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, encourage candidates to compete broadly, and rebuild public trust without tearing up the Constitution.",

A practical path is phased reform combining uniform national standards for ballot access, paper ballots, and audits with changes to how electors are awarded\u2014such as proportional or district allocation or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact paired with ranked\u2011choice voting and safeguards against faithless electors. The aim is to restore public trust, incentivize candidates to campaign broadly, and produce outcomes that are clear, fair, and widely accepted.",
    "370": "Elections should marry the fairness of one-person, one-vote with common-sense safeguards that keep smaller states and local communities meaningfully heard. A practical path is to phase in proportional or district-based allocation of electors while establishing uniform national standards for ballot access, security, and audits, and to consider interstate compacts or ranked-choice voting only with transparent, stable transitions. Clear, consistent rules will reduce winner-take-all distortions, encourage campaigning across the country, and rebuild trust in outcomes.",
    "320": "A sensible path modernizes presidential elections so every lawful vote carries comparable weight while preserving the federal balance that keeps smaller and rural communities heard. A phased mix of reforms\u2014interstate popular\u2011vote compacts or proportional/district allocation of electors, paired with ranked\u2011choice ballots where feasible and uniform standards for registration, paper\u2011backed voting, audits, and clear recount rules\u2014would reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, curb swing\u2011state domination, and rebuild public trust.

    "487": "A fair, trustworthy system should balance making every vote count with protections that keep smaller and rural communities heard; a practical path is to pair proportional or district allocation (or a National Popular Vote compact) with ranked\u2011choice voting, nonpartisan redistricting, uniform standards for ballot access, and robust audits. Reforms must be phased and transparent so busy families and working communities can trust outcomes and candidates are incentivized to campaign broadly rather than just in a few swing areas.",

Practical reforms\u2014such as phased adoption of a national popular-vote compact alongside proportional or district-based allocation, ranked-choice voting where feasible, and uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and faithless-elector safeguards\u2014can reduce winner-take-all distortions, encourage candidates to campaign broadly, and rebuild trust through transparent, predictable rules.",

A practical bridge balances state voices with equal-weight voting: pursue a national popular-vote solution implemented with phased safeguards (ranked-choice ballots, mandatory audits, and uniform certification standards) while allowing proportional or district-based allocation as an interim measure to reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and encourage nationwide campaigning.",
    "659": "A practical path preserves states' role while making votes more equal by phasing in proportional or district-based allocation of electors and supporting an interstate popular\u2011vote compact, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, secure paper backups, and routine audits. Such measured, transparent reforms would reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, protect smaller\u2011state voices, and rebuild public confidence without upending federalism. Prioritizing clear rules and accessibility rewards broad coalition\u2011building over narrow swing\u2011state strategies.",

Any change must be paired with uniform standards for ballot access, secure paper\u2011backed systems, independent redistricting, ranked\u2011choice options where helpful, and rigorous post\u2011election audits to build transparency and trust.
