    "417": "Election reform should ensure every lawful vote carries comparable weight while preserving a meaningful role for states through pragmatic, incremental changes that build trust rather than provoke upheaval. Pairing proportional or district-based allocation (or a carefully phased interstate popular\u2011vote compact) with ranked\u2011choice runoffs, uniform access standards, and secure, auditable paper trails would encourage broad campaigning, reduce swing\u2011state distortions, and make outcomes transparent and widely accepted.",
    "35": "Elections should make every vote feel equally meaningful while preserving the voice of smaller communities and the stability families rely on. A practical path combines proportional or district-based allocation (or an interstate popular-vote compact) with ranked-choice options and national baseline standards for access, counting, and audits so results are transparent, hard to game, and encourage candidates to campaign everywhere.",
    "140": "Stable, trustworthy presidential elections should preserve the role of states while making every ballot carry comparable weight, achieved through incremental reforms such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, secure audits, and clear recount rules. Implemented gradually with bipartisan safeguards, these measures would reduce swing-state distortions, encourage nationwide campaigning, and rebuild public confidence without upending federalism.",
    "752": "Stable, trusted presidential elections should make every ballot count while preserving the meaningful voice of states, so a phased, bipartisan path toward reforms\u2014like proportional or district-based allocation with anti\u2011gerrymandering safeguards and careful consideration of an interstate popular\u2011vote compact\u2014makes sense. Pairing those changes with uniform standards for ballot access, clear recount and audit rules, and optional ranked\u2011choice voting can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, encourage broad campaigning, and strengthen public confidence across urban and rural communities.",

A practical path forward pairs proportional or district-based elector allocation\u2014or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact\u2014with uniform standards for ballot access, mandatory paper trails, and routine post\u2011election audits so candidates must earn broad support and outcomes are transparent and verifiable.",
    "480": "Preserving the states\u2019 role while making every ballot feel equally meaningful is the most practical path: pursue an interstate compact or proportional allocation of electors alongside optional ranked\u2011choice voting, and set national baseline standards for ballot access, counting, and audits. Incremental, transparent reforms that reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and push candidates to campaign broadly across urban and rural communities can build trust, keep elections simple and secure, and help working families accept outcomes.",
    "160": "Practical reforms should make every vote carry similar weight while preserving states\u2019 meaningful role\u2014for example by moving away from winner\u2011take\u2011all toward proportional or district allocation, or by adopting an interstate compact that reflects the national popular vote. Any change must be paired with uniform, transparent standards\u2014secure paper trails, timely audits, clear recount rules, and protections against partisan gerrymandering\u2014so outcomes are trusted and candidates campaign broadly rather than concentrate on a few battlegrounds. Emphasizing clarity, stability, and broad bipartisan buy\u2011in can bridge fears on both sides and strengthen democratic legitimacy.",

These changes would reduce the outsized focus on a handful of swing states, encourage candidates to build broader coalitions, and make outcomes more transparent and harder to game while keeping states meaningfully involved.",
    "92": "Elections should be stitched together so every ballot holds equal weight while keeping states a meaningful part of the design, ensuring outcomes feel transparent and legitimate. Ending winner\u2011take\u2011all allocations in favor of proportional or district-based electors, paired with an interstate popular\u2011vote compact tied to uniform standards, ranked\u2011choice runoff options, and robust audits, would reduce swing\u2011state distortions, protect smaller communities, and rebuild public trust.",
    "433": "Preserve the state-based framework while moving outcomes closer to the national popular will through an interstate popular\u2011vote compact or proportional allocation of electors paired with ranked\u2011choice runoffs, so every ballot matters and candidates must build broad, cross\u2011country coalitions. Pairing that shift with uniform, nonpartisan standards for ballot access, mandatory paper trails, and routine audits will protect trust, prevent partisan gaming, and ensure smaller and rural communities retain a meaningful voice in a transparent, stable system that working families can rely on.",

A phased, bipartisan implementation with safeguards against gerrymandering, faithless electors, and inconsistent recounts offers a practical bridge that balances popular fairness with federal stability.",
    "273": "Preserving the federal role while making every ballot carry comparable weight should guide reform; a practical route is adoption of the National Popular Vote via an interstate compact or statewide proportional allocation of electors, paired with ranked\u2011choice runoffs and uniform standards for ballot access, counting, and audits.

This approach protects smaller and rural communities from being ignored, reduces winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, and strengthens public confidence without upending the Constitution. Clear, consistent rules that reward broad campaign engagement will help restore legitimacy and encourage candidates to earn support across the whole country.",
