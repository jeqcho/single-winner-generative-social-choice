    "409": "The Electoral College should be kept but modernized so outcomes more reliably reflect the national vote while still ensuring smaller and rural communities aren\u2019t written off. A practical middle path is ending winner-take-all by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation, paired with clear national standards for audits, recounts, and accessible voting options that are secure and easy to verify. That approach rewards broad coalitions, reduces \u201cswing-state\u201d games, and builds trust that the rules are fair even when the result is disappointing.",
    "444": "The presidential election system should reward broad nationwide support and treat each ballot with equal respect, while keeping elections practical, auditable, and hard to game. A workable middle path is to keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national baseline rules for access, counting, and automatic recounts in close races. That keeps smaller communities from being ignored, reduces swing-state distortions, and makes outcomes easier for most voters to recognize as legitimate.",
    "335": "The presidential election system should be modernized so outcomes align far more consistently with the national popular vote, while keeping a meaningful state role and clear, auditable rules that build confidence in close contests. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors nationwide or implementing a National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with uniform standards for ballot access, security, and recounts. Reforms should reward broad coalition-building and reduce \u201cswing state\u201d distortion without treating rural or smaller communities as an afterthought.",
    "486": "A presidential election should be simple enough for busy families to trust and fair enough that no voter feels ignored just because their state is \u201csafe.\u201d A practical bridge is to keep the state-run framework but reduce winner-take-all by moving toward proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national standards for counting, audits, and recounts. That approach respects smaller communities\u2019 voice while making results line up more closely with the votes people actually cast.",
    "121": "The Electoral College can be preserved for its state-based balance, but modernized so outcomes more reliably track the national will and fewer elections hinge on a handful of battleground states. A practical compromise would end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or adopting a carefully designed popular-vote compact), paired with clear national standards for audits, recounts, and ballot access to strengthen confidence. Reforms should be simple, auditable, and resistant to political gamesmanship\u2014much like any system where budgets, schedules, and public trust are on the line.",
    "466": "A presidential election system should be as testable and failure-resistant as good software: outcomes should track the votes, be auditable, and not hinge on a few edge-case states. The best bridge is to keep state administration but curb winner-take-all distortions through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear national baselines for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount triggers. That respects federalism and smaller-state concerns while making each ballot matter more equally and giving the winner a mandate most voters can recognize as legitimate.",
    "732": "A presidential election should be steady and understandable, where every lawful ballot carries real weight and no one feels invisible just because they live in the \u201cwrong\u201d state. A practical middle path is to keep the state-based structure but end winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally, or move toward the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once enough states join, so outcomes match the national will more closely without a sudden constitutional rupture. Whatever route is chosen should include clear nationwide standards for counting, audits, and recounts, with accessible voting options so trust can be rebuilt and close results don\u2019t leave people anxious and divided.",
    "325": "A presidential election should feel as straightforward as helping a customer find the right book: clear rules, the same respect for every voter, and an outcome people can explain without a civics degree. A practical bridge is keeping the state-run framework but ending winner-take-all through proportional electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, so candidates have to earn support beyond a few swing states and the popular vote almost always matches the result. Pairing that with baseline national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts protects trust for those who value stability and fairness alike.",
    "702": "A presidential election system should be as dependable and auditable as a preflight checklist: every lawful ballot should carry comparable weight, and the outcome should be easy to explain and verify. A practical bridge is to keep the constitutional framework while ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors or a National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear national standards for counting, audits, and recount triggers. That respects state roles and regional diversity while reducing swing-state distortion and making it far less likely that the popular-vote winner loses.",
    "109": "The presidential election should be updated so it\u2019s easier to explain, harder to game, and closer to the national popular will, while still giving every state a meaningful stake in the outcome. A practical bridge is keeping the Electoral College framework but ending winner\u2011take\u2011all through proportional allocation of electors (or a national popular vote compact), paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts. That combination would reduce swing\u2011state domination, encourage candidates to compete everywhere, and build the kind of trust that lets people get back to work and community life even after a close result.",
    "222": "Presidential elections should satisfy both \u201cone person, one vote\u201d legitimacy and the federal structure that gives states a meaningful role, because predictable, uniform rules are what make outcomes defensible when challenged. A practical reform would keep the Electoral College framework but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or implementing a National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers. That approach reduces swing\u2011state distortion, incentivizes nationwide campaigning, and strengthens public confidence without demanding an abrupt constitutional overhaul.",
    "646": "A presidential election should honor the simple idea that every lawful vote deserves equal weight, while also respecting the stabilizing role states play in administering elections and representing distinct communities. A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College framework but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, multilingual voter support, audits, and recounts. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would further encourage coalition-building and reduce the sense that a few swing areas\u2014or razor-thin pluralities\u2014decide everything.",
    "550": "Presidential elections should reward broad national support without making working communities in \u201csafe\u201d states feel like their votes don\u2019t matter, and the rules ought to be as clear and auditable as any safety plan on a job site. A practical middle ground is to keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or using the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it reaches the threshold), paired with uniform standards for audits, recounts, and deadlines. That approach respects federalism and rural concerns while making outcomes track the popular will more closely and lowering the temperature after close races.",
    "403": "A presidential election should translate votes into outcomes in a way that feels as fair and auditable as any high-stakes valuation, so public trust doesn\u2019t hinge on a handful of swing states. A practical bridge is to keep the state-run framework but curb winner-take-all by moving toward proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, recounts, and transparent audits. That approach respects smaller communities\u2019 desire to be heard while better aligning results with the overall popular will.",
    "280": "The presidential election should honor equality\u2014every lawful vote carrying similar weight\u2014while keeping states meaningfully invested so rural and urban communities both feel heard. A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College framework but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That combination would reduce \u201cswing-state\u201d politics, strengthen trust for families trying to teach kids that participation matters, and still reward candidates who build broad coalitions instead of chasing narrow margins.",
    "559": "Presidential elections should be run like any high-stakes project: clear requirements, consistent processes across states, and outcomes that match the real votes as closely as possible so trust isn\u2019t lost in the handoff. A practical bridge is to keep the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors\u2014or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it reaches a durable threshold\u2014paired with uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts. That approach preserves a meaningful role for states and smaller communities while reducing \u201cswing state\u201d distortions and making every lawful vote matter more.",
    "128": "Presidential elections should be decided in a way that\u2019s easy to audit, hard to game, and close enough to the national vote that the winner feels legitimate\u2014without pretending geography and state responsibilities don\u2019t matter. A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College framework but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional elector allocation or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national baselines for ballot access, counting, and automatic recounts. That combination would reduce swing\u2011state distortion, reward broad coalitions, and give voters in every state a reason to show up, even when the outcome stings.",
    "639": "The Electoral College should be kept as a federal framework, but modernized so outcomes more consistently track the national popular will and fewer elections hinge on a handful of swing states. A practical compromise is ending winner-take-all by encouraging proportional allocation of electors (or a carefully structured national popular vote compact) while setting clear, uniform national standards for voter access, audits, recounts, and elector accountability. Reforms should be simple, transparent, and secure\u2014rewarding broad coalitions across regions and restoring trust so communities can accept results and get back to the work of governing.",
    "666": "A legitimate presidential election should honor \u201cone person, one vote\u201d while still respecting the federal reality that states and diverse communities want assurance they will not be ignored. A practical bridge is to keep the constitutional framework but end winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors or adoption of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, multilingual voter information, audits, and recounts. These steps would reduce swing-state distortion, reward coalition-building across regions, and strengthen trust that the outcome reflects the electorate rather than electoral math.",
    "678": "A practical reform would keep states in the process but make outcomes track the nationwide vote more closely by ending winner-take-all allocations and moving toward proportional electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. Clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts would reduce distrust and the sense that a few swing states decide everything. Like good design that\u2019s built to last, the goal should be a transparent system that values every ballot while still rewarding candidates who earn broad, cross-regional support.",
    "160": "A presidential election should feel as straightforward and accurate as a receipt that balances: every lawful vote counted clearly, with rules that are consistent and easy to audit. A practical bridge is to keep the state-based structure but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, or adopt the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once enough states join, so outcomes match the national will more closely without making smaller states feel erased. Pairing either path with baseline national standards for ballot access, recounts, and transparent post-election audits would reduce \u201cswing state\u201d distortion and make it easier for people across parties to accept the result.",
    "725": "Presidential elections should be mission-ready: every lawful vote counted the same way, results auditable, and rules consistent across states so families and service members can trust the outcome even when it\u2019s close. The Electoral College can be kept but modernized by ending winner-take-all through proportional (or district-based) elector allocation, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, recounts, and security. A National Popular Vote Interstate Compact could serve as a disciplined, step-by-step bridge that better aligns outcomes with the popular will while preserving the role of states and the need for broad, nationwide coalitions.",
    "463": "A presidential election should be easy to trust and simple to explain, with every ballot carrying similar weight so people in \u201csafe\u201d states don\u2019t feel written off. A practical bridge is to keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally or through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national standards for accessible voting, transparent audits, and straightforward recount rules. That approach respects smaller-state concerns while making outcomes match the public\u2019s choice more reliably and lowering the temperature around close results.",
    "735": "El sistema para elegir al presidente debe sentirse justo y claro: que cuente el voto de la gente sin dejar que solo unos pocos estados \u201cbisagra\u201d decidan todo, pero tambi\u00e9n sin borrar la voz de comunidades peque\u00f1as. Un punto medio ser\u00eda mantener la estructura por estados y acabar con el \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d mediante una asignaci\u00f3n proporcional de electores, o avanzar con un acuerdo de voto popular nacional con reglas nacionales simples para auditor\u00edas, recuentos y certificaci\u00f3n. Con reglas transparentes y f\u00e1ciles de verificar, se fortalece la confianza y se obliga a los candidatos a buscar apoyo en m\u00e1s lugares, no solo donde les conviene.",
    "721": "Presidential elections should produce results that are easy to audit, hard to game, and broadly accepted, while still respecting the role states play in a federal system. A practical middle path would keep the Electoral College framework but end winner-take-all by encouraging proportional allocation of electors (or a carefully drafted National Popular Vote compact), paired with clear national baselines for chain-of-custody, recount triggers, and post\u2011election audits. That combination protects smaller-state concerns about being ignored while reducing \u201cswing state\u201d distortion and making outcomes track the will of voters more consistently.",
    "47": "Presidential elections should produce a result that is easy to explain in court and credible to people who care both about majority rule and about the federal role of states. A workable middle path is to keep the Electoral College\u2019s constitutional structure but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it reaches 270), paired with uniform national baselines for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers. That approach makes every lawful vote matter more, reduces \u201cswing-state\u201d distortions, and strengthens confidence that outcomes are secure, transparent, and legitimate.",
    "29": "El sistema para elegir al presidente deber\u00eda reflejar con m\u00e1s fidelidad el voto popular sin borrar la voz de los estados, porque la legitimidad se gana cuando cada papeleta pesa y el mapa no decide por unos pocos \u201cswing states\u201d. Un punto medio razonable es mantener la estructura estatal pero acabar con el \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d mediante asignaci\u00f3n proporcional de electores o avanzar con el National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, acompa\u00f1ado de est\u00e1ndares nacionales claros para acceso al voto, auditor\u00edas y recuentos. Tambi\u00e9n importa que el proceso sea sencillo, transparente y accesible \u2014incluyendo papeletas y asistencia en varios idiomas\u2014 para que familias y comunidades con distintas realidades puedan confiar en el resultado incluso cuando pierden.",
    "251": "A credible reform should honor the federal role of states while making it far less likely that the popular\u2011vote winner loses, since legitimacy depends on both broad national support and equal respect for each ballot. The most practical bridge is to keep the existing constitutional framework but end winner\u2011take\u2011all through proportional allocation of electors or adoption of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with baseline national standards for access, audits, and recounts. That combination reduces swing\u2011state distortion, encourages nationwide campaigning, and makes close outcomes easier for the public to accept.",
    "58": "A presidential election system should be as clear and fail-safe as an aircraft build: every lawful vote counted the same, with transparent audits and predictable recount rules that people can trust. A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework but curb winner-take-all\u2014through proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014so campaigns have incentives to compete everywhere and outcomes rarely diverge from the national vote. Pairing that with baseline national standards for ballot access, security, and certification protects personal freedom, strengthens legitimacy, and respects both rural and urban communities.",
    "173": "Un sistema para elegir al presidente debe ser f\u00e1cil de explicar a las familias, reflejar lo m\u00e1s posible el voto popular y, al mismo tiempo, dar confianza a comunidades peque\u00f1as de que no ser\u00e1n ignoradas. Un punto medio razonable es mantener el marco estatal pero terminar con el \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d mediante asignaci\u00f3n proporcional de electores o avanzar con el National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, acompa\u00f1ado de reglas nacionales claras para acceso al voto, recuentos y auditor\u00edas transparentes.

    "658": "Presidential elections should work like a safe warehouse operation: clear rules, consistent standards, and outcomes that match the real count, not a loophole in the process. A practical bridge is keeping the state-run structure but ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with uniform national baselines for access, audits, and recounts. That respects federalism and smaller-state concerns while making it far less likely that the popular-vote winner loses and reducing the \u201cswing state\u201d stranglehold on campaigns.",
    "435": "The Electoral College could be kept but re-engineered to reduce winner-take-all distortions that make most states feel irrelevant and occasionally produce outcomes at odds with the national vote. A practical bridge is wider adoption of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional elector allocation, paired with clear national baselines for ballot access, auditing, and automatic recount thresholds so results are transparent and verifiable. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would further reward broad coalitions and lower the temperature, while preserving the state-run administration many people see as a guardrail. This combination honors federalism and regional voice without treating \u201cone person, one vote\u201d as optional.",
    "401": "La presidencia deber\u00eda elegirse con un sistema que haga sentir que cada voto cuenta de manera m\u00e1s pareja, sin borrar el papel de los estados ni la preocupaci\u00f3n de las comunidades peque\u00f1as de quedar invisibles.

    "337": "Presidential elections should be simple, auditable, and reflect the will of the voters, not hinge on a handful of swing states or confusing winner-take-all math. A practical bridge is keeping the state-run framework but moving toward outcomes that track the national popular vote\u2014through proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, recounts, and security. That approach protects regional voices while making every ballot matter more evenly and giving people confidence the result wasn\u2019t gamed.",

    "333": "A presidential election system should be built like any dependable job: clear rules, solid checks, and results that line up with what people actually did. Keeping the state role can make sense, but winner-take-all rules should be replaced with proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact so fewer voters feel ignored and campaigns stop orbiting a handful of swing states. Any reform should come with straightforward national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the process stays secure, transparent, and easier for families to trust even when their side loses.",
    "138": "The Electoral College should be kept for the stability and state role it provides, but winner-take-all rules ought to be replaced with proportional allocation so close elections don\u2019t turn on a handful of counties while millions elsewhere feel ignored. If the goal is results people can trust, there should be clear national baseline standards for voter ID with workable alternatives, transparent audits, and uniform recount triggers so every lawful ballot is handled the same. A system that is simple, verifiable, and rewards broad support\u2014like a well-checked inspection line\u2014can protect smaller states without letting the popular will get sidelined.",

    "87": "A presidential election should be easy to explain to a civics student and feel fair to a retiree in any state: every lawful vote should matter, and outcomes should rarely contradict the nationwide choice. A workable bridge is to keep state-run elections while ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national baselines for access, audits, and recounts. That approach preserves the federal character many value while reducing swing\u2011state distortions and strengthening trust in close results.",
    "788": "A presidential election system should respect the federal balance that keeps smaller communities from getting steamrolled, while reducing the winner-take-all quirks that leave too many voters feeling ignored and breed distrust. A practical middle path is keeping the Electoral College but requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state, along with clear national standards for audits, recounts, and deadlines so the rules are consistent and easy to verify. That combination would push candidates to compete beyond a few battlegrounds and make outcomes line up more closely with the country\u2019s overall vote without forcing a risky, all-at-once rewrite.",
    "177": "Reforming the Electoral College should prioritize clear, consistent rules that the public can audit and trust, while reducing the \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions that make most voters feel irrelevant outside a few battleground states. A practical middle path is to keep state administration but require proportional allocation of electors\u2014or adopt the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it reaches a stable threshold\u2014paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, certification deadlines, and automatic recount triggers. That approach respects federalism and smaller-state concerns without tolerating outcomes that repeatedly diverge from the popular vote, and it rewards candidates who build broader coalitions across the whole country.",
    "490": "The Electoral College can be kept for stability and to respect the states, but the winner\u2011take\u2011all setup should be phased out so close elections reflect voters more accurately and don\u2019t hinge on a handful of battlegrounds. A practical compromise is proportional allocation of electors in every state, backed by clear national standards for voter ID with accessible alternatives, transparent audits, and automatic recount rules that are the same everywhere. That preserves federalism while moving closer to the common-sense idea that every lawful ballot should carry similar weight and be counted the same way.",
    "134": "A presidential election should be decided in a way that treats each ballot with equal dignity while still giving every state a reason to participate and be heard. A practical bridge is keeping the state-run system but ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear nationwide standards for access, audits, and recounts. That approach reduces swing-state distortions, improves legitimacy when outcomes are close, and keeps the rules simple enough that people across regions and parties can trust the result.",
    "196": "The presidency should be decided by rules that feel fair to everyday voters and are simple enough to explain at the kitchen table, especially when close races test everyone\u2019s patience and trust. A practical bridge is to keep the state-run framework but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, and pair that with clear national standards for audits, recounts, and ballot access so every lawful vote is handled the same. Over time, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a steady on-ramp toward outcomes that match the national vote without forcing an abrupt constitutional overhaul.",
    "81": "The presidential election should be run with the same insistence on accuracy, safety checks, and transparent audits that any high-stakes manufacturing process demands, while also honoring the reality that states and regions don\u2019t want to be politically erased.

That combination moves outcomes closer to the popular will, reduces \u201cswing state\u201d domination, and builds legitimacy without forcing an abrupt constitutional rupture.",
    "105": "Presidential elections should work like a good set of drawings: clear, auditable, and hard to game, so the winner is seen as legitimate even in a close year. Keeping the Electoral College framework can respect federalism and smaller-state concerns, but states should move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact) so the outcome tracks the national popular will more closely. Alongside that, uniform national baselines for voter ID options, chain-of-custody, audits, and recount triggers would raise confidence without shutting eligible voters out. This kind of measured modernization rewards broad coalitions and reduces the sense that a handful of swing counties decide everything.",
    "291": "Presidential elections should be decided in a way that feels as fair and evidence-based as a good treatment plan: every lawful vote should carry comparable weight, and the rules should be simple, auditable, and consistent across states. A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally, while also supporting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact so the national popular winner prevails once enough states join.

    "285": "A presidential election system should honor the simple civic lesson that participation matters by making outcomes track the national popular will more reliably, while still respecting states\u2019 roles and the reality of diverse communities. A practical bridge is keeping the constitutional framework but ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. Reforms should be easy to explain in a classroom and strong enough to build trust across rural, suburban, and urban voters.",
    "221": "A durable reform should preserve the state-based character that encourages broad coalitions while reducing the winner-take-all distortions that leave too many voters feeling irrelevant. Requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state\u2014paired with clear national standards for audits, recounts, and certification\u2014would better align outcomes with the popular vote without tearing up the constitutional framework.

    "592": "A presidential election system should be judged the way any large organization evaluates a decision framework: whether it produces outcomes that are legitimate, efficient, and resilient under stress, while giving voters a clear sense that participation matters everywhere. The most workable bridge is to keep state administration but end winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors nationwide, or achieve the same result via the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with uniform baseline standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would further ensure the winner reflects broad support and reduce the incentive to campaign only to narrow swing-state margins.",
    "670": "The Electoral College should be kept in its constitutional role but modernized so outcomes track the voters more closely and campaigns stop treating most states as spectators. A practical compromise is ending winner-take-all by encouraging proportional allocation of electors (or a carefully designed interstate compact) alongside clear national baselines for audits, recounts, and ballot handling so the process is consistent and trusted. That approach preserves federal balance and regional voices while respecting the common-sense expectation that every lawful vote should carry similar weight.",
    "76": "Presidential elections should honor both equal treatment of each voter and the reality that different states and communities want to feel heard, especially when trust is already fragile. A practical bridge is to keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, or achieve the same result through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, so outcomes align more closely with the nationwide vote. Paired with clear national baseline standards for accessible ballots, transparent audits, and consistent recount rules, these reforms can reduce \u201cswing state\u201d distortion and strengthen legitimacy for everyone.",
    "37": "Reform should preserve the federal balance that keeps candidates paying attention to smaller states and rural communities, while reducing the frustration that comes when the national popular vote and the outcome don\u2019t match.
