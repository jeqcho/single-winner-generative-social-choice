Uniform, transparent standards for ballot access, paper backups, and post\u2011election audits should accompany any change to build trust and encourage campaigns to compete nationwide rather than only in a handful of swing states.",
    "532": "Preserve the constitutional role of states while addressing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions so every lawful vote carries more equal weight; a pragmatic path is phased reforms\u2014such as proportional or district allocation of electors and conditional adoption of an interstate popular\u2011vote compact\u2014only after clear, uniform standards and audit safeguards are agreed. Strengthening transparent, paper\u2011backed voting, timely recount rules, and nonpartisan administration will protect smaller communities and build broad trust so outcomes are accepted without upheaval.",
    "334": "A practical, detail-oriented path forward preserves the federal balance that ensures smaller communities are heard while making every lawful vote carry comparable weight. Phased reforms\u2014such as proportional allocation or an interstate popular-vote compact alongside ranked\u2011choice ballots, uniform standards for access, and robust audits and recount rules\u2014would reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, reward broad coalition\u2011building, and restore confidence in outcomes.",
    "755": "Elections should make every ballot carry comparable weight while keeping states and local communities meaningfully heard. Practical reforms\u2014like proportional or district-based allocation of electors, ranked-choice voting, or a national popular vote compact\u2014must be paired with uniform access rules, transparent counts, and robust audits to build trust. That balanced path reduces swing\u2011state distortion, rewards broad coalition\u2011building, and protects smaller communities within the federalist framework.",
    "451": "Elections should be straightforward to teach, trusted by families and communities, and structured so every ballot carries comparable weight while preserving a meaningful role for states.

    "89": "Elections should ensure every lawful vote carries comparable weight while preserving the federal principle that smaller and rural communities remain heard. A pragmatic reform path pairs uniform national standards for access, counting, and audits with measures like proportional allocation of electors, the National Popular Vote compact, or ranked\u2011choice voting implemented gradually to reduce swing\u2011state distortion and build broad trust.",
    "517": "A fair reform should make every vote carry comparable weight while preserving meaningful state voices and community representation. Practical steps\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors or a National Popular Vote compact paired with ranked\u2011choice ballots, uniform voting standards, paper backups, and routine audits\u2014would reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, encourage candidates to campaign broadly, and rebuild public confidence. Phased implementation with clear public education would help build bipartisan trust and ease the transition.",
    "322": "Sound reform should reconcile equal weight for individual votes with the federalist role of states by phasing out winner\u2011take\u2011all allocations in favor of proportional or district-based electors and creating a clear pathway\u2014such as an interstate compact or a national popular tally with ranked\u2011choice voting\u2014to ensure broad, legitimate mandates. Pairing any allocation change with uniform, evidence\u2011based standards for ballot access, paper backups, and rigorous post\u2011election audits will protect integrity and build public confidence. Changes should be incremental and empirically tested so bipartisan buy\u2011in and stability grow alongside fairness.",

    "415": "A practical reform agenda should maximize one-person-one-vote parity while preserving federalist safeguards that keep smaller and rural communities politically relevant. A phased package\u2014using an interstate compact to implement the national popular vote or mandatory proportional allocation of electors, combined with ranked\u2011choice ballots, uniform nationwide standards for ballot access, paper backups, and mandatory post\u2011election audits\u2014will reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, discourage swing\u2011state exclusivity, and make outcomes more transparent and resilient.",

Practical, phased steps\u2014such as a national popular vote compact or proportional allocation of electors paired with ranked\u2011choice ballots, uniform access standards, and robust audits\u2014can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, encourage broader coalition\u2011building, and rebuild public trust. Those changes must be transparent, nonpartisan, and protective of smaller communities so the system feels fair to voters everywhere.",
    "184": "A durable reform should balance one-person\u2011one\u2011vote with meaningful state voices by ending winner\u2011take\u2011all allocation in favor of proportional or district-based electors and pursuing a phased move toward a national popular tally or interstate compact with ranked\u2011choice options. Paired with uniform voting standards, paper backups, and mandatory post\u2011election audits, these practical, transparent steps would preserve federalism while encouraging broad coalition\u2011building and restoring public trust.",
    "242": "Electoral reforms ought to preserve the federal balance that keeps smaller communities relevant while ensuring every lawful vote carries comparable weight and that outcomes are transparent and auditable. A practical, phased approach\u2014encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors, enabling an interstate compact to reflect the national popular vote only after uniform standards, paper backups, robust post\u2011election audits, and optional ranked\u2011choice ballots are in place\u2014can reduce swing\u2011state distortion, reward broad coalition\u2011building, and rebuild public confidence.",
    "204": "Like a well-crafted recipe, election reform should blend respect for state voices with steps that make every ballot carry comparable weight\u2014practical measures could include a national popular vote (or interstate compact), proportional allocation of electors, and ranked\u2011choice options where feasible. Clear, uniform standards for access, paper backups, audits, and nonpartisan administration will rebuild trust across urban and rural communities and encourage campaigns to compete broadly rather than focus on a handful of swing states.",
    "35": "A reliable presidential election system should make every lawful vote carry similar weight while preserving the meaningful voice of states and smaller communities and protecting family and community stability. Practical reforms\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors, a carefully enacted interstate popular\u2011vote compact with safeguards, ranked\u2011choice options, and uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts\u2014can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions without upending federalism, build cross\u2011partisan trust, and encourage candidates to campaign across the whole country.",

Uniform standards for access, bilingual outreach, paper backups, and robust post\u2011election audits would rebuild trust, broaden participation, and force campaigns to compete nationwide instead of concentrating on a handful of swing states.",
    "467": "Practical, commonsense reforms should make every vote carry comparable weight while preserving the federal balance that protects smaller and rural communities; a workable compromise is to move away from winner\u2011take\u2011all toward proportional or district allocation of electors and to adopt a national popular\u2011vote compact only with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. Emphasis on accessibility for elderly and disabled voters, straightforward rules (such as binding electors and exploring ranked\u2011choice ballots), and transparent administration can rebuild trust and encourage candidates to campaign broadly rather than only in a few battlegrounds.",
    "455": "Elections should make every lawful ballot carry comparable weight while preserving meaningful state and local voices; a practical path is adopting a national popular vote or proportional allocation of electors, combined with ranked\u2011choice ballots and uniform standards for access, counting, and audits.

Phased, commonsense reforms that respect federalism and one\u2011person\u2011one\u2011vote principles can bring communities together and reward broad coalition\u2011building.",
    "110": "Like a careful restoration, reforms should be gradual, clearly explained, and aimed at making every ballot meaningful while preserving a role for states so small communities are not ignored. Pairing measures that better align outcomes with the popular vote\u2014such as an interstate compact, proportional allocation, or ranked\u2011choice counting\u2014with uniform standards for access, paper backups, and post\u2011election audits would reduce swing\u2011state distortion, build trust, and reward broad, coalition\u2011building campaigns.",
    "192": "Practical reform should preserve the federalist role of states while making every ballot carry roughly equal weight by moving away from winner\u2011take\u2011all allocations toward proportional or district\u2011based elector distribution, or by adopting an interstate compact that honors the national popular vote. Pairing that change with ranked\u2011choice ballots, uniform nonpartisan standards for voting access, paper\u2011backed records, and rigorous post\u2011election audits will reduce swing\u2011state distortions, encourage broad coalition\u2011building, and rebuild public confidence in outcomes.",
    "299": "Experience in people-centered healthcare administration shows voting systems must be clear, accessible, and trusted. A practical reform would preserve states' meaningful role while making every ballot more equal\u2014for example through proportional allocation of electors or a thoughtfully designed interstate compact toward a national popular outcome\u2014paired with ranked\u2011choice options, uniform voting standards, paper backups, and routine audits to protect access and confidence. This blend reduces swing\u2011state distortion, rewards broad coalition\u2011building, and helps communities across the country accept results as legitimate.",

Implementing change gradually with clear, transparent rules and civic education will build trust, encourage campaigning beyond a few battlegrounds, and keep the system understandable and stable for neighborhoods and local economies.",
    "441": "A sensible path is to tend the electoral system like a well-kept garden\u2014honoring the states' role and the stability they provide while ensuring every ballot carries comparable weight and is counted transparently. Practical reforms\u2014such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors, a carefully phased interstate popular\u2011vote compact or ranked\u2011choice voting, paired with uniform standards, strong audits, and improved access for seniors and people with disabilities\u2014can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, encourage nationwide campaigning, and build broader, bipartisan trust.",
    "308": "Elections should make every lawful vote feel meaningful while keeping communities of all sizes heard, so reforms must reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and strengthen transparency, uniform access rules, and routine audits.

    "126": "Stable, trustworthy presidential elections require that every lawful vote carry similar weight while preserving the voice of smaller communities and the federal framework that binds them. Modest, practical reforms\u2014such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors, or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact implemented alongside uniform standards, paper backups, and routine audits\u2014can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, simplify outcomes, and build the clear, reliable rules needed for public confidence.",
    "211": "Elections should be stable, predictable, and transparent while ensuring every lawful vote carries comparable weight and the constitutional role of states is respected. A practical compromise would preserve the state\u2011based framework but reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions through proportional or district allocation of electors, a carefully phased interstate popular\u2011vote compact, adoption of ranked\u2011choice options where appropriate, and uniform nationwide standards for ballot access, paper backups, and post\u2011election audits. Those measures balance fairness with continuity, encouraging broad campaigning and public trust without erasing smaller states\u2019 voice.",
    "493": "Elections should make each ballot carry comparable weight while preserving the states\u2019 meaningful role, so modernization must balance federalism with one\u2011person\u2011one\u2011vote fairness.

    "132": "A fair presidential system should make every lawful vote carry comparable weight while preserving the federalist role of states\u2014achieved pragmatically through proportional allocation of electors, the National Popular Vote compact once broadly adopted, or ranked\u2011choice voting that rewards broad coalitions rather than narrow geographic swings. Clear, uniform standards for ballot access, paper backups, audits, and nonpartisan administration are essential to build trust across urban and rural communities and to keep rules simple, enforceable, and resilient so families and local economies can rely on predictable outcomes.",
    "419": "Trustworthy elections require clear, stable rules that both protect smaller states\u2019 voice and make every lawful vote carry comparable weight.

A pragmatic path pairs proportional or district-based allocation and ranked-choice voting with a National Popular Vote compact only after uniform standards, accessible procedures, and strong post\u2011election audits are in place so smaller places still matter and outcomes are widely trusted. Practical, transparent safeguards that improve access for disabled and rural voters will encourage candidates to campaign broadly and help restore confidence in the system.",

Requiring uniform baseline standards for access, paper ballots, transparent audits, and clear recount rules would protect disabled and low\u2011income voters, rebuild trust, and ensure outcomes reflect broad national support without erasing local voices. Phased, transparent implementation with bipartisan safeguards can help these changes be seen as fairness reforms rather than partisan advantages.",
