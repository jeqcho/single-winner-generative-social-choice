    "382": "A better presidential election should make outcomes track the national popular will more closely while keeping states meaningfully involved in running elections and protecting regional voices. Practical reforms\u2014like ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014can reduce swing-state distortions without requiring an overnight constitutional overhaul. Whatever model is chosen should include clear, uniform standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts so the rules are easy to understand, hard to game, and trusted even when results are close.",
    "300": "The Electoral College should be kept as a guardrail for smaller states, but the winner-take-all setup in most states ought to be replaced with proportional or district-based allocation so fewer votes feel \u201cwasted\u201d and campaigns can\u2019t ignore whole regions. Trust would also improve with clear, uniform rules for ballot access, accessibility, recounts, and post-election audits, plus firm limits on faithless electors. That kind of reform respects tradition and local voice while better matching outcomes to how the country actually votes.",
    "342": "Reforming the Electoral College should focus on fairness, clarity, and trust by reducing winner-take-all distortions so fewer voters feel ignored and fewer elections hinge on a handful of swing counties. A practical bridge is to keep states administering elections but move toward outcomes that track the national popular will more closely\u2014through proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with uniform standards for audits, recounts, and elector accountability. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would help ensure majority-backed winners and lower the temperature by rewarding broader coalitions instead of narrow geographic strategies.",
    "574": "The Electoral College should be kept as a federal guardrail, but the winner-take-all approach in most states ought to be replaced with proportional or district-based allocation so fewer voters feel written off and campaigns have a reason to show up everywhere. Clear, uniform standards for ballot handling, audits, and recount triggers\u2014along with firm rules against faithless electors\u2014would strengthen confidence that outcomes are earned, not gamed. A careful, step-by-step approach can honor constitutional tradition while better matching results to the public\u2019s vote and lowering the temperature after close elections.",
    "747": "Reforming the Electoral College should keep elections stable and state-run while making the outcome track the national popular will more closely, so fewer voters feel ignored in \u201csafe\u201d states and campaigns stop obsessing over a handful of battlegrounds. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional elector allocation nationwide or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once enough states join. Pairing either approach with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform standards for audits, recounts, and elector compliance would boost legitimacy and make it easier for people across regions to accept the result.",
    "353": "The Electoral College should be kept to preserve the idea that states and smaller communities matter, but it needs updating so the outcome tracks voters more closely and doesn\u2019t turn a few battlegrounds into the whole election. A practical compromise is ending winner-take-all by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation, while requiring electors to follow certified results and adopting clear, uniform standards for ballot security, audits, and recounts. That keeps tradition and stability, but makes every vote feel less \u201cwasted\u201d and easier to trust\u2014no matter which party wins.",
    "16": "The Electoral College can be treated like critical infrastructure: keep the state-based architecture, but eliminate winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, binding electors to certified results, and adopting uniform national standards for audits, recount triggers, and ballot security. Pairing that with a National Popular Vote Interstate Compact backstop would better align outcomes with the national will while preserving federal balance and reducing single-point failures that fuel distrust. The objective is a transparent, verifiable process that pushes campaigns to compete everywhere\u2014not just in a few swing states\u2014so results are broadly legitimate even when the margin is tight.",
    "494": "The Electoral College can be kept as a guardrail for states and smaller communities, but it should be modernized so the outcome tracks the voters more closely and fewer people feel ignored in \u201csafe\u201d states. A practical compromise is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, binding electors to certified results, and adding clear nationwide standards for accessibility, audits, and recounts so results are trusted. That approach respects tradition and local voice while honoring the simple idea that every lawful vote should matter about the same\u2014porque la confianza y la unidad importan m\u00e1s que la pelea.",
    "463": "The Electoral College should be updated so the winner more consistently matches the national popular vote, while keeping states\u2019 role in running elections and ensuring smaller communities aren\u2019t treated like an afterthought. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with ranked-choice voting so the president is backed by a broader majority. Whatever the model, there should be clear, uniform national standards for accessibility, audits, and recounts so every vote is counted the same and the outcome is easier to trust.",
    "441": "The Electoral College can be kept as a guardrail that respects states and smaller communities, but it should be repaired so the result tracks the people\u2019s vote more closely and feels honest and calm to accept. States could be required to bind electors to certified results and move away from winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally, paired with clear national baselines for accessibility, paper-backed audits, and recounts in close races. That kind of careful reform honors tradition while reducing swing-state games and strengthening trust that every lawful ballot is counted fairly.",
    "7": "Electing a president should reflect the national popular will while still ensuring rural and small-state communities aren\u2019t treated like flyover afterthoughts, especially when land, water, and conservation policy hit locally first. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by moving to proportional electors nationwide, with strong paper-trail audits, clear recount triggers, and rules that bind electors to certified results. Pairing that with ranked-choice voting would reward coalition-building and reduce spoiler fears, helping more Americans trust the outcome even when their side loses.",
    "648": "The Electoral College should be kept but updated so results track the national will more closely and fewer voters feel written off in \u201csafe\u201d states. A practical compromise is proportional allocation of electors in every state, firm rules that bind electors to certified results, and clear nationwide standards for accessible voting, audits, and recounts so close elections don\u2019t turn into chaos. That keeps the state-based structure many value while making the outcome feel fair, understandable, and easier for communities to accept even when their preferred candidate loses.",
    "334": "Electoral College reform should make outcomes track the national popular will more closely while preserving the states\u2019 role and avoiding rules that can be gamed or misunderstood. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation (or a popular-vote compact), paired with ranked-choice voting so the winner earns broader support and \u201cspoiler\u201d dynamics are reduced. Whatever model is chosen should include uniform, transparent national standards for ballot access, audits, recount thresholds, and binding electors to certified results, so families and working communities can trust the process even when their side loses.",
    "311": "Presidential elections work best when they reward the will of the most voters while still reassuring smaller communities that they will not be brushed aside. A steady, practical reform would keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by moving to proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national standards for audits, recounts, and binding electors to certified results. That kind of adjustment makes outcomes easier to accept, reduces the swing-state obsession, and keeps the rules simple enough to teach and trust.",
    "45": "Presidential elections work best when outcomes track the national popular will while preserving the states\u2019 role in administering secure, trusted contests, much like any high-stakes system that must coordinate across departments and still deliver a clear result. A practical bridge is to reduce winner-take-all distortions through proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with uniform national standards for audits, recount thresholds, and protections against faithless electors. Adding ranked-choice voting can ensure the winner earns broad support and lower the sense that a handful of swing counties decide everything.",
    "49": "The best reform keeps states running elections but makes the presidency track the national popular will more closely, so the outcome feels legit whether someone lives in a deep-blue or deep-red place. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional electoral vote allocation (or the National Popular Vote compact once it\u2019s broad enough), paired with ranked-choice voting so winners earn real majority support. To keep things tight and trusted, electors should be bound to certified results and every state should follow clear baseline rules for access, audits, and recounts\u2014clean, consistent, and harder to game.",
    "453": "Reforming the Electoral College should aim for outcomes that track the national popular will more closely while keeping elections administrable, auditable, and trusted across states and communities. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once enough states join), paired with uniform standards for ballot access, post-election audits, and clear recount triggers. Those changes would reduce swing-state distortions, make more voters matter in every state, and strengthen legitimacy without forcing an abrupt constitutional rupture.",
    "791": "Reform should keep the states\u2019 role in running elections but make the outcome track the national popular will more closely so fewer voters feel invisible in \u201csafe\u201d states and fewer races hinge on a handful of battleground counties. A practical bridge is proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with binding electors, clear automatic recount and audit standards, and strong baseline protections for voting access and ballot security. That mix respects concerns about regional voice while honoring the common-sense expectation that the candidate with the most support should win.",
    "128": "A presidential election system should reward the national popular will while keeping the rules clear, auditable, and consistent across states so close races don\u2019t turn into chaos or litigation. A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College framework but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and binding electors to certified results, paired with uniform standards for access, paper trails, and automatic recount thresholds. If that still leaves outcomes regularly misaligned with the country\u2019s vote, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact offers a lawful next step that preserves state administration while making every ballot matter in every state.",
    "336": "A practical reform would keep the state-based structure but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, binding electors to certified results, and adding clear nationwide standards for audits and recounts so outcomes are verifiable and harder to game. That approach respects federalism and local control while making the result track the popular will more closely and reducing the unhealthy obsession with a few swing states. If trust and reliability improve under those rules, a national popular-vote compact becomes a cleaner next step without forcing an all-at-once constitutional overhaul.",
    "127": "The best path is to keep states administering elections but make the presidential outcome track the national popular will more closely, either through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or by requiring proportional allocation of electors instead of winner-take-all. Pairing that with ranked-choice voting, enforceable rules against faithless electors, and clear national standards for accessibility, audits, and recounts would make the system fairer, easier to trust, and less dominated by a handful of swing states. That approach respects federalism and rural concerns while honoring the basic civic lesson that every ballot should carry meaningful weight.",
    "806": "Reform should keep the state-based structure that encourages broad, nationwide support, while dialing back winner-take-all rules that make too many voters feel ignored and turn a few battlegrounds into the whole election. A practical middle ground is proportional or district-based allocation of electors paired with clear national baselines for audits, recounts, and ballot security, plus firm rules that electors follow certified results. That preserves federalism and local voice without losing sight of the common-sense standard that the outcome should track the people\u2019s vote and be straightforward to verify.",
    "676": "The Electoral College doesn\u2019t need a full demolition, but it does need a cleaner, code-compliant rebuild so outcomes track the voters more closely and campaigns stop treating most states like closed job sites. A solid middle-ground is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based) elector allocation, locking electors to certified results, and setting uniform national standards for audits and recount triggers so close races don\u2019t turn into chaos. That keeps states in the driver\u2019s seat while honoring the common-sense rule that the candidate with the broadest support should win.",
    "647": "Presidential elections should be designed like a reliable system: simple rules, consistent standards across states, strong audits, and outcomes that track the will of voters closely enough that losing sides can still trust the result. A practical bridge is to keep state-run administration but end winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation of electors nationwide, while also binding electors to certified results and improving accessibility for voters with disabilities. If broader change is needed, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as an orderly path toward a popular-vote outcome without abrupt constitutional disruption. This combination preserves a meaningful role for states while making more votes matter in every state, not just a handful of battlegrounds.",
    "569": "A workable reform should keep the state-based structure people trust while making outcomes track the national vote more closely, so fewer voters feel erased by winner-take-all rules and campaigns have reason to show up everywhere. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, recounts, and binding electors to certified results\u2014offers a steady, practical bridge between federalism and \u201cone person, one vote.\u201d With transparent rules and reliable procedures, the focus can shift from fighting over election mechanics to the everyday civic work of serving communities and protecting peaceful transfers of power.",
    "295": "A sensible reform would keep states administering elections while ensuring the presidency tracks the national popular will more closely\u2014either through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or by ending winner-take-all with proportional elector allocation. Pairing that with uniform, transparent standards for ballot access, post-election audits, and automatic recount thresholds would strengthen trust and reduce the sense that a few swing states decide everything. Candidates would still need broad, cross-regional appeal, but every voter\u2019s ballot would carry more equal weight and the outcome would be easier to accept, win or lose.",
    "307": "A workable reform should keep the state-based structure that forces candidates to earn geographically broad support, while reducing winner-take-all distortions that make millions of lawful votes feel irrelevant and turn a few battlegrounds into the whole contest. Requiring proportional (or district-based with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) allocation of electors, binding electors to certified results, and adopting uniform national standards for voter ID, paper trails, audits, and recount thresholds would improve fairness and reliability without inviting endless disputes. The goal is a system that is simple to verify, hard to game, and legitimate enough that communities of every size can accept the outcome even when their side loses.",
    "343": "The Electoral College should be kept as a federal guardrail, but the winner-take-all setup needs to be rebuilt so results track voters more honestly and campaigns can\u2019t ignore most states. A workable compromise is proportional allocation of electors in every state, binding electors to certified results, and clear nationwide standards for voter ID, audits, and recount triggers so outcomes are straightforward to verify. That approach respects smaller-state influence while answering the basic expectation that the candidate with the broadest support\u2014across the country, not just a few battlegrounds\u2014should win.",
    "779": "The system for choosing a president should be fair enough that people in every state feel their vote truly matters, not just those living in a few battleground places. A practical reform is to keep the state-run structure but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional elector allocation or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national standards for accessible voting, audits, and recounts that work for people with disabilities and busy families. That balance respects local communities and stability while making outcomes match the country\u2019s actual choice more often, so trust is easier to rebuild even when the result disappoints.",
    "633": "A good reform should respect the role of states and smaller communities while making sure the winner matches the voters as closely as possible, so elections don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re decided by a few swing places. A practical middle ground is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional electoral vote allocation in every state, along with clear national standards for counting, audits, and recounts so families can trust the result. If a bigger change is needed, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can move the country toward the popular will without a sudden rewrite of the whole system.",
    "268": "The Electoral College can be kept as a federal guardrail, but its winner-take-all distortions should be reduced so outcomes track the popular will more closely and fewer voters feel ignored in \u201csafe\u201d states. A workable compromise is proportional or district-based allocation of electors paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, post-election audits, and mandatory elector adherence to certified results. Reforms should be incremental, transparent, and focused on restoring trust\u2014so campaigns have incentives to compete broadly across the country while protecting smaller communities from being drowned out.",
    "533": "The Electoral College should be kept to preserve the state-by-state balance, but the winner-take-all setup ought to be replaced with proportional or district-based elector allocation so fewer votes get wasted and fewer elections hinge on a handful of swing counties. Uniform, no-nonsense rules for audits, recount thresholds, and elector faithfulness would make outcomes easier to verify and accept. That kind of reform respects tradition and local voice while better matching results to what voters actually chose.",
    "144": "A workable reform should make presidential elections track the national popular will more closely while keeping states central to administering elections and ensuring smaller communities aren\u2019t treated like flyover stops. The cleanest bridge is a national popular vote outcome\u2014via an interstate compact or a constitutional amendment\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting and uniform audit/recount standards so close races don\u2019t hinge on a few counties or arcane technicalities. If full replacement remains out of reach, requiring proportional allocation of electors and binding electors to certified results would reduce winner-take-all distortions and boost trust across the map. Ultimately, the goal is simple: every ballot should matter, campaigns should have reasons to show up everywhere, and the rules should be clear enough that people can accept the result and move on.",
    "286": "The Electoral College should be kept as a state-based framework but updated so outcomes track the national popular will more closely and fewer voters feel invisible in \u201csafe\u201d states. A practical bridge is nationwide proportional allocation of electors (or a National Popular Vote compact as an on-ramp), paired with enforceable rules against faithless electors and clear, uniform standards for audits, recounts, and ballot access so results are trusted. This approach preserves federal balance while honoring the simple democratic expectation that the candidate with the most support should win.",
    "775": "A sensible reform should make presidential outcomes track the national popular will more closely while keeping elections auditable, predictable, and hard to game. The most workable bridge is to end winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with uniform standards for accessibility, paper trails, and post-election audits so voters in every state can trust the count. Adding ranked-choice voting would help ensure the winner has broad support, reducing spoiler fears and encouraging candidates to compete beyond a handful of battlegrounds.",
    "514": "The Electoral College should be kept as a federal safeguard, but the winner-take-all setup in most states ought to be replaced with proportional or district-based allocation so fewer voters feel written off and campaigns have to compete in more places. Any update should come with clear, uniform rules for voter ID, ballot handling, audits, and automatic recount triggers, and electors should be required to follow certified results. That kind of practical, tighten-the-bolts reform respects tradition and local voice while making outcomes feel fairer and easier to trust.",
    "760": "Electoral College reform should prioritize legitimacy and predictable, litigation-resistant rules while respecting that states administer elections and many communities worry about being ignored. A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation (or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once sufficient states join), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, post-election audits, recount thresholds, and binding electors to certified results. That combination makes outcomes track the popular will more closely, reduces swing-state distortion, and strengthens trust without requiring an immediate constitutional overhaul.",
    "669": "Presidential elections should reward the candidate who earns the most support from voters nationwide while keeping clear, consistent rules that people in every state can trust. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally or through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with strong audits, clear recount triggers, and rules that bind electors to certified results. That way, candidates have incentives to compete beyond a handful of swing states, and more families can feel that every ballot truly matters.",
    "727": "A strong reform would make presidential elections track the national popular vote more closely while keeping states central to running elections, such as adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or requiring proportional allocation of electors instead of winner-take-all. Pairing that with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform standards for access, audits, and recounts would protect fairness and legitimacy while easing fears that any one region or a handful of swing states can dominate. The common goal should be a system where every ballot matters, outcomes are predictable and verifiable, and civic trust is strong enough to model in classrooms and communities.",
    "318": "The presidential election system should make every ballot feel like it matters, not just votes in a few swing states, while still respecting that states and smaller communities want a real voice in the process. A practical middle ground is to keep the Electoral College but require proportional allocation of electors (ending winner-take-all), lock in rules that prevent faithless electors, and adopt clear nationwide standards for audits and recounts so close results are trusted. If that proves too slow politically, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a bridge toward aligning outcomes with the national popular will without a sudden constitutional overhaul.",
    "501": "Presidential elections should feel like good service: clear rules, fair treatment, and a result that matches what most people asked for, not just what happened in a few swing spots. A practical bridge is keeping state-run elections but ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with uniform access, audits, and recount standards so the process is easy to trust. Adding ranked-choice voting would help ensure the winner has broad support and reduce the \u201cspoiler\u201d fights that keep people angry after close races.",
    "89": "A sensible reform would keep states central to administering elections but make presidential outcomes track the national popular will more closely by ending winner-take-all allocations through proportional electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with a clear rule that electors must follow certified results. National baseline standards for ballot access, multilingual support, post-election audits, and automatic recount thresholds would strengthen trust and reduce the sense that only a few swing states matter. Blending fairness with reliability can help more communities accept results, lower polarization, and better align the system with social justice and equal political voice.",
    "147": "Reform should keep the state-run structure people trust while making the outcome track the national popular will more reliably, so elections don\u2019t hinge on a few battleground counties or the quirks of winner-take-all rules. A workable bridge is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or universal proportional allocation of electors, paired with ranked-choice voting to ensure majority-backed winners and reduce \u201cspoiler\u201d fears. Whatever path is chosen should include clear national baseline standards for access, transparent audits, and automatic recount rules so results are credible, teachable, and easier to accept across regions.",
    "183": "Reform should keep the state-based framework people trust while making outcomes track the national popular will more closely, so elections aren\u2019t decided by a handful of swing counties. A practical bridge is expanding the House to reduce distortions, ending winner-take-all with proportional elector allocation (or using the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), and requiring electors to follow certified results. Pairing any change with clear national standards for access, paper-trail audits, and automatic recount thresholds can strengthen legitimacy for both voters focused on equal voice and those focused on protecting smaller communities.",
    "576": "Un sistema presidencial gana legitimidad cuando se acerca m\u00e1s al voto popular sin borrar el papel de los estados, reduciendo el \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d con una asignaci\u00f3n proporcional de electores o un acuerdo tipo National Popular Vote que obligue a competir en todos lados, no solo en pocos estados. Para cuidar la confianza de quienes temen que las ciudades dominen y de quienes exigen \u201cun voto, un valor\u201d, hacen falta reglas nacionales claras: auditor\u00edas transparentes, recuentos autom\u00e1ticos en elecciones cerradas y electores obligados a respetar el resultado certificado. Tambi\u00e9n debe garantizarse acceso real al voto para personas con discapacidades y en varios idiomas, porque la democracia solo funciona cuando todos pueden participar con dignidad.",
    "707": "The Electoral College should be updated so presidential outcomes track the national popular will more closely, while keeping a meaningful state role that reassures smaller and rural communities they won\u2019t be ignored.

    "198": "Reform should keep the state-based structure but make outcomes track the national popular will more closely, much like a well-engineered system where inputs and outputs align without surprise failure modes. A practical bridge is proportional allocation of electors (or a National Popular Vote compact once enough states join), paired with clear national standards for audits, recount thresholds, and elector accountability so results are secure and broadly accepted. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would reduce spoiler fears and push candidates to build wider coalitions beyond a handful of battleground states.",
    "270": "Reform should keep states meaningfully involved while making presidential outcomes track the national popular will more closely, since trust rises when people can see a clear link between ballots cast and results delivered. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with uniform baseline standards for access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers in close elections. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would help produce majority-supported winners and lower the \u201cspoiler\u201d anxiety that fuels polarization.",
    "61": "Reforms should make presidential elections feel straightforward and fair to everyday voters by tying results more closely to the national popular vote, while keeping states in charge of running elections and protecting smaller communities from being ignored. A practical bridge is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear nationwide baseline standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts so outcomes are trusted even in close races. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would also reduce spoiler fears and encourage candidates to earn broader, more civil support beyond a handful of battleground states.",
    "210": "The Electoral College should be kept as a stable, familiar structure, but modified so outcomes track the national vote more closely and fewer voters feel ignored in \u201csafe\u201d states. A practical compromise is proportional allocation of electors in every state, binding electors to certified results, and clear nationwide standards for audits, recounts, and ballot access so working families can trust the count.

    "309": "A durable reform would keep states administering elections while making the presidency track the national popular will more closely\u2014either through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or by ending winner-take-all with proportional elector allocation. Pairing that shift with modern, uniform standards for accessibility, paper-backed audits, and clear recount triggers would improve reliability and public trust without erasing smaller states\u2019 voices. The point is to reduce \u201cswing-state roulette,\u201d make every ballot matter in every state, and deliver outcomes that more Americans can accept even when their side loses.",
    "495": "Presidential elections should reflect the national popular will while keeping a meaningful role for states, because legitimacy depends on both \u201cone person, one vote\u201d and confidence that smaller communities won\u2019t be written off.

    "455": "A sensible reform should honor the country\u2019s state-based system while making the outcome line up more reliably with the voters, so elections don\u2019t hinge on a handful of battleground counties. A practical bridge is to move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), pair it with ranked-choice voting to ensure a true majority, and set clear national standards for audits, recounts, and elector accountability. That approach protects rural and small-state concerns about being ignored while respecting the basic fairness of one person, one vote and lowering the temperature around close results.",
    "640": "The Electoral College should be modernized so outcomes track the national popular will more closely while keeping states meaningfully involved and smaller communities from feeling erased.

A practical bridge is moving toward the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform accessibility standards, paper trails, and transparent post-election audits so results are trusted in every community.

    "704": "A durable reform would keep elections administered by the states but make the outcome track the national popular will more closely, reducing winner-take-all distortions that leave \u201csafe-state\u201d voters feeling invisible and campaigns obsessed with a few battlegrounds. The most workable bridge is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with ranked-choice voting and clear nationwide standards for audits, recounts, and elector binding so results are transparent and hard to game. That combination respects concerns about regional voice while honoring the core democratic expectation that the candidate supported by the most voters should win.",
    "260": "Reforms to the Electoral College should respect the country\u2019s state-by-state tradition while reducing the winner-take-all distortions that make most voters\u2014and most places\u2014feel ignored. A practical bridge is proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with clear, uniform standards for paper trails, audits, and recounts so close results are verifiable and accepted. If broader change is desired, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact offers a step toward aligning outcomes with the national vote without forcing an abrupt constitutional overhaul.",
    "76": "Reforms should keep the stability of a state-run system while making results track the voters more closely, so fewer people feel like their ballot is \u201cwasted\u201d in winner-take-all states. A practical bridge is proportional allocation of electors nationwide or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with uniform standards for accessibility, paper trails, audits, and clear recount rules so outcomes are trusted and workable for all voters, including those with disabilities. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would help ensure the winner earns broad support and reduce the fear of spoilers, encouraging campaigns to compete beyond a handful of swing states.",
    "14": "A workable reform would keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform, transparent standards for audits, recount triggers, and ballot handling so the outcome is easier to verify and accept. This preserves federalism and limits big-metro dominance while making more votes matter in every state, not just a few battlegrounds. Locking electors to the certified result and keeping rules simple and consistent would reduce gamesmanship and improve trust without demanding a sudden constitutional overhaul.",
    "225": "Reform should keep the state-based structure that reassures smaller and rural communities while making presidential outcomes track the national popular will more closely, so fewer voters feel erased by winner-take-all rules.

Whatever the model, shared guardrails\u2014uniform access standards, transparent audits, and clear recount triggers\u2014can strengthen trust and lower the temperature by making the process easier to understand and harder to game.",
    "663": "The Electoral College should be kept as a federal safeguard, but reformed so outcomes track voters more honestly and don\u2019t hinge on a handful of swing states. States should move away from winner-take-all toward proportional or district-based allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering rules, and electors should be required to follow certified results. Alongside that, clear nationwide standards for ballot security, transparent audits, and consistent recount triggers can strengthen trust so families can accept results peacefully\u2014even when their preferred candidate loses.",
    "182": "The Electoral College does not have to be scrapped to fix what frustrates people; it can be rebuilt so outcomes track voters more closely while keeping states and smaller communities from being ignored. Requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation instead of winner-take-all, binding electors to certified results, and setting clear nationwide standards for voter ID, audits, and automatic recounts in close races would make the system harder to game and easier to trust. The point is a straightforward set of rules that rewards broad support across the country, not narrow wins in a handful of battleground counties.",
    "160": "The presidential election system should be updated so outcomes track the national vote more closely while keeping a meaningful role for states, since trust depends on rules that are simple, consistent, and hard to game. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national standards for audits, recounts, and binding electors to certified results. That approach respects concerns about smaller communities being heard while reducing the sense that a few swing counties decide everything.",
