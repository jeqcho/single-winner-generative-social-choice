    "743": "The Electoral College should be retained to preserve the federal balance, but reformed to reduce winner-take-all distortions so fewer Americans feel written off in \u201csafe\u201d states. A practical compromise would be proportional allocation of electors within each state, paired with clear national standards for recounts, auditing, and elector binding to strengthen confidence and acceptance of close results. This approach keeps smaller communities from being ignored while bringing outcomes closer to the popular will and lowering the temperature around presidential elections.",
    "5": "A presidential election should feel fair to voters everywhere, not just in a few swing states, while still honoring the reality that states and local communities run elections and don\u2019t want to be erased. A practical bridge is to keep state administration but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once broad buy-in exists. Pairing either approach with clear national standards for counting, recounts, and elector rules would boost trust, reduce chaos in close races, and make campaigns compete for support in every region.",
    "136": "Presidential elections should be simple to understand, hard to game, and fair enough that people in both big cities and small towns feel their vote mattered. A practical middle ground is keeping the state-run framework but ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, with uniform national standards for counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races. If broader buy-in develops over time, a National Popular Vote compact could serve as a clean backstop that respects the popular will while avoiding constant constitutional fights.",
    "736": "Presidential elections work best when the outcome is easy to explain, feels fair in every community, and doesn\u2019t turn a handful of swing states into the only places that matter. A practical bridge is to move toward honoring the national popular vote through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, while ending winner-take-all by encouraging proportional allocation and adding clear, uniform national standards for counting, recounts, and elector binding. Pairing that with ranked-choice voting would reduce spoiler fears and reward broader coalitions, helping more voters accept the result even when it isn\u2019t their preferred outcome.",
    "616": "Presidential elections should be as transparent and consistently administered as any set of financial records, and they should make every ballot feel worth the effort to cast\u2014no matter the state. A practical bridge is moving toward a national popular vote through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, while also ending winner-take-all by encouraging proportional allocation of electors and adopting clear national standards for counting, audits, and recounts. That combination respects federalism and smaller-state concerns while reducing swing-state distortion and making outcomes easier for the public to trust.",
    "129": "Reform should keep the state-based structure that reassures smaller communities, but reduce winner-take-all so the result tracks the popular will more closely\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors or a carefully defined national popular-vote compact. Clear, uniform rules for counting, audits, and recounts would make close elections easier to trust and harder to game. Like a well-run kitchen under pressure, the system should be simple, consistent, and built to earn acceptance even from those who don\u2019t like the outcome.",
    "494": "Presidential elections should be simple to understand, hard to game, and trusted by both small communities and big cities, so reforms ought to keep states involved while reducing the winner-take-all feeling that makes many voters feel ignored. A workable middle ground is proportional allocation of electoral votes within each state, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot security, audits, and recounts, plus a firm rule that electors must follow the voters. That approach respects federalism and local voice while making the result track the public will more closely, strengthening legitimacy and unity.",
    "453": "Replacing winner-take-all with proportional allocation of electors would make more ballots matter in every state while still honoring the federal structure that many communities trust. A practical bridge is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers, so close races are verifiable and losers can accept the result. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would encourage broader, less polarizing coalitions and make campaigning about earning support everywhere, not just a few swing counties.",
    "471": "Reform should keep the state-based structure that helps smaller communities feel represented, while reducing the winner-take-all distortions that make many voters in \u201csafe\u201d states feel written off. A practical middle ground is proportional allocation of electors in every state, paired with clear national standards for audits, recounts, and elector faithfulness so results are timely, transparent, and trusted. If broader change is needed, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be a phased path that honors majority rule without abruptly discarding federalism.",
    "302": "Presidential elections should reflect the national will while remaining understandable, stable, and respectful of the states\u2019 role in administering elections. A practical bridge is to curb winner-take-all by moving toward proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close contests are trusted. Adding ranked-choice voting in presidential contests would reduce spoiler fears and reward coalition-building, encouraging candidates to engage voters beyond a handful of swing states.",
    "636": "The Electoral College should be kept for the sake of stability and the idea that every state matters, but it needs tightening so outcomes track the voters more closely and don\u2019t hinge on a handful of swing counties. A workable middle ground is to require electors to follow the state vote, end winner-take-all by moving to proportional (or district-based) allocation, and set clear national standards for audits, recounts, and deadlines so the results are straightforward to verify. That approach respects rural and small-state voices while reducing resentment from voters in \u201csafe\u201d states and lowering the temperature after close elections.",
    "111": "Electoral College reform should preserve the federal balance that keeps smaller states from being ignored while reducing winner-take-all distortions that make too many voters in \u201csafe\u201d states feel written off. A practical middle path is proportional allocation of electors in every state, paired with clear national standards for ballot security, audits, and recount triggers, and firm rules binding electors to the certified popular vote. If broader change is pursued, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a carefully tested bridge\u2014implemented only with transparent safeguards\u2014so the outcome is both widely accepted and hard to game.",
    "157": "Presidential elections should honor the simple idea that the candidate with the most votes wins, while keeping the process transparent and stable enough that people in every state trust the result. A practical bridge is to move toward a national popular vote through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear national standards for counting, recounts, and enforceable rules against faithless electors. Reforms like ranked-choice voting and a modest expansion of House seats can reduce winner-take-all distortions and encourage broader coalition-building, so campaigns compete beyond a handful of swing states.",
    "696": "Presidential elections should honor the democratic instinct that every vote ought to carry equal weight, while also respecting the federal reality that smaller and rural communities want reassurance they will not be ignored. A practical bridge is to move toward a national popular vote through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, recounts, and elector obligations to reduce suspicion and legal chaos. Adding ranked-choice voting or an automatic runoff would encourage broader coalitions and make the winner feel more legitimate, strengthening civic trust and a shared commitment to justice and equality.",
    "455": "Presidential elections should feel fair and straightforward, where every lawful vote matters and no community\u2014big city or small town\u2014gets taken for granted. A practical, trust-building path is to move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and adopting clear national standards for counting, audits, and recounts, while states continue to run elections. If broader agreement develops, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be a steady bridge toward aligning the outcome with the national popular will without ripping up the whole system overnight.",
    "386": "The Electoral College should be kept for its federal purpose, but the winner\u2011take\u2011all habit and inconsistent state rules have put too much power in a few battlegrounds and too little confidence in close outcomes. A practical reform is to require electors to follow the state popular vote, encourage proportional allocation of electoral votes, and set clear national standards for audits and recounts so results are timely and trusted. That approach protects smaller-state voices while making campaigns compete for voters everywhere, not just where the map happens to be tight.",
    "639": "The Electoral College should be kept for its role in encouraging broad, cross-state support, but the winner-take-all approach in most states deserves reform so fewer voters feel written off. A workable middle ground is proportional allocation of electors within each state, paired with clear national standards for audits, recount triggers, and elector compliance to raise trust and reduce post\u2011election chaos. If the country ever moves to a national popular vote, it should be phased in with enforceable, uniform rules and an automatic runoff or ranked-choice option so the winner has a clear mandate and every community still gets meaningful attention.",
    "710": "A sensible reform should keep the state-based framework that protects smaller communities from being steamrolled, while reducing the winner\u2011take\u2011all distortion that makes millions of votes feel pointless and pushes campaigns into a handful of swing states. Allocating electoral votes proportionally within states, requiring electors to follow the voters, and setting clear national standards for ballot security, audits, and recounts would make outcomes easier to trust without ripping up the Constitution overnight. The goal is a system that\u2019s straightforward, verifiable, and rewards broad support across the country, not just smart map\u2011gaming.",
    "286": "Presidential elections should be easier to accept as legitimate when they track the national popular will, yet still leave room for states and smaller communities to feel meaningfully included. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, strengthen rules that bind electors to the certified vote, and adopt clear nationwide standards for recounts and ballot access. If broader agreement emerges, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as an orderly bridge toward a system where every vote carries the same weight and campaigns have reason to compete everywhere, not just in a few battlegrounds.",
    "21": "Presidential elections should feel like a shared national moment where every vote counts the same, not a strategy game focused on a few swing states, and the rules should be clear enough that people trust the outcome even when their side loses. The best bridge is moving toward a national popular vote through an interstate compact, while also ending winner-take-all by encouraging proportional allocation of electors and adding consistent national standards for counting, recounts, and elector accountability. Pairing that with ranked-choice voting would reward broad coalitions, lower the \u201cspoiler\u201d fear, and push candidates to campaign everywhere\u2014not just where the map tells them to.",
    "723": "Presidential elections should be as clear and trustworthy as any system people rely on in a crisis: every lawful vote counted consistently, with transparent audits and uniform recount triggers that reduce chaos and suspicion. A practical bridge is to keep state-run administration while ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors, and to pair that with a path toward honoring the national popular vote through a broadly supported interstate compact. Ranked-choice voting or a runoff backstop can help ensure the winner earns broad support, while preserving confidence that rural and small-state communities will not be ignored.",
    "282": "A presidential election should honor the principle that every vote counts while keeping faith with the federal role states play in holding a diverse country together. A practical bridge is to curb winner\u2011take\u2011all by moving toward proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts so results are transparent and trusted. The aim should be less swing\u2011state roulette and more incentive for candidates to listen to communities everywhere, strengthening legitimacy without dismissing small\u2011state and rural concerns.",
    "432": "Presidential elections should be easy to understand, accessible to voters with disabilities, and fair enough that a ballot counts the same whether it\u2019s cast in a \u201csafe\u201d state or a swing one. A practical bridge is keeping state-run elections while ending winner-take-all through proportional electoral-vote allocation, paired with clear national standards for voting access, audits, and recounts to build trust. If broader consensus is possible, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014ideally paired with ranked-choice voting\u2014can move the country toward a result that matches the popular will while still encouraging candidates to compete across regions.",
    "810": "The Electoral College should be kept for the way it protects smaller states and rural communities from being drowned out, but it needs reforms that make the result feel fair and easy to trust. States should end winner-take-all by moving to a proportional or district-based allocation, require electors to follow the voters, and adopt clear national standards for recounts, audits, and ballot security. That approach preserves the federal balance while giving more people a reason to believe their vote matters, even in places that usually get ignored.",
    "242": "A credible reform should make presidential outcomes track the national popular will more closely while keeping states meaningfully involved in administration and certification. The most practical bridge is ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors (and/or a carefully designed National Popular Vote compact), paired with clear nationwide standards for audits, recount triggers, and elector binding so results are transparent and hard to game. That combination would reduce swing\u2011state distortion, preserve regional buy-in, and strengthen trust that public decisions are being made with consistent, data-verifiable rules.",
    "32": "Reform should keep the state-based framework that protects smaller communities from being drowned out, while reducing the winner-take-all distortion that makes millions of votes feel wasted and fuels distrust. A practical middle path is proportional allocation of electors in every state, firm rules that bind electors to the voters\u2019 result, and clear nationwide standards for audits and recounts so outcomes are verifiable and accepted. If broader change is ever pursued, it should be phased in with simple rules and broad buy-in, so stability for working families matters as much as fairness.",
    "107": "Replacing the winner-take-all approach with proportional allocation of electoral votes, paired with clear national standards for counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers, would make outcomes feel more consistent and defensible without stripping states of their role. If the country wants the presidency to track the popular will more directly, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact offers an incremental path, especially if combined with ranked-choice voting to reduce spoiler fears. The common ground is a system that is easy to explain, hard to game, and rewards broad, nationwide support rather than a narrow focus on a few swing states.",
    "114": "A presidential election should feel like a well-kept building: transparent, consistently maintained, and fair to every resident, so reforms should reduce winner-take-all distortions while preserving a meaningful role for states. A practical bridge is expanding adoption of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close races are trusted. Adding ranked-choice voting would encourage broader coalitions and reduce the sense that only a few swing areas get attention.",
    "672": "Presidential elections should feel fair and understandable to busy families, with every lawful vote carrying meaningful weight and results that are transparent enough to earn acceptance even in close races. A practical compromise is to keep state-run elections but curb winner-take-all by moving toward proportional electoral vote allocation or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national standards for counting, audits, and recount triggers. That combination respects regional voices while reducing swing-state distortions and rebuilding trust that the outcome reflects what voters intended.",
    "130": "Presidential elections should honor the basic idea that every voter\u2019s choice carries similar weight, while still recognizing that a country of very different states and communities needs leaders with broad, cross-regional support. A practical bridge is to phase toward a national popular vote through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so results are trusted and easy to explain. Adding ranked-choice voting or an automatic runoff can reduce spoiler fears and encourage coalition-building, lowering the temperature so campaigns engage more than just a handful of swing states.",
    "737": "Presidential elections should be simple to understand, hard to game, and fair enough that a vote carries similar weight whether it\u2019s cast in a rural county or a major metro area, so campaigns stop treating most states like flyover territory. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (with electors bound to the results), while moving toward a national popular-vote outcome through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once broad buy-in exists. Pairing any change with uniform recount triggers, auditable paper trails, and updated voting technology would raise confidence across parties and better support long-term civic stability and environmental stewardship.",
    "24": "Presidential elections work best when the rules are simple, honest, and easy to trust, so hard-working families feel every lawful vote matters and the result is accepted. A practical reform would keep the state role but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, require electors to follow the voters, and set clear national standards for counting, audits, and recounts. That approach respects smaller communities while reducing swing-state games and bringing outcomes closer to the will of the people.",
    "703": "Presidential elections should be run like any system that people have to trust at scale: transparent, auditable, and consistent, with outcomes that track the voters\u2019 will instead of hinging on a handful of swing states. A practical bridge is to move toward a national popular-vote result through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact while keeping state-run administration, paired with clear national standards for counting and recounts and a ranked-choice ballot to ensure broad support. If that feels too abrupt, states can still reduce winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and requiring electors to follow the vote, so rural and urban communities alike know their ballots matter.",
    "172": "A presidential election system should be easy to explain, reflect the popular will, and still give every region confidence it won\u2019t be written off, since legitimacy matters as much as the winner. A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once broad buy-in exists), paired with clear national standards for access, counting, audits, and recounts so close races don\u2019t turn into prolonged conflict. Adding ranked-choice voting where feasible would encourage broader, less polarizing coalitions and reduce the sense that only a few swing places matter.",
    "500": "Replacing winner-take-all rules with proportional allocation of electoral votes would make more ballots matter in every state while keeping a meaningful role for states and regions. A practical bridge is to pair that shift with clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers, so results are easier to trust and accept. If broader change gains consensus, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014ideally alongside ranked-choice voting\u2014offers a phased path toward honoring the popular will without sudden disruption.",
    "288": "A presidential election system should feel as fair and trustworthy as any high\u2011stakes process: clear rules, consistent standards, and outcomes that match what voters intended, not what geography happened to reward. A practical bridge is to keep state-run administration but end winner\u2011take\u2011all by requiring proportional allocation of electors or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with uniform national standards for ballots, audits, and recounts. That approach protects smaller communities from being ignored while ensuring every vote carries more equal weight and reducing the sense that only a few swing states matter.",
    "182": "Presidential elections should be easy to understand, hard to game, and trusted by people in both small towns and big metros, with consistent rules for counting, audits, and recounts so results feel solid. Rather than scrapping the Electoral College overnight, states could move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and requiring electors to follow the voters, which would make more ballots matter while keeping a role for states. If confidence grows, a broader national popular-vote approach could be phased in with clear safeguards so the winner reflects broad support without leaving rural communities feeling written off.",
    "516": "Presidential elections should be understandable, trusted, and feel fair to voters in every state, which means reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and aligning outcomes more closely with the national popular will while keeping states meaningfully involved in administration. A practical bridge is proportional allocation of electors nationwide\u2014or adoption of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for counting, audits, and recounts so close races don\u2019t spiral into litigation. Adding ranked-choice voting where feasible would reward broader coalitions and lower the stakes of narrow geographic strategies, helping both urban and rural communities feel heard.",
    "465": "Presidential elections should be clear, trustworthy, and worthy of acceptance on the toughest nights, balancing the instinct for \u201cone person, one vote\u201d with the concern that smaller and rural communities not be written off. A practical reform is to keep the state-based structure but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform national standards for counting, audits, and recount triggers, and binding electors to the certified result. Over time, broader consensus could justify a national popular-vote approach, but only with the same kind of transparent safeguards that make any high-stakes system reliable.",
    "379": "The Electoral College should be kept for the balance it gives smaller states, but the winner\u2011take\u2011all setup needs reform so fewer voters feel written off in \u201csafe\u201d states. A practical middle ground is requiring electors to follow the state result and allocating electoral votes proportionally, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot handling, audits, and recounts so outcomes are simple to verify and harder to game. That approach respects local community voice while making the final result track more closely with how people actually voted.",
    "166": "The Electoral College should be reformed to make presidential elections feel fair and straightforward to working people, while still keeping states from being steamrolled by a few major metro areas. A practical middle ground is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors and binding electors to the state result, paired with clear national standards for counting, audits, and recount triggers so close races don\u2019t turn into chaos. If that still fails to match the country\u2019s overall choice, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact offers a phased way to honor the popular will without a sudden constitutional overhaul.",
    "506": "Presidential elections should feel like good branding: transparent rules, an outcome that matches what most people chose, and a reason for candidates to show up everywhere\u2014not just a few swing markets. A practical bridge is keeping state-run administration but ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation, while building toward a national popular-vote guarantee via the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. Pairing that with clear nationwide standards for recounts, ballot access, and elector binding would protect trust, reduce courtroom chaos, and make every community\u2019s votes harder to ignore.",
    "735": "El sistema debe ser claro y justo: que cada voto pese m\u00e1s y que las campa\u00f1as no solo busquen a unos cuantos \u201cswing states,\u201d pero sin dejar que las comunidades peque\u00f1as queden en el olvido. Un buen punto medio es mantener el papel de los estados y terminar con el \u201cwinner\u2011take\u2011all\u201d usando reparto proporcional de electores, junto con reglas nacionales simples para conteo, auditor\u00edas y recuentos, para que el resultado sea confiable. Si con el tiempo se busca un cambio mayor, un camino gradual como un acuerdo de voto popular nacional con salvaguardas ayudar\u00eda a que el ganador tenga legitimidad y que, como se dice, \u201ccuentas claras, amistades largas.\u201d",
    "746": "The Electoral College can be preserved for its federal balance, but it should be modernized so outcomes more consistently match the public\u2019s vote and so campaigns have reason to compete beyond a handful of swing states. A practical compromise is to end winner\u2011take\u2011all by moving states toward proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear national standards for counting, recounts, and auditable election security, and firm rules binding electors to the certified results. Changes should be incremental, transparent, and built to earn broad trust so the losing side can accept the result and the country can move on.",
    "585": "Presidential elections should feel like good service: clear rules, consistent standards, and an outcome that matches what most voters chose, not just the luck of a few swing-state tables. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, paired with uniform national rules for access, audits, and recounts, plus binding electors to the results. If broader consensus grows, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can further align the presidency with the national popular vote while still requiring candidates to earn support across the whole country.",
    "559": "A durable reform should make the presidential outcome track the national popular will more closely while keeping the process transparent, auditable, and easy for families to understand. A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional allocation of electors and pairing that with uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, and automatic recount triggers in razor-thin races. If broader consensus develops, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a phased path toward a popular-vote result without abrupt disruption to state-run administration.",
    "666": "Presidential elections should better honor the principle that each ballot carries equal weight while preserving the stabilizing role states play in administering elections and representing distinct communities. A practical bridge is to reduce winner-take-all distortions through proportional allocation of electors or adoption of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with ranked-choice voting to reward broad, coalition-building candidates. Whatever model prevails, uniform national standards for ballot access, transparent audits, and clear recount triggers would strengthen legitimacy and lower the temperature around close results.",
    "215": "A durable reform should bring presidential outcomes closer to the national popular will while keeping elections state-run and governed by clear, uniform rules for access, counting, audits, and recounts to limit litigation and restore public confidence. The most practical bridge is ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors\u2014or, where politically feasible, using the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact with enforceable elector-binding\u2014so voters in \u201csafe\u201d states matter and campaigns must build broad coalitions. Pairing either approach with ranked-choice voting would reduce spoiler dynamics and reward candidates who can earn majority support across regions.",
    "811": "A durable reform should honor the federal structure that knits diverse regions together while reducing the recurring legitimacy crisis created when the national popular vote and the presidency diverge. The clearest bridge is to end winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional allocation of electors (or a widely adopted national popular-vote compact), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, recounts, and binding electors to the voters\u2019 choice. Such a package would make more ballots meaningful in every state, lessen swing-state distortion, and promote broad coalition-building without forcing an abrupt constitutional rupture.",
    "151": "Presidential elections should be easy to understand, hard to manipulate, and worthy of trust, so every lawful vote is counted with the same clear standards while communities in smaller and rural states are not brushed aside. A practical bridge is to keep the state-based structure but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and requiring electors to follow the voters, with uniform nationwide rules for audits, recounts, and timely certification. If broader agreement grows, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a careful step toward matching the national result to the people\u2019s choice without inviting chaos.",
    "145": "The Electoral College can be kept for its federal balance, but it should be modernized so outcomes track more closely with how people actually vote and so campaigns are not just about a handful of swing states. A practical compromise is ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear national standards for voter verification, audits, and recount triggers so results are simple to follow and hard to dispute. That approach respects smaller communities while treating every lawful ballot as meaningful, strengthening trust in the process and the peaceful transfer of power.",
    "202": "Presidential elections should reflect the national popular will while keeping the process clear, verifiable, and respectful of the states that administer it. A practical bridge is to phase in the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or require proportional allocation of electors to end winner-take-all distortions, paired with uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers so results are trusted. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would reduce spoiler fears and reward coalition-building, helping campaigns compete beyond a handful of swing states.",
    "248": "Presidential elections should be run with the same emphasis placed on safety, transparency, and consistent standards in high-stakes public systems, so outcomes are widely trusted and every ballot feels meaningful beyond a handful of swing states. A practical bridge is to keep state administration but end winner-take-all by moving to proportional elector allocation and binding electors to the vote, with clear national baselines for access, auditing, and recounts. If broader agreement develops, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting\u2014can better align results with the popular will while still encouraging candidates to earn support across diverse regions.",
    "245": "Presidential elections should be designed so every vote carries comparable weight and the outcome is easy to explain, audit, and accept, not dominated by winner-take-all math in a few swing states. A practical bridge is moving toward a national popular-vote result through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact while also encouraging proportional allocation of electors and uniform national standards for ballot access, recount triggers, and transparent audits. Pairing that with ranked-choice voting would reduce spoiler fears and push candidates to build broader coalitions, so rural, urban, and \u201csafe-state\u201d voters alike feel seen.",
    "720": "Presidential elections should stay grounded in the Constitution while giving voters confidence that the winner reflects broad support and that no community\u2014rural or urban\u2014gets written off. A practical reform is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by encouraging proportional allocation of electors, require electors to follow the state vote, and adopt clear national standards for counting, audits, and recounts. That combination respects federalism and traditional stability while reducing \u201cswing-state\u201d distortions and making outcomes easier to accept, even when the result stings.",
    "698": "A stable election system should respect the Constitution and the role of states, but it should also reduce the \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d feeling that makes many lawful votes seem wasted and turns the whole contest into a few swing places. A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College while requiring electors to follow the state vote, using proportional allocation within states, and setting clear national standards for counting, audits, and recounts so results are trusted. If the country later moves toward a national popular vote through a careful, widely accepted process, it should include simple rules that encourage broad coalitions and avoid constant legal fights.",
    "670": "Reform should keep the Electoral College\u2019s federal-state balance while reducing winner-take-all distortions that make too many voters feel written off, especially outside a handful of swing states. A practical middle ground is proportional allocation of electors within each state, with a clear national baseline for voter verification, auditable counting, and automatic recount triggers in close races so results are trusted and timely. If broader change is desired, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be a phased option, but only with transparent, consistent rules that protect both rural and urban communities and keep the process simple enough for families to understand and accept.",
    "315": "Presidential elections should be easy to understand, consistently administered, and fair enough that people in both \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cswing\u201d states feel their votes matter. A practical bridge is to keep states running elections but reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all by allocating electoral votes proportionally (with electors bound to the result), while also adopting clear national standards for recounts, accessible ballots, and transparent auditing. Over time, broader buy\u2011in for a national popular vote through an interstate compact could further align outcomes with the will of the most voters without dismissing concerns about smaller communities being overlooked.",
    "226": "Presidential elections should feel fair and easy to explain, so votes matter the same whether they come from a packed city block or a small town, not just a few swing states. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electoral votes proportionally or through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once enough states join. Pairing either approach with clear national standards for counting, recounts, and ballot access would lower the temperature, boost trust, and make candidates compete for every community\u2019s support.",
    "240": "Reform should preserve the Electoral College\u2019s federalist aim of requiring broad, cross-regional support while reducing winner-take-all distortions that make too many voters feel written off. A pragmatic path is for states to allocate electors proportionally and bind electors to the state result, paired with clear nationwide standards for audits, recount triggers, and chain-of-custody so close outcomes are credible.

A practical reform is to keep the state-based system while requiring electors to follow the statewide vote, setting clear national rules for counting and recounts, and encouraging states to allocate electors proportionally so outcomes track the popular will more closely. Any change should be simple, secure, and easy to trust, so working families can accept the result and move on.",
