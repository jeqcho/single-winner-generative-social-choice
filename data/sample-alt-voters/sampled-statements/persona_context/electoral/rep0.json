    "379": "Elections should make every lawful vote carry comparable weight while preserving the state-based balance that encourages candidates to earn support across a diverse country. A practical compromise is to modernize the current framework with proportional or district allocation of electors, adoption of an interstate compact to reflect the national popular vote when broadly joined, and uniform standards for ballot access, paper audits, recounts, and optional ranked\u2011choice voting to improve legitimacy and reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions.",

    "564": "Elections should ensure every vote carries comparable weight while preserving a meaningful role for states so smaller communities remain heard. A practical bridge is to retain the Electoral College\u2019s state\u2011based framework but move toward proportional allocation or a national popular\u2011vote compact paired with ranked\u2011choice voting and uniform, auditable standards for ballot access and recounts. Incremental, transparent reforms will reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions and build confidence across diverse communities.",
    "543": "Elections should make every lawful vote feel equally meaningful while preserving the role of states in a diverse republic. Practical reforms\u2014like clearer national standards for ballot access and audits, proportional or district-based allocation of electors, and voluntary paths toward a national popular vote with ranked\u2011choice safeguards\u2014can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions without discarding federalism. Implementing changes incrementally with transparent rules will build trust and encourage candidates to earn support across the whole country.",

Pairing those steps with uniform standards for voter access, secure paper ballots, and routine transparent audits\u2014along with voluntary interstate compacts or ranked\u2011choice options\u2014can rebuild confidence and encourage candidates to earn broad, cross\u2011country support.",

Uniform standards for voter access, secure paper ballots, and routine, transparent audits would build the trust needed for any transition and encourage candidates to compete nationwide rather than in a handful of swing states.",
    "559": "Elections should make each lawful ballot carry comparable weight while preserving the federal balance that keeps smaller communities heard, so reforms must prioritize clear, auditable rules, uniform access and certification standards, and incentives for candidates to build broad, cross\u2011regional coalitions. A practical, incremental path is to pair proportional or district\u2011based allocation (or a national popular\u2011vote compact) with ranked\u2011choice voting, robust post\u2011election audits, and standardized recount triggers so outcomes become more legitimate and less dependent on a handful of swing jurisdictions.",

    "426": "Elections should be practical, transparent, and steady\u2014preserving the federal balance while making each ballot carry comparable weight. A sensible path is incremental reform: reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions through proportional or district allocation (or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact), and pair any change with uniform standards for access, paper ballots, and rigorous, public audits to restore confidence. Like restoring a classic car, changes ought to be meticulous, tested, and bipartisan so the system remains durable and trusted.",

Practical, incremental fixes that increase transparency and reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions will encourage broader campaigning and help rebuild confidence across rural and urban communities alike.",
    "586": "Elections should be structured so one person, one vote truly matters while preserving a meaningful role for states and smaller communities.

Incremental, clearly defined changes and strong audit rules can protect smaller communities while making outcomes better reflect the will of the voters.",
    "765": "Civics education and community engagement argue for reforms that preserve the federal balance while making every vote carry comparable weight. Pairing incremental fixes\u2014proportional or district-based allocation of electors and wider use of ranked-choice voting\u2014with a national-popular-vote mechanism (via an interstate compact) and uniform, transparent standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts would reduce winner-take-all distortions without upending federalism.

A workable path is to move toward outcomes that reflect the national popular will\u2014through proportional allocation of electors, an interstate popular\u2011vote compact, or ranked\u2011choice voting\u2014paired with uniform standards, auditable paper trails, and gradual, constitutional changes that preserve meaningful representation for smaller and rural communities.",
    "554": "Grounded in a preference for clear, reliable processes and broad community engagement, a workable path preserves the states\u2019 role while making each ballot matter more\u2014by moving toward proportional or district-based allocation of electors, encouraging ranked\u2011choice voting, and pursuing a National Popular Vote compact as an incremental option. Coupling those changes with uniform standards for ballot access, paper ballots, routine audits, and transparent recount rules would reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions, incentivize candidates to campaign everywhere, and rebuild public confidence across urban and rural communities.",
