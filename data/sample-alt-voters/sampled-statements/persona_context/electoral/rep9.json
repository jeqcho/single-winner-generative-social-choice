Pair any change with uniform, auditable standards for ballots, recounts, and election security so results are transparent and trusted. Implement reforms gradually with bipartisan oversight to protect stability, encourage nationwide campaigning, and restore public confidence.",
    "46": "Democratic legitimacy requires every lawful vote to carry comparable weight while preserving the federalist role of states, so a pragmatic reform path pairs measures to reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions (through proportional or district allocation or an interstate popular\u2011vote compact) with nationwide standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and clear recount rules. Phasing in ranked\u2011choice voting and other changes gradually with bipartisan oversight can encourage broader coalition\u2011building, lessen swing\u2011state dominance, and rebuild public trust in outcomes.",
    "340": "The presidential election system should preserve the federal balance that protects smaller and rural communities while making every vote carry comparable weight; practical, incremental reforms\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors or an interstate popular-vote compact with ranked-choice safeguards\u2014can reduce winner-take-all distortions without rewriting the Constitution.

Coupling reform with uniform standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and transparent recount procedures will build trust and encourage candidates to campaign for broad, cross-regional support.",

Implementing these changes gradually with bipartisan oversight and transparent audits balances democratic equality with federal stability.",
    "210": "Elections should be simple, transparent, and make every vote carry meaningful weight while preserving the role of states so small and rural communities are not ignored. A practical path is gradual reforms\u2014uniform standards for ballot access and audits, proportional allocation or congressional-district splits, and consideration of a national popular vote compact or ranked-choice voting\u2014that reduce winner-take-all distortions and build trust for working families. Changes must be clear and steady so outcomes are accepted and campaigns engage the whole country.",
    "204": "Rooted in community-oriented values and a preference for practical, trust-building solutions, reforms should preserve the federalist role of states while making every vote carry comparable weight\u2014for example through a National Popular Vote compact or by adopting proportional or district-based allocation alongside ranked-choice ballots.
