    "116": "Presidential elections should translate votes into outcomes in a way that feels equally fair in every community, while keeping the state-run framework that people trust for administering elections. A practical bridge is to move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally nationwide (or through the National Popular Vote compact), paired with ranked-choice voting to ensure broad support. To earn durable legitimacy, any reform should include clear national baselines for ballot access, auditable paper trails, and automatic recount triggers so results are transparent and consistent.",
    "136": "Presidential elections should be straightforward and trusted, and the winner should reflect the voters without turning the whole country into a handful of swing-state pit stops. A workable middle ground is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with anti-gerrymandering rules), paired with clear national standards for audits, recounts, and secure ballot handling. That preserves a meaningful role for states and smaller communities while making more votes count in every place.",
    "417": "Presidential elections should be engineered for legitimacy the way dependable software is: clear rules, predictable edge-case handling, and outcomes that match voter intent without gaming a handful of battleground states. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote compact, paired with uniform national standards for audits, recount thresholds, and ballot access. This approach respects federalism and regional voice while moving closer to the straightforward principle that the candidate with the most support nationwide should win.",
    "511": "Un sistema presidencial m\u00e1s justo deber\u00eda acercar el resultado al voto popular y, al mismo tiempo, mantener un papel claro para los estados para que ninguna regi\u00f3n se sienta ignorada. Una v\u00eda de consenso ser\u00eda avanzar con asignaci\u00f3n proporcional de electores o con el National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, acompa\u00f1ado de reglas nacionales b\u00e1sicas y transparentes para boletas, auditor\u00edas y recuentos. Eso har\u00eda que cada voto cuente m\u00e1s, reducir\u00eda la obsesi\u00f3n con unos pocos \u201cswing states\u201d y aumentar\u00eda la confianza en el resultado.",
    "782": "A credible reform should make the presidential outcome track the voters\u2019 will more closely while keeping elections orderly, auditable, and grounded in a meaningful role for states. Ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, recount triggers, and post-election audits\u2014would reduce swing-state distortions and increase trust without forcing a sudden constitutional rupture. If deeper change is pursued, the National Popular Vote compact or a ranked-choice national tally offers a practical path that rewards broad, peaceable coalition-building rather than razor-thin, divisive wins.",
    "211": "Any reform should keep the state-based character that protects smaller communities, but reduce the winner-take-all distortions that make too many voters feel ignored and put the whole race on a few battlegrounds. A practical middle path is proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with uniform, plain-language rules for voter identification, paper-backed audits, and clear recount triggers so results are easier to verify and accept. Changes should be incremental, transparent, and built to reward broad coalitions rather than narrow margins or procedural gamesmanship.",
    "131": "Reform should keep the state-run structure people trust while making the outcome track voter intent more closely, so elections aren\u2019t effectively decided by a few battleground counties. A practical middle path is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or a National Popular Vote compact once uniform audit, recount, and ballot standards are in place), alongside stronger guardrails against faithless electors. The goal is a system that rewards nationwide coalition-building, treats every ballot with comparable weight, and stays simple and transparent enough to earn acceptance even in close races.",
    "51": "Any reform to the Electoral College should keep the state-based structure that encourages broad coalitions, while reducing winner-take-all distortions that make too many ballots feel irrelevant. A workable middle path is proportional allocation of electors within each state, paired with uniform national baselines for audits, recount thresholds, and clear rules that bind electors to certified results. That approach respects federalism and smaller-community voice without ignoring the basic expectation that the national outcome should track the voters\u2019 will.",
    "367": "Presidential elections should reward broad, nationwide support and feel fair to voters whether they live in a safe state or a swing state, with rules simple enough to trust after a long workday. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through a National Popular Vote compact), paired with clear national baselines for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That approach respects smaller-state concerns while making outcomes track the people\u2019s votes more closely and reducing the incentive to campaign only in a handful of battlegrounds.",
    "526": "The Electoral College should be kept for its federal balance, but modernized so outcomes track voter intent more closely and fewer Americans feel written off in \u201csafe\u201d states. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, paired with uniform national standards for ballot security, audits, and recount thresholds so the process is transparent and trusted. Changes should be phased in deliberately and designed to reward broad, cross-regional coalitions rather than narrow swing-state strategies.",
    "455": "A strong reform should make presidential elections feel fair in plain English: the candidate with the most support nationwide should win, while every state still has a clear, trusted role in running elections. A practical bridge is to keep state-run voting but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally\u2014or use the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts so results are easier to verify and accept. The goal is less \u201cswing-state only\u201d politics and more coalition-building across cities, small towns, and the backroads alike.",
    "142": "Presidential elections should be decided in a way that makes every vote matter while keeping the rules simple, auditable, and consistent across states, so working families can trust the result without feeling like only a few swing places count. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional elector allocation nationwide, paired with uniform standards for ballots, recounts, and security. If broader change is needed, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014with clear recount thresholds and strong safeguards against faithless electors\u2014can move the system closer to the national popular will without abruptly stripping states of their role.",
    "433": "A strong reform would keep states running elections but ensure the presidency goes to the candidate with the broadest national support, so voters in \u201csafe\u201d states and \u201cswing\u201d states alike feel their ballots matter. The most workable bridge is a National Popular Vote-style approach or proportional allocation of electors, paired with ranked-choice voting to encourage majority-backed winners and less zero-sum campaigning. To address integrity concerns across parties, changes should include clear nationwide baselines for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers that make close results transparent and trusted.",
    "361": "Presidential elections should be simple to understand and fair enough that every ballot feels like it matters, not just those in a few battleground states. A practical compromise is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional elector allocation or adopting the National Popular Vote compact once clear, uniform standards for counting, audits, and recounts are in place. That approach preserves a role for smaller states and local communities while making outcomes match the voters more closely and strengthening trust across the country.",
    "143": "Electoral College reform should preserve the federal, state-run structure that keeps the process administrable and stable, while reducing winner-take-all distortions that make campaigns and litigation hinge on a few battlegrounds. A workable compromise is proportional allocation of electors within states (or a carefully designed national popular-vote compact), paired with clear nationwide baselines for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount thresholds so outcomes are transparent and trusted. Any change should be phased in and neutral as to party advantage, rewarding broad coalition-building and protecting both individual votes and regional voices.",
    "709": "A presidential election should reward broad, nationwide support while also respecting the practical role states play in running secure, verifiable elections. A workable bridge is to keep state administration but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through a National Popular Vote compact once uniform standards for audits, recounts, and ballot access are in place), so fewer voters feel ignored in \u201csafe\u201d states. Pairing that with ranked-choice voting for president can reduce spoiler fears and push candidates toward majority-building rather than razor-thin battleground strategies.",
    "253": "The presidential vote should land like paint on a shared canvas\u2014each mark carrying real weight\u2014so moving toward a national popular outcome, ideally with ranked-choice voting, would better match the country\u2019s will and reduce the grip of a few battleground states. If full replacement feels too abrupt, a strong bridge is proportional allocation of electors within states or the National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts. That combination can honor local administration and regional voice while giving people a result that feels fair, legible, and harder to game.",
    "421": "A credible reform should keep elections state-run and verifiable while making outcomes track the national popular will more closely, so voters in \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cswing\u201d states alike feel their ballots matter. A practical bridge is proportional allocation of electors within every state\u2014paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount thresholds\u2014to reduce winner-take-all distortions without erasing federalism. Adding ranked-choice voting for president would further reward broad, coalition-building support and lower the temperature around close, polarized contests.",
    "604": "Presidential elections should be run with the same attention to clear rules and accurate results expected in any job where a small mistake becomes a big problem, so outcomes are trusted even when they\u2019re close. A workable middle path is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through a national popular-vote compact), paired with uniform national standards for ballots, audits, and recount triggers. That approach makes more votes matter in every state, reduces \u201cswing-state\u201d games, and still respects the idea that different regions shouldn\u2019t be ignored.",
    "445": "Reform should keep the state-based structure that helps smaller communities feel heard, while reducing winner-take-all outcomes that make too many votes feel pointless and push campaigns into a few battlegrounds. A practical middle step is proportional allocation of electors in every state, paired with clear national baselines for audits, recount thresholds, and voter verification that are strict but not burdensome. That approach respects federalism and election security while moving closer to outcomes that match the people\u2019s choice and are easier to accept when life is busy and trust matters.",
    "521": "Presidential elections should be run with the same transparency and consistency expected in any well-kept public institution: clear national baseline rules for ballots, audits, and recounts, while keeping states responsible for administration. The Electoral College can be modernized by ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors\u2014or a National Popular Vote compact with strong safeguards\u2014so outcomes track the people\u2019s vote more closely without making smaller communities feel erased. Pairing that with ranked-choice voting would reward broad coalition-building and reduce the sense that a few battleground places decide everything.",
    "55": "Presidential elections should be easier to trust and explain, with outcomes that track the will of voters while still giving every region a reason to feel seen. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, paired with clear nationwide baselines for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount thresholds. That would reduce \u201cswing-state\u201d distortion, reward broad coalition-building, and lower the temperature by making both the rules and the results feel fair.",
    "768": "Presidential elections should honor the principle that each ballot carries equal weight while still respecting that states administer elections and smaller communities don\u2019t want to be politically invisible. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, paired with clear national baselines for access, audits, and recounts so outcomes are transparent and trusted. Over time, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014ideally alongside ranked-choice voting\u2014can move results closer to the national will while encouraging candidates to build broader, cross-regional coalitions.",
    "126": "A good reform should keep the steadiness of a state-based system while making the result track the people\u2019s vote more closely, so fewer citizens feel ignored in \u201csafe\u201d states and fewer elections turn into hair\u2011raising disputes. Ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional elector allocation, paired with clear national standards for counting, audits, and recounts, offers a practical middle path between abolishing the Electoral College and leaving it untouched. If broader change is needed, an interstate compact that honors the national popular vote can serve as a careful bridge, provided the rules are transparent, uniform, and hard to game.",
    "458": "The Electoral College should be kept for the stability and state balance it provides, but modernized so outcomes track voter intent more closely and campaigns aren\u2019t dictated by a handful of swing states. A practical middle path is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with clear nationwide standards for voter verification, auditable paper trails, and automatic recount thresholds. That approach respects rural and small-state concerns while giving people in every state a reason to turn out, and it builds trust by making the rules simpler, more transparent, and harder to game.",
    "11": "Presidential elections should honor both personal freedom and social responsibility by treating each voter\u2019s voice with equal respect while keeping communities outside major metro areas from feeling invisible. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors, with an added National Popular Vote compact backstop so the overall winner matches the national will. Any shift should come with clear, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts to reduce anxiety and make results easier for families and caregivers to trust and move forward with.",
    "776": "A workable reform should keep states administering elections and preserve the incentive for candidates to build broad geographic coalitions, while reducing the winner-take-all distortion that makes too many voters feel irrelevant. Allocating electors proportionally within each state\u2014paired with clear national baselines for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount thresholds\u2014would align outcomes more closely with the popular will without forcing an abrupt constitutional rewrite. If additional legitimacy is needed, a carefully designed national popular-vote backstop (potentially through an interstate compact) could apply once uniform standards are in place and broadly trusted.",
    "637": "The Electoral College should be kept but modernized so outcomes track the voters more closely without letting a few swing states\u2014or a handful of big media markets\u2014dominate campaigns. Requiring states to award electors proportionally or by congressional district, while binding electors to the certified vote and setting clear nationwide standards for audits and recounts, would improve fairness and confidence while respecting federalism. The aim should be a system that honors both the national will and the voices of smaller communities, so losing sides can accept results and the country can move on together.",
    "115": "Reform should keep the state-based structure that protects smaller communities from getting steamrolled, while tightening procedures so the winner more consistently reflects the voters and the process is easy to verify. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional (or district-based) elector allocation, paired with uniform national baselines for voter verification, paper trails, audits, and clear recount triggers. That approach makes more votes matter in every state, reduces swing-state gamesmanship, and strengthens confidence that the outcome is legitimate even when tensions run high.",
    "653": "Presidential elections should be easy to understand and feel fair, so the winner usually matches the national vote while rural and smaller communities still have a real reason to believe they\u2019re being heard. A practical compromise is keeping state-run elections but ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional elector allocation, paired with clear national baselines for accessible ballots, auditable paper trails, and automatic recount thresholds. Over time, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact could serve as a tested bridge toward a system where every vote counts the same without forcing a sudden, distrust-fueled overhaul.",
    "210": "Presidential elections should be easy to understand and feel fair to working families, so the winner more consistently matches the votes people cast while still respecting states\u2019 role in running elections. A practical middle path is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, paired with clear national baselines for audits, recounts, and ballot access. That would make fewer voters feel ignored in \u201csafe\u201d states, reduce swing-state obsession, and build trust without forcing an abrupt constitutional overhaul.",
    "119": "Presidential elections work best when the outcome is easy to verify, feels fair in every community, and doesn\u2019t hinge on a handful of swing counties. A practical reform path would keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with uniform national standards for ballots, audits, and recount thresholds. Adding ranked-choice voting where feasible would encourage coalition-building and reduce spoiler fears, strengthening legitimacy whether the margins are wide or razor-thin.",
    "618": "Electing a president should reward broad, nationwide support while keeping the rules straightforward, auditable, and hard to game, so the outcome is trusted even in close years. A practical compromise is to keep state-run elections and the Electoral College framework but replace winner-take-all with proportional (or district-based with anti-gerrymandering guardrails) allocation, bind electors to the certified vote, and adopt uniform national standards for recounts and basic ballot security. That approach preserves the federal balance smaller states care about while making more votes matter in every state and reducing the sense that a few battlegrounds decide everything.",
    "406": "Electoral College reform should preserve the federal balance that keeps smaller states relevant while making outcomes track more closely with the voters\u2019 overall will and reducing the outsized power of a handful of battlegrounds. A practical middle path is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation of electors (or a carefully designed popular-vote compact), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, auditable paper trails, recount thresholds, and firm rules against faithless electors. Changes should be incremental, transparent, and built for legitimacy and national cohesion rather than short-term partisan gain.",
    "230": "A system for choosing the president should be as measurable and auditable as any quality check: consistent rules, clear recount triggers, and results that match how people actually voted. The best common-ground reform is moving toward the national popular will without erasing the states\u2019 role\u2014either through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or by ending winner-take-all with proportional electors\u2014so fewer voters feel written off in \u201csafe\u201d states. Pairing that with ranked-choice voting and uniform baseline standards for ballots, certification, and audits would reward broader coalitions and make outcomes easier to accept across rural and urban communities alike.",
    "774": "Presidential elections should reward broad, national support while treating each ballot with comparable weight, so outcomes feel legitimate beyond a few battleground states. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but reduce winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, while continuing to support the National Popular Vote compact as a clear path toward aligning results with the national vote. Pairing either approach with uniform baseline standards for access, audits, and recounts would strengthen trust and reduce the sense that elections are decided by technicalities rather than voters.",
    "654": "Presidential elections should be run with the same clarity and consistency expected in any well-managed operation: every ballot counted accurately, rules that are uniform enough to trust, and outcomes that reflect the will of voters rather than a handful of swing states. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, while expanding the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact as more states adopt shared standards for audits, recounts, and certification. Pairing that with ranked-choice voting for president would reward coalition-building and reduce \u201cspoiler\u201d fears, helping both rural and urban communities feel seen. The goal is a system that protects regional voice without letting geography outweigh people.",
    "547": "The Electoral College should be kept for its federal balance, but the winner-take-all approach in most states ought to be replaced with a more proportional method so fewer voters feel written off and campaigns have reason to show up beyond a handful of battlegrounds. Any change should come with clear, uniform rules for recounts, audits, and elector accountability, because public confidence depends on elections that are simple to explain and easy to verify. A practical bridge is proportional allocation within states now, with the option of a carefully designed national popular-vote compact later if broad agreement and strong safeguards are in place.",
    "787": "The Electoral College can be kept as a guardrail for a big, diverse country, but it should be updated so results track voter intent more closely and fewer communities feel ignored. Requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, binding electors to the vote, and setting clear national standards for audits, recounts, and basic ballot security would improve fairness and trust without forcing a sudden overhaul. Whatever reform is chosen should be simple to understand, hard to game, and built to reward candidates who earn broad support across regions\u2014not just a handful of battleground states.",
    "577": "Presidential elections should be simple to understand, easy to trust, and fair enough that families juggling work and kids don\u2019t feel like their vote is \u201cwasted\u201d just because they live in a safe state. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or joining a national popular vote compact), paired with clear nationwide standards for audits, recounts, and ballot access. That protects a meaningful role for states and rural communities while making outcomes track more closely with what voters actually chose and reducing the sense that a few battleground counties decide everything.",
    "628": "The Electoral College can be preserved to respect the federal balance and keep rural communities from being overlooked, while still being modernized so results track voters more closely and feel legitimate. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with anti-gerrymandering safeguards), bind electors to the vote, and adopt clear nationwide standards for audits, recounts, and ballot security. Reforms should be incremental and transparent, rewarding candidates who build broad, cross-regional coalitions rather than chasing a few battleground states.",
    "90": "Presidential elections should feel like a clean mix: every vote carries real weight, but the country\u2019s regional voices still come through without distortion. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections while ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts so results are trusted when margins get tight. If the nation wants to go further, the National Popular Vote compact can move outcomes closer to the popular will without forcing an abrupt constitutional break.",
    "353": "The Electoral College should be kept for the stability it provides and the way it pushes candidates to pay attention beyond the biggest media markets, but it needs updating so fewer voters feel written off in \u201csafe\u201d states. A practical compromise is proportional allocation of electors within each state, paired with clear nationwide standards for recounts, audits, and binding electors to the state\u2019s vote to reduce doubts and late-game chaos. That preserves the federal balance many value while moving outcomes closer to the straightforward idea that the winner should reflect the voters\u2019 will.",
    "307": "Reforming the Electoral College should prioritize clear, uniform procedures that make results easy to verify and harder to litigate\u2014national baselines for voter eligibility checks, paper-auditable counting, and consistent recount triggers. Rather than abolishing the system outright, states could move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with anti-gerrymandering safeguards), preserving a meaningful role for states while making outcomes track voter intent more closely. Any change should be phased in through a transparent, bipartisan process so urban and rural communities alike can trust that the rules are stable and the outcome reflects lawful votes.",
    "229": "Reforms to the Electoral College should keep the state-based structure that protects smaller communities, but reduce winner-take-all outcomes so fewer voters feel written off in \u201csafe\u201d states. A practical middle ground is proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, paired with clear national baselines for ballot security, audits, and recounts so the rules are consistent and trusted.

    "80": "The best reforms would keep elections state-run and easy to audit while making outcomes track more closely with the voters\u2019 actual choices, so results feel legitimate even in close years. Ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with clear national standards for recounts, certification, and strong paper-trail audits\u2014would reduce swing-state distortion without erasing the federal balance smaller communities value.

A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but reduce winner-take-all distortions through proportional elector allocation or a National Popular Vote compact, ideally paired with ranked-choice voting to ensure broad support. Clear nationwide baselines for ballot access, recount triggers, and certification\u2014plus strong protections for election workers\u2014can honor both the national will and the desire that smaller and rural communities not be brushed aside.",
    "552": "Presidential elections should translate votes into outcomes in a way that feels fair, auditable, and predictable, so legitimacy doesn\u2019t hinge on a handful of swing-state margins or confusing state-by-state quirks. A pragmatic bridge is to keep state-run administration but end winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation, while states join a strengthened National Popular Vote compact that triggers only alongside clear national baselines for ballot access, recount thresholds, and post-election audits. Pairing that with ranked-choice voting for president would reward broader coalitions and reduce spoiler fears, while still encouraging candidates to compete beyond major metros and the usual battlegrounds.",
    "25": "Presidential elections should reward broad national support while making each ballot feel equally meaningful, not just in a handful of swing states. A practical reform is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and binding them to the vote, paired with clear nationwide standards for audits, recounts, and secure, accessible voting. That middle path protects smaller communities from being ignored while better matching outcomes to the popular will and lowering the temperature after close races.",
    "226": "Reforms should make the presidential election feel fair to everyday voters by reducing winner-take-all outcomes that leave \u201csafe-state\u201d communities ignored while still keeping states involved in running elections.

A practical compromise is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional or district-based elector allocation, paired with clear national standards for voter ID options, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount thresholds so the count is trustworthy and repeatable. That preserves the federal balance conservatives tend to value while making more ballots matter in every state and lowering the temperature when elections are close.",
