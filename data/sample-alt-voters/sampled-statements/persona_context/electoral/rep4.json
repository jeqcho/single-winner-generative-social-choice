    "243": "Presidential elections should be decided by rules that are easy to explain, consistent across states, and credible enough that losing voters can accept the outcome peacefully. A practical bridge is to keep state administration but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors\u2014or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with uniform standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers. These steps preserve federalism and smaller-state visibility while making outcomes track the voters more closely and reducing the swing-state lottery.",
    "404": "The best reform is one that makes the winner match the people\u2019s vote while keeping elections transparent, secure, and run in a way every community can trust. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national standards for access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers. That combination would reduce the swing-state stranglehold, protect minority communities from being overlooked, and help the country accept results without feeling the rules were rigged.",
    "571": "A workable reform should honor the federal role of states while ensuring the national outcome reliably reflects the voters\u2019 choice, so legitimacy doesn\u2019t hinge on a handful of battlegrounds. Replacing winner-take-all with proportional allocation of electors\u2014or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it reaches the threshold\u2014would make more ballots matter in every state without forcing a sudden constitutional break. Whatever path is chosen should be paired with clear, teachable nationwide baselines for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers so results are transparent, verifiable, and easier for communities to accept even in close races.",
    "141": "A presidential election system should be simple enough to trust, fair enough that the winner matches the people\u2019s choice, and balanced enough that rural and urban communities both feel seen. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by requiring states to allocate electors proportionally (or through a national popular vote compact once it reaches a clear threshold), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers. That keeps states central to running elections while reducing the swing-state lottery and making every vote matter more evenly.",
    "601": "The presidential election system should be modernized so the winner more consistently reflects the national popular will, without making smaller states and rural communities feel like they\u2019ve been pushed off the menu. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or using the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the process is easy to trust. Reforms should reward broad, cross-regional support and reduce the swing-state obsession that leaves too many voters feeling ignored.",
    "224": "A durable reform should keep the states\u2019 administrative role while making outcomes track the voters\u2019 will more closely, so the rules remain teachable, transparent, and broadly legitimate. The most workable bridge is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or adopting a popular-vote compact once it reaches a clear threshold), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers. As any well-run institution learns, trust comes from consistent procedures, clear accountability, and results that can be explained without special pleading.",
    "460": "The system for choosing a president should make it simple for working families to trust that every ballot matters, without turning the whole country into a fight over a handful of swing states. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional electoral-vote allocation nationwide, paired with clear national standards for access, paper-based audits, and automatic recount triggers. That respects smaller communities\u2019 desire to be heard while making outcomes line up more closely with the popular vote and lowering the temperature when elections are close.",
    "167": "The presidential election system should be modernized to better match the will of voters while keeping states central to administering elections and ensuring every region still matters. A practical compromise is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races. If broader agreement grows, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a steady transition toward a result that aligns more consistently with the national vote. The aim is a process that is fair, teachable, and trustworthy enough that people accept outcomes even when their side loses.",
    "314": "Reforming the Electoral College should focus on the same thing customers expect in any fair system: clear rules, consistent treatment, and results that match what people actually chose. A practical bridge is keeping states in charge of running elections while ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation (or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with uniform national standards for access, audits, and recounts so outcomes are trusted. Adding ranked-choice voting would encourage broader, less polarizing campaigns and make it harder for elections to hinge on a few razor-thin swing-state margins.",
    "357": "The Electoral College can be preserved to respect the role of states and avoid a system that only rewards the biggest media markets, but it should be updated so outcomes track voters more closely and fewer communities feel written off. A practical compromise is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or a district method with guardrails against gerrymandering), binding electors to the certified results, and setting clear national standards for voter ID, audits, and recount triggers. Those steps keep federal balance while making the rules simpler to trust and harder to game, no matter which party benefits in a given year.",
    "210": "The presidency should be won in a way that feels clean, straightforward, and fair\u2014so no family feels their vote matters less just because of where they live. A practical bridge is to keep states running elections but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional electoral votes or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national rules for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That would reduce swing\u2011state games, improve trust, and still encourage candidates to listen to both big cities and smaller communities.",
    "704": "Presidential elections should feel like good community decision-making: every ballot counted transparently and consistently, with rules simple enough that people trust the outcome even when it stings. A practical bridge is to keep states administering elections but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide or, better yet, adopt the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it guarantees the popular-vote winner prevails. Pair either approach with uniform national standards for access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers, so fairness, security, and broad legitimacy rise together.",
    "309": "Replacing winner-take-all rules with proportional allocation of electors would keep states meaningfully involved while making outcomes track the people\u2019s vote more closely and reducing the swing\u2011state stranglehold. Pairing that with clear national baselines\u2014paper-backed auditing, uniform recount triggers, and strong protections for ballot access\u2014would make results easier to verify and harder to weaponize. A long-term path like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, ideally strengthened by ranked-choice voting, can offer a practical upgrade that rewards broad, cross-regional support without tearing up the whole system overnight.",
    "60": "Presidential elections should be decided in a way that makes every ballot feel like it matters, not just the ones in a handful of swing states, while still respecting that states run elections and have different needs. A practical bridge is to keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers so close races don\u2019t spiral into chaos. If consensus grows beyond that, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014ideally alongside ranked-choice voting\u2014can align the outcome with the popular will without abruptly rewriting the whole system.",
    "762": "The Electoral College can be retained to respect the country\u2019s federal balance, but winner-take-all rules should be replaced with proportional allocation so fewer voters are written off in \u201csafe\u201d states and campaigns have reason to compete everywhere. Clear, consistent national standards for voter verification, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers would strengthen confidence that close elections are decided fairly. A reform path that keeps states administering elections while aligning outcomes more closely with the popular will offers a practical middle ground most Americans can trust.",
    "484": "Presidential elections should feel simple and fair to working people, not like the whole country gets decided by a few swing states, so replacing winner-take-all with proportional allocation of electors is a strong step that still respects states. If the nation wants the clearest outcome, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can align results with the popular vote without rewriting everything overnight. Either way, uniform baseline rules for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers would build trust and let candidates compete everywhere, not just where the map says it\u2019s close.",
    "752": "Back in my day, people could disagree and still trust the rules, and that\u2019s what presidential elections need again: clear standards, transparent audits, and electors bound to the voters\u2019 decision. The Electoral College can be kept to respect the federal balance, but states should move away from winner-take-all toward proportional or district-based allocation so fewer communities feel written off. Pairing those changes with consistent nationwide rules for ballot access, recounts, and election security would make results easier to accept\u2014whether the margin is a landslide or razor thin.",
    "439": "Presidential elections should be decided by rules that are easy to teach, easy to verify, and fair enough that people accept the outcome even when disappointed. A practical bridge is to keep state administration but curb winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or joining a national popular vote compact, paired with clear nationwide standards for access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers. That approach protects regional voices while making each ballot matter more evenly and reduces the swing-state mentality that leaves too many communities ignored.",
    "51": "The Electoral College can be retained to respect the federal balance, but the winner\u2011take\u2011all approach should be replaced with proportional allocation so fewer voters feel written off in \u201csafe\u201d states. A uniform national baseline for election administration\u2014clear ballot rules, automatic post\u2011election audits, and consistent recount triggers\u2014would strengthen confidence without stripping states of their role. Pairing these changes with binding electors would make outcomes easier to explain, harder to dispute, and more reflective of the electorate while still encouraging candidates to compete beyond the largest media markets.",
    "363": "The best fix is to keep the states\u2019 role in running elections while ending winner-take-all rules so electoral votes reflect the actual split of voters and fewer places get written off as \u201csafe.\u201d A national popular-vote guarantee\u2014whether through a compact or amendment\u2014can be paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and recount triggers so folks trust the count and accept close outcomes. That kind of reform rewards broad, cross\u2011regional support and steadies the ship without letting any one corner of the country call all the shots, which is better than buying a pig in a poke.",
    "149": "The Electoral College can be kept for the way it forces candidates to work more than one seam of the country, but the winner-take-all setup is an overburden that leaves too many voters feeling like their ballot got buried. A practical fix is requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state, binding electors to the vote, and setting clear national baselines for paper-backed audits, recount triggers, and ballot handling so the count is solid and trusted. That keeps smaller states from getting sidelined while making the final result track the public\u2019s choice more closely and lowering the heat when elections run tight.",
    "48": "The presidential election system should be updated so outcomes align more closely with the voters\u2019 will while still respecting states\u2019 role in administering elections and ensuring rural and smaller communities are not treated as an afterthought. A workable bridge is to end winner\u2011take\u2011all by allocating electors proportionally (or through a widely adopted national popular vote compact), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so results are both fair and verifiable. Reforms that reward broad, cross\u2011regional support and reduce the swing\u2011state lottery would strengthen legitimacy and lower the temperature after close elections.",
    "235": "Presidential elections should be decided by rules that are simple to teach, easy to verify, and fair enough that people accept the outcome even when disappointed. A workable compromise is to keep the Electoral College\u2019s state role but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, paper audits, and automatic recount triggers. That approach reduces the swing\u2011state lottery, makes more votes matter in every state, and preserves the sense that both large and small communities count.",
    "410": "Presidential elections should produce results that feel as fair and verifiable as any well-run public institution: every lawful vote counted consistently, with transparent audits and clear recount triggers that reduce suspicion and stress. The most workable bridge is keeping states\u2019 administrative role while ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation (or a national popular-vote compact once enough states join), so outcomes track the public\u2019s choice without making smaller communities feel erased. Pairing any reform with uniform baseline standards for ballot access, secure paper-backed counting, and binding electors to the certified result would reward broad, nationwide campaigning and strengthen legitimacy across regions.",
    "275": "A presidential election system should be clear enough to teach, fair enough to trust, and designed so candidates have reasons to show up for communities beyond a handful of swing states. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or via the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it reaches a majority), paired with uniform national standards for access, paper-based audits, and automatic recount triggers. That way, the winner more reliably reflects the people\u2019s choice while smaller and rural states still matter\u2014fair is fair, however you slice it.",
    "427": "The presidential election system should better match the national popular will while keeping states central to administration and accountability, because legitimacy depends on clear rules and consistent recordkeeping. A practical bridge is to end state winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation (or a national popular-vote compact), paired with uniform nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount triggers. That combination would reduce swing-state distortion, make more voters feel heard in every region, and strengthen trust regardless of which party wins.",
    "205": "A presidential election should feel like honest work: the person with the most real support ought to win, and the rules should be clear enough that people can trust the result and get back to their lives. A strong compromise is keeping the state role in running elections but ending winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally, or using a national popular vote compact once it has enough states, so fewer voters are treated as invisible in \u201csafe\u201d places. Along with that, consistent national standards for ballots, recounts, and audits would bring more transparency and less suspicion. The goal is a system that respects rural and urban communities alike and rewards broad effort, not just a narrow path through a few swing states.",
    "517": "The best reform keeps states involved but stops treating millions of votes as if they don\u2019t matter, by ending winner\u2011take\u2011all and moving to proportional allocation or the National Popular Vote compact so the presidency lines up with the people\u2019s choice more often. Clear, uniform rules for ballots, audits, and recounts would make outcomes easier to accept, especially in close races. A system that values every voter while still encouraging candidates to show up in smaller communities would lower the temperature and rebuild trust.",
    "565": "The Electoral College can be kept for stability and to ensure smaller states aren\u2019t ignored, but winner-take-all rules should be replaced with proportional allocation so results track more closely with how people actually vote. Clear, uniform national standards for ballot security, audits, and recount triggers would make the process easier to trust and harder to dispute. That kind of practical update preserves the state-based framework while giving more voters\u2014whether in safe states or swing states\u2014a reason to believe their vote truly matters.",
    "674": "Replacing winner-take-all with proportional allocation of electors in every state would keep a meaningful state role while making outcomes track the popular will more closely and reducing the swing\u2011state stranglehold. Pairing that with clear national baselines for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers would strengthen transparency and legitimacy without stripping states of administration. If broader consensus emerges, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact offers a practical glide path toward one person\u2013one vote while still rewarding candidates who build support across regions.",
    "165": "The Electoral College can still serve a purpose in keeping smaller states from feeling written off, but the winner-take-all approach in most states distorts outcomes and fuels mistrust. A practical compromise would keep the state-based framework while requiring proportional allocation of electors and binding electors to the certified results, backed by clear national baseline standards for paper-backed auditing, recount triggers, and ballot handling. That mix respects federalism and election integrity while making results track the voters more closely and giving campaigns a reason to compete beyond a handful of swing states.",
    "790": "The Electoral College can be kept as a federalist guardrail, but the winner\u2011take\u2011all shortcut should be replaced with proportional allocation in every state so fewer voters feel written off and fewer elections hinge on a handful of battlegrounds. Pairing that with uniform national baselines for ballot access, auditable paper records, automatic recount triggers, and binding rules against faithless electors would strengthen legitimacy without centralizing day\u2011to\u2011day election administration. If the country still wants a clearer \u201cmost votes wins\u201d outcome, the National Popular Vote compact offers a lawful, incremental path that can coexist with strong integrity standards and broad, nationwide campaigning incentives.",
    "258": "Presidential elections should feel fair and understandable, so the winner reflects the people\u2019s votes while still keeping states involved in running secure, trusted elections. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional elector allocation (or the National Popular Vote compact once enough states join), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and clear recount triggers. That combination would make fewer communities feel ignored, reduce the swing\u2011state lottery effect, and build confidence in close results without abruptly rewriting everything.",
    "728": "Presidential elections should reward broad national support while making every ballot feel like it counts, not just votes in a handful of swing states. A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or via the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with uniform baseline rules for access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers. That combination respects regional voices and stability while better aligning outcomes with the popular will and lowering the temperature around close results.",
    "531": "Presidential elections should reward the candidate who earns the broadest support from voters while keeping states\u2019 administrative role clear, auditable, and consistent, since trust collapses when rules vary wildly across lines on a map. A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with uniform standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers. That would make outcomes track the popular will more closely, reduce the swing-state lottery effect, and still respect regional voices without treating any community as disposable.",
    "286": "The presidential election system should be modernized so the winner more consistently matches the national popular will, without dismissing the legitimate desire of smaller and rural states to feel heard. A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close elections are trusted and promptly settled. Over time, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014combined with ranked-choice voting\u2014offers a stable path toward \u201cone person, one vote\u201d while still encouraging candidates to build broad, cross-regional coalitions.",
    "341": "The Electoral College can be retained to preserve a meaningful role for states and avoid elections being driven by a handful of dense media markets, but it should be modernized so outcomes more closely reflect the will of voters nationwide. Ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation (or a district method that is protected from gerrymandering), requiring electors to follow certified results, and adopting clear national standards for voter verification, audits, and recounts would improve fairness and confidence. Reforms should reward broad, cross-regional support and make the rules simple enough that most Americans can accept the result even when their side loses.",
    "182": "The Electoral College should be kept for the stability it brings and the way it forces candidates to pay attention beyond the biggest metros, but winner-take-all rules in most states should be replaced with a proportional or district-based approach so fewer voters feel written off. National baseline standards for ballot handling, voter ID, audits, and recount triggers would make close elections easier to verify and harder to dispute, no matter who wins. That kind of reform respects federalism and rural voices while moving results closer to the actual vote totals and lowering the temperature around election night outcomes.",
    "248": "Presidential elections should produce outcomes that match the public\u2019s will while still respecting states\u2019 role in administering a process people can audit and trust, especially when the stakes feel as high as patient safety and system reliability. A pragmatic bridge is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with uniform baseline standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers. This would reduce swing-state distortions, reward candidates who build broader coalitions across regions, and make the result easier for both urban and rural communities to accept.",
    "100": "Presidential elections should feel fair to busy families and workers, where every vote matters whether it\u2019s cast in a \u201csafe\u201d state or a swing state, while still respecting that states run elections and smaller communities don\u2019t want to be ignored. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once enough states join), paired with clear national standards for access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers. That keeps the system stable and teachable, lowers the temperature in close races, and makes the winner line up with the people\u2019s choice more often.",
    "453": "Presidential elections should be decided by rules that people in every community can explain, verify, and accept, with the winner reflecting voters rather than a handful of swing states. A practical bridge is keeping state-run elections but ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation (or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it reaches 270), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers. That respects federalism and regional voices while honoring the basic idea that each vote ought to carry comparable weight. In the long run, reforms should reduce zero-sum incentives and protect civil rights so public trust in peaceful transitions stays rock solid.",
    "589": "The Electoral College can be kept to preserve a balance between states, but winner-take-all rules should be replaced with proportional or district-based allocation so fewer voters feel written off and fewer elections hinge on a handful of battlegrounds. Trust would improve with clear, uniform national baselines for ballot access, voter verification, audits, and recount triggers, so every lawful vote is handled the same way. Reforms should aim for an outcome that usually matches the popular will while still pushing candidates to compete beyond major media markets and coastal metros.",
    "209": "Presidential elections should feel como pan comido\u2014clear, fair, and hard to game\u2014so the winner reflects the people\u2019s choice without treating rural or smaller-state voters like an afterthought. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation of electors (or the National Popular Vote compact), paired with uniform national rules for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers so every state follows the same playbook. That keeps the state role intact while making outcomes match real vote margins and giving more communities a reason to believe their vote actually cuenta.",
    "568": "The Electoral College can be retained for its federal balance, but the winner\u2011take\u2011all approach should be replaced with proportional allocation so fewer voters are written off and outcomes track the public\u2019s will more closely.

A practical path is to keep the Electoral College but require proportional allocation of electors, bind electors to the state result, and adopt clear national baselines for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers so integrity and fairness are strengthened together.

A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform national baselines for voter verification, ballot handling, and risk-limiting audits so results are fast, transparent, and hard to dispute. If the country ever moves to a national popular vote, it should be paired with clear recount triggers and majority-building tools like ranked-choice voting to strengthen legitimacy and reduce zero-sum incentives.",

A practical bridge is nationwide baseline standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount triggers, paired with proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.

    "284": "The rules for picking a president should feel simple and fair to people working everyday jobs, not like everything comes down to a few swing states while everyone else gets ignored. A strong middle-ground reform is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional electoral votes (or adopting the National Popular Vote compact), paired with clear national standards for access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers. That protects regional voices while making outcomes line up better with what voters actually choose, which is the best way to rebuild trust and lower the temperature after close elections.",
    "676": "The Electoral College doesn\u2019t need to be demoed to the studs, but it does need a solid rebuild so outcomes track voters more closely and campaigns stop treating most states like they\u2019re off the jobsite.
