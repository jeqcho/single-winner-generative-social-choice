A phased interstate compact or a national popular vote paired with ranked\u2011choice voting and strong safeguards can reduce winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions without abruptly overturning the federal balance. Transparency, auditability, and civic education should accompany any reform to rebuild confidence and encourage broad participation.",
