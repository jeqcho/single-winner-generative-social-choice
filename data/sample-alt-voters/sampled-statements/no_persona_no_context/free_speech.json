    "We can agree that protecting the right to express diverse opinions is essential for a healthy democracy while also recognizing that speech that directly incites violence or targets people with dehumanizing abuse causes real harm and undermines social trust. A balanced approach seeks narrow, clearly defined limits on speech that demonstrably harms others, paired with robust education and counter-speech to address hateful ideas without needlessly silencing dissent.",
    "Most people value both free expression and human dignity, so a constructive path is to prohibit speech that intentionally incites violence or facilitates discrimination while preserving broad protections for controversial but non-harmful debate. Combining limited legal constraints with community standards, support for vulnerable groups, and incentives for respectful discourse can help reconcile safety and liberty.",
    "Finding common ground means acknowledging that free speech is vital but not absolute, and that society has a legitimate interest in restricting speech that directly threatens others or encourages imminent criminal acts. Clear, narrowly tailored rules against such conduct alongside open forums for rebuttal and education can protect both free inquiry and the rights of targeted communities.",
    "We can bridge divides by agreeing that hateful rhetoric that leads to harm\u2014such as targeted threats, calls for violence, or coordinated harassment\u2014should be constrained, while allowing space for vigorous debate and unpopular ideas that do not cause tangible injury. Emphasizing precise legal definitions, transparent enforcement, and restorative measures helps balance individual freedoms with collective safety.",
    "Rather than an all-or-nothing stance, most reasonable approaches limit only those forms of speech that are clearly linked to harm, like incitement, threats, or coordinated discrimination, while protecting contentious but nonviolent expression. Complementing narrow legal limits with education, dialogue, and support for affected communities builds resilience without eroding core free-speech principles.",
    "Protecting free speech is vital to democratic debate, but so is preventing speech that directly incites violence or targets vulnerable groups in ways that cause real harm. A shared approach focuses on narrowly defined legal limits for clear harms, combined with education and community norms to discourage hateful attitudes while preserving robust, critical discourse.",
    "We can agree that free expression should be broad enough to allow dissent and critique, yet society also has a responsibility to limit speech that intentionally foments violence or discrimination. Striking a middle ground means applying specific, transparent rules against direct incitement and harassment while investing in counter-speech and restorative measures to address prejudice.",
    "Balancing free speech and protection from hate requires recognizing both the importance of open debate and the tangible harms certain speech can inflict on targeted communities. Common ground lies in narrowly banning speech that poses an imminent risk of harm, while relying on education, civil remedies, and platform policies to address less clear cases.",
    "Most people value free speech but also want safe, inclusive communities, so a pragmatic compromise is to protect expressive freedom broadly while prohibiting speech that clearly threatens safety or equal access to rights. Complementing legal limits with public education, support for victims, and robust counter-speech can help bridge differing priorities.",
    "A constructive starting point is to uphold free speech as a default while carving out narrow, well-defined exceptions for hate speech that directly incites violence or constitutes targeted harassment. Pairing those limits with efforts to foster respectful dialogue and to address underlying prejudice can help reconcile concerns on both sides of the debate.",
    "We can uphold free speech while agreeing that expressions which directly incite violence, constitute true threats, or target individuals with sustained harassment should have clear, narrowly defined limits to protect safety. At the same time, we should favor remedies like counter-speech, education, and precise legal standards rather than broad bans that chill legitimate debate.",
    "Protecting open discourse and protecting people from harm are both important goals, so common ground lies in restricting only those forms of speech that intentionally provoke imminent violence, make credible threats, or enable coordinated harassment. Outside those narrow, well-defined areas, societies should rely on non-censorial responses\u2014counter-speech, sanctions for conduct, and public education\u2014to address hateful ideas.",
    "Most can agree that free expression deserves broad protection, but that protection should not include unambiguous calls to violence, targeted threats, or persistent dehumanizing harassment that foreseeably causes harm. Establishing transparent, narrowly tailored rules and investing in education and community support can bridge concerns about safety and liberty.",
    "A shared approach is to defend robust debate while carving out limited, clearly defined exceptions for speech that directly incites imminent illegal action or constitutes targeted threats and sustained abuse. Emphasizing due process, precise definitions, and non-coercive responses like counter-speech helps reconcile free-speech principles with the need to protect vulnerable people.",
    "We can find common ground by agreeing that freedom of expression is essential, yet it should not shield speech that intentionally and immediately endangers others through threats, calls for violence, or systematic harassment. Prioritizing narrowly drawn legal limits, transparency, and alternatives such as education and community-led responses balances rights and harms.",
    "We can affirm the vital role of free expression while recognizing that speech intentionally designed to cause imminent violence or targeted harassment can destroy others' ability to participate equally in public life; reasonable limits should be narrowly drawn to prevent clear harm without chilling legitimate debate. Any restrictions ought to be transparent, proportionate, and subject to oversight so they protect vulnerable people while preserving robust, diverse discourse.",
    "Free speech and protection from harm are both core democratic values, so common ground lies in allowing broad discussion but drawing precise, evidence-based lines against direct incitement, credible threats, and sustained, targeted harassment that silences others. Safeguards such as clear definitions, due process, and avenues for appeal can help ensure limits address real harms while minimizing overreach.",
    "Many people agree that society should protect open expression yet also prevent speech that intentionally and imminently endangers others or deprives groups of safety and equal participation; a balanced approach uses narrowly tailored restrictions focused on direct harm rather than vague or sweeping bans. Emphasizing proportionality, transparency, and independent review can bridge concerns about both censorship and unchecked abuse.",
    "It helps to start from the shared belief that free speech is essential but not absolute, and to limit only those expressions that cross into targeted threats, incitement to violence, or systematic dehumanization that foreseeably causes harm. Crafting rules that are specific, evidence-driven, and subject to regular scrutiny can build trust across perspectives while protecting vulnerable communities and public discourse.",
    "People on different sides can agree that protecting open debate and protecting people from real-world harm are both important, so reasonable limits should focus on narrowly defined acts like direct calls for violence, serious threats, and coordinated harassment that silence others. Ensuring clarity, accountability, and remedies for misuse helps balance free expression with the need to prevent harm.",
    "Protecting free speech is vital for a healthy democracy, while protecting people from targeted, violent, or dehumanizing attacks is essential for public safety and dignity; reasonable limits should therefore be narrowly defined to prevent imminent harm without silencing legitimate debate. Policies and norms that focus on intent, context, and clear, evidence-based harm thresholds can help bridge concerns about censorship and about allowing abuse.",
    "We can agree that free expression fosters truth-seeking and dissent, yet speech that directly incites violence or systematically degrades vulnerable groups can undermine others' ability to participate equally in society. Creating targeted, transparent restrictions against demonstrable harm\u2014paired with strong protections for open discussion and appeal mechanisms\u2014offers a compromise that respects both freedom and safety.",
    "Balancing free speech and protection from hate involves recognizing the value of open discourse while acknowledging that some forms of targeted, malicious rhetoric cause real-world harm and erosion of equal rights. Limiting only those expressions that are clearly linked to imminent violence, credible threats, or coordinated discrimination, and doing so with clear legal standards and safeguards, can unite advocates on both sides.",
    "Most people value both the freedom to speak and the right to live free from harassment and fear; a shared approach is to allow robust debate but restrict speech that is intentionally threatening, dehumanizing, or likely to produce immediate harm. Emphasizing narrow, transparent rules, education, and restorative responses where possible can help reconcile concerns about censorship and protection.",
    "Finding common ground means defending the principle of open speech while accepting that some hateful expressions\u2014those that pose a clear risk of violence or systematic exclusion\u2014should be constrained. Crafting narrowly tailored, consistently applied limits with due process and emphasis on counter-speech and education can respect civil liberties and human dignity simultaneously.",
    "We can uphold free speech as a cornerstone of democratic life while recognizing that speech intended to incite violence or to systematically marginalize vulnerable groups causes real harm. A shared approach is to protect robust debate and criticism but draw clear, narrowly defined lines around direct threats, incitement, and coordinated harassment to preserve safety and equal participation.",
    "Most people agree that open expression is vital, yet also that words can wound and catalyze violence; bridging these views means protecting broad discourse but limiting speech that directly calls for harm or targets individuals with sustained, abusive campaigns. By focusing restrictions on intent and clear, demonstrable harm rather than unpopular ideas, we can balance liberty and protection.",
    "Respecting free speech and preventing hate-driven harm are both important goals, so a consensus position emphasizes maximal freedom for ideas alongside narrowly tailored prohibitions for threats, incitement, and coordinated dehumanization that foreseeably causes violence or exclusion. This keeps public debate lively while safeguarding vulnerable communities from direct harm.",
    "We can acknowledge the value of free expression while agreeing that it shouldn\u2019t be a shield for speech that intentionally incites violence, promotes discrimination, or facilitates harassment; common ground lies in limiting only those expressions that present a clear, imminent risk to others. Such targeted limits protect both democratic discourse and the basic safety and dignity of marginalized people.",
    "Finding common ground means affirming free speech for discussion and dissent, yet recognizing a legitimate role for constraints when speech moves into explicit threats, calls for violence, or systemic dehumanization with foreseeable harmful effects. Narrow, well-defined restrictions that emphasize intent and likely harm can preserve open debate while preventing real-world damage.",
    "Free speech is a vital democratic value, but it should be balanced with protections that prevent direct harm to individuals and communities. We can agree that clear, narrowly drawn limits\u2014focused on incitement, threats, and conduct that causes measurable harm\u2014help preserve both safety and robust public discourse.",
    "Protecting openness of debate and protecting people from targeted abuse are both important goals, and reasonable policy aims to respect both. By limiting only speech that intentionally incites violence or directly threatens others, we honor free expression while reducing predictable harms to vulnerable groups.",
    "People on different sides agree that free expression matters and that unchecked hostility can damage social cohesion, so a balanced approach is possible. Setting specific, evidence-based boundaries\u2014such as prohibiting threats, harassment, and clear calls to violence\u2014can protect dignity without broadly censoring dissenting views.",
    "Free speech and protection from hate are not mutually exclusive, and most reasonable people support limits where speech causes real, foreseeable harm. Focusing restrictions narrowly on direct incitement, organized harassment, and credible threats can build consensus while maintaining a wide space for debate.",
    "We can bridge concerns about preserving robust dialogue and preventing harm by agreeing that limits should target conduct and intent\u2014such as incitement, explicit threats, and coordinated harassment\u2014rather than unpopular opinions. This approach helps safeguard vulnerable communities while upholding core principles of free expression.",
    "We can uphold the principle of free expression while recognizing that speech intended to incite violence, direct threats, or organized harassment causes real harm and may warrant narrowly defined limits. Any restrictions should be precise, proportionate, and paired with transparent procedures to protect dissent and avoid chilling legitimate debate. This balance respects both dignity and liberty.",
    "Most people want both open discussion and safety from targeted abuse, so a constructive approach is to prohibit only speech that clearly and imminently threatens or coordinates harm, while protecting robust criticism and unpopular ideas. Clear legal standards, independent oversight, and avenues for redress can help prevent overreach and protect vulnerable groups without silencing necessary debate. That common-sense framework can bridge concerns about free speech and harm.",
    "Finding common ground means agreeing that free speech is vital, but not absolute when it causes direct, foreseeable harm such as incitement, credible threats, or persistent harassment. Limits should therefore be narrowly tailored, transparent, and subject to due process so they cannot be used to suppress legitimate dissent. This approach seeks to preserve open discourse while protecting people from serious harm.",
    "We can respect free expression while acknowledging that speech that deliberately targets and endangers individuals or groups may need constrained to protect safety and equality. Any constraints should be clearly defined, proportionate, and accompanied by safeguards to prevent censorship of uncomfortable but lawful ideas. Emphasizing clarity and oversight helps reconcile the value of free speech with the need to prevent harm.",
    "A practical compromise is to defend broad free speech but draw firm, narrowly written lines against speech that intentionally incites violence, organizes harm, or constitutes sustained harassment. Establishing precise legal definitions, independent review, and appeal mechanisms can minimize misuse of restrictions while addressing real harms. This balanced stance aims to protect both expressive freedom and individual safety.",
    "Most of us value free expression while also wanting communities to be safe and dignified; finding common ground means protecting open debate but drawing narrow, well-defined limits where speech directly incites violence or targeted harm. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement, and non\u2011legal responses like education and counseling can help balance liberty with protection, honoring both the need for robust discourse and the need to prevent real harm.",
    "Free speech and respectful coexistence are both important, so a bridge position recognizes broad protections for unpopular ideas while allowing narrowly targeted restrictions on speech that deliberately calls for or reasonably leads to imminent violence or harassment. Emphasizing precise definitions, due process, and community-based remedies helps ensure limits are not used to silence dissent but to prevent tangible harm.",
    "We can agree that free expression is foundational yet not absolute: limits should be minimal, clearly specified, and aimed at preventing direct, imminent harm such as true threats or coordinated harassment campaigns rather than suppressing controversial opinions. Combining legal safeguards with education, counterspeech, and restorative practices offers a balanced way to protect both safety and free debate.",
    "Seeking common ground means acknowledging that free speech fosters democracy while also accepting society has a responsibility to limit speech that intentionally incites violence or targets groups in ways that cause real harm. Any restrictions should be narrowly tailored, transparent, and coupled with non\u2011coercive measures like public education and platform accountability to preserve open dialogue.",
    "People across the spectrum can agree that speech should be free but not a license for violence or systematic harassment; pragmatic limits focus on imminent threats and coordinated abuse rather than policing offensive ideas. Ensuring clear legal standards, proportional enforcement, and investment in counter\u2011speech and community supports helps maintain both freedom and safety.",
    "We can respect the principle of free expression while recognizing that speech intended to incite violence, direct harassment, or cause imminent harm can and should be limited. Limits should be narrowly defined, transparent, and subject to oversight so they protect targeted groups without unduly silencing dissent or unpopular ideas.",
    "Balancing free speech and protection from hate requires acknowledging both the value of open debate and the real damages caused by targeted dehumanization and threats. Reasonable, clearly specified constraints aimed at preventing violence and coordinated abuse\u2014paired with due process and avenues for redress\u2014can bridge concerns across the spectrum.",
    "People across viewpoints can agree that speech that directly threatens safety or organizes harm should not be protected, while broader efforts to combat prejudice should favor education and counter-speech over broad censorship. Any limits should be precise, proportionate, and applied with care to avoid chilling legitimate discourse.",
    "Common ground lies in distinguishing offensive or hateful ideas from speech that causes imminent harm: protecting the former under free expression while restricting the latter to safeguard vulnerable communities. Clear legal tests, transparency, and regular review can help ensure restrictions are targeted and temporary rather than sweeping.",
    "We can uphold robust free speech while agreeing that communication aimed at inciting violence, facilitating discrimination, or enabling harassment crosses a line that society has a duty to define and limit. Such boundaries should be narrowly tailored, evidence-based, and coupled with support for dialogue and restorative approaches.",
    "We can acknowledge that free speech is fundamental while recognizing a shared interest in protecting people from direct, targeted harm; most reasonable parties can agree that speech which intentfully incites violence or organizes harassment crosses a line. Any limits should therefore be narrowly defined, applied transparently, and paired with strong procedural safeguards to avoid chilling legitimate debate.",
    "People on different sides of this debate often value both dignity and open inquiry, so a bridge position is to protect broad expression while prohibiting clear, imminent threats and coordinated campaigns that silence vulnerable groups. Such limits should be precise, evidence-based, and accompanied by avenues for appeal and restorative remedies rather than vague censorship.",
    "Rather than framing this as absolute speech versus total restriction, we can agree to distinguish between offensive ideas\u2014which should be met with counter-speech\u2014and conduct that poses real harms, like targeted threats or calls for violence. Clear, narrowly tailored rules and independent oversight can help balance free expression with safety and mutual respect.",
    "Most people want both a robust marketplace of ideas and safe communities, suggesting limits could focus on speech that directly incites harm or organizes persistent abuse while leaving room for controversial but non-violent views. Coupling narrow prohibitions with transparency, context-sensitive judgment, and educational responses can uphold free speech without endorsing hate-driven harm.",
    "Finding common ground means protecting the right to criticize and offend while agreeing that deliberately dehumanizing, threatening, or violent advocacy should not be tolerated; both free-speech proponents and harm-prevention advocates benefit from rules that are clear and proportionate. Emphasizing counterspeech, education, and fair enforcement helps maintain open debate without enabling targeted abuse.",
    "Free speech is essential to a healthy democracy, but most people can agree it should not be a shield for expression that intentionally incites violence or causes direct, demonstrable harm to others. Pragmatic limits\u2014narrowly defined, transparently applied, and paired with due process\u2014can protect safety and dignity while preserving vigorous debate.",
    "While defending open discussion, we can find common ground in rejecting speech that targets people to threaten, dehumanize, or provoke immediate harm. Reasonable, proportionate rules that focus on intent and imminent danger, rather than mere offense, help balance free expression with protecting vulnerable communities.",
    "Free expression and protection from hate need not be in opposition: most agree that debate should be robust but not a cover for harassment, intimidation, or calls to violence. Focusing limits on direct, harmful conduct and supporting counterspeech and education offers a balanced approach that respects civil liberties and public safety.",
    "People across the spectrum can support rules that preserve the marketplace of ideas while preventing speech that foreseeably leads to harm or discrimination. Clear, narrowly tailored standards\u2014applied with transparency and avenues for appeal\u2014can reconcile the value of free speech with the need to protect individual rights and social cohesion.",
    "Most reasonable viewpoints converge on the idea that free speech should be broad but not absolute when it crosses into targeted threats, coordinated harassment, or calls for violence. Developing precise, legally sound limits and investing in education and community norms can bridge concerns about censorship and safety.",
    "We can honor both the value of free expression and the need to protect people from targeted harm by agreeing that limits should be narrow, clear, and focused on direct incitement, credible threats, and coordinated harassment. Such boundaries should be legally defined, subject to oversight, and supplemented by education and robust counter-speech to preserve open debate while reducing real-world damage.",
    "Most people want a society where ideas can be challenged but individuals are not exposed to violence or dehumanizing attacks; a common path is to prohibit speech that intentionally and imminently causes harm while defending broad protections for unpopular opinions. Complementing legal limits with community norms and restorative approaches helps balance safety with the freedoms that sustain democratic discourse.",
    "Finding common ground means recognizing that free speech is vital but not absolute: reasonable, narrowly tailored laws against direct threats, coordination of violence, and sustained harassment can coexist with strong protections for political and artistic expression. Transparency, judicial review, and opportunities for appeal help ensure limits do not become tools for unjust suppression.",
    "People across the spectrum usually agree that speech intended to incite imminent violence or to target individuals with credible threats should be restricted, while allowing vigorous debate and even offensive ideas to be contested through counter-speech. Combining limited legal restrictions with education, platform responsibility, and civic dialogue can protect vulnerable groups without unduly curbing freedom of expression.",
    "We can bridge differing views by upholding free expression as a cornerstone of democracy while accepting narrowly drawn limits on hate that directly causes harm or silences others, enforced with clear standards and independent oversight. Emphasizing prevention, support for victims, and public discourse as remedies maintains both liberty and safety.",
    "We can uphold a strong commitment to free expression while acknowledging a shared interest in preventing speech that directly incites violence or targets individuals with sustained, dehumanizing harassment; limits should be narrowly defined, transparent, and subject to independent review. By focusing on clear harms, intent, and imminence rather than broad labels, societies can protect open debate and vulnerable people at the same time.",
    "Most people want both robust debate and safe, inclusive communities, so a useful bridge is to protect speech broadly but place carefully drawn restrictions on threats, direct calls to violence, and coordinated campaigns that silence or endanger others. Those restrictions should be proportionate, clearly articulated, and include procedural safeguards like appeal and oversight.",
    "Free speech and dignity are both important, and common ground can be found by allowing wide-ranging expression while prohibiting narrowly defined acts\u2014such as credible threats, targeted harassment, or incitement to imminent lawless action\u2014that cause real, demonstrable harm. Combining legal limits with education and community norms helps maintain openness without normalizing harm.",
    "We can agree that speech should usually be free to challenge ideas, yet not be a shield for intentionally violent or systematically abusive conduct that undermines others\u2019 safety and equal participation; limits should therefore be precise, evidence-based, and applied with due process. Emphasizing prevention, remediation, and dialogue alongside narrow legal boundaries can satisfy both civil liberties and public safety concerns.",
    "Balancing liberty and protection means accepting that free speech is vital but not absolute: reasonable, narrowly tailored constraints on speech that deliberately incites violence or orchestrates sustained targeting can protect people without unduly silencing debate. Transparent rules, clear definitions of harm and intent, and fair enforcement create common ground for diverse viewpoints.",
    "We can uphold the principle of free expression while agreeing that speech intended to provoke imminent violence or directed at identifiable groups in a way that causes real-world harm should be constrained. Any limits should be narrowly defined, transparent, and paired with clear legal standards so that they protect safety without silencing legitimate debate. This approach balances individual liberties with the duty to prevent harm.",
    "Most people want both freedom of speech and protection from targeted abuse, so a common-sense bridge is to protect broad discussion while restricting direct threats, calls to violence, and coordinated harassment. Limits should focus on intent and likely consequence rather than suppressing unpopular or offensive ideas. Safeguards like appeal mechanisms and oversight can help maintain fairness.",
    "We can acknowledge that free speech is fundamental while recognizing that speech that deliberately incites imminent harm or systematically degrades specific groups undermines the conditions for equal civic participation. Therefore, any restrictions should be narrow, evidence-based, and aimed at preventing tangible harm rather than policing thought. Coupling limited legal tools with education and counter-speech preserves both safety and open debate.",
    "A practical compromise is to keep the bar for restricting speech high\u2014focused on clear, imminent danger or targeted, malicious harassment\u2014while defending robust protections for controversial but nonviolent expression. This lets societies address real harms without chilling dissent or minority viewpoints. Transparent standards and independent review can build trust across differing perspectives.",
    "Balancing free speech and protection from hate involves drawing narrow, precise lines around speech that directly threatens safety or facilitates discrimination, while preserving space for heated or offensive debate that does not cause immediate harm. Emphasizing intent, context, and outcome in any limits helps avoid overreach. Complementary measures\u2014education, community norms, and remedies for victims\u2014can reinforce a fair equilibrium.",
    "We can uphold free expression while agreeing that speech intended to incite violence or directly threaten individuals should be limited; protecting people from imminent harm doesn't negate the value of debate. Clear, narrowly defined laws focused on intent and outcome rather than offense can bridge free-speech advocates and those seeking protection from hate.",
    "Free speech is vital for democratic discourse, yet most people also accept boundaries when words actively promote violence or targeted harassment. By defining limits around direct threats and coordinated dehumanization while preserving robust debate, we can protect vulnerable groups without silencing legitimate dissent.",
    "A common-ground approach recognizes both the importance of open discussion and the real harms hate speech can cause; limits should therefore focus on speech that reasonably and imminently risks violence or discrimination. Oversight should be transparent, narrowly tailored, and subject to appeal to avoid creeping censorship.",
    "Rather than a blanket rule, we can agree that speech crossing into credible threats, incitement, or organized harassment warrants restriction, while protecting controversial or offensive ideas that don't cause direct harm. Balancing narrowly defined legal standards with strong free-speech protections and community-based responses can satisfy both safety and freedom concerns.",
    "Most people value freedom of expression but also want protection from speech that meaningfully endangers others; the compromise is to restrict explicit incitement, credible threats, and targeted campaigns that silence people through fear. Coupling precise legal limits with education and counter-speech allows society to confront hate without undermining open debate.",
    "We can respect the value of free expression while recognizing that speech intended to and likely to cause immediate harm\u2014such as direct threats, incitement to violence, or targeted harassment\u2014may warrant narrowly defined limits. Any restrictions should be clear, proportionate, and paired with transparent oversight and avenues for appeal so that protection against harm does not become a blanket curb on legitimate debate.",
    "Most people want both robust debate and safe communities, so a sensible middle ground is to protect open discourse but prohibit speech that directly incites violence, organizes discrimination, or constitutes targeted, sustained harassment. Such limits should be applied narrowly, guided by evidence of harm, and complemented by education and support for vulnerable groups.",
    "Free speech and human dignity are not mutually exclusive, and many can agree that restrictions are justified when language crosses into clear threats, imminent calls to violence, or coordinated dehumanization that enables abuse. To preserve trust across viewpoints, those restrictions must be precisely defined, legally consistent, and subject to independent review.",
    "A practical compromise is to favor counter-speech, dialogue, and community norms as the first response to hateful ideas while reserving legal or platform limits for speech that poses a real, immediate risk of harm or incites criminal acts. That approach balances the harms of silencing with the harms of letting dangerous speech go unchecked, and it requires clear standards and fair enforcement.",
    "People across the spectrum can agree that unrestricted hate that leads to violence or systematic exclusion should not be tolerated, yet any limits should be narrowly targeted, transparent, and accompanied by remedies like education and support for those affected. This allows protection from tangible harm without needlessly stifling legitimate, even uncomfortable, public debate.",
    "We can agree that free speech is a fundamental value while also recognizing that speech which intentionally degrades, threatens, or incites harm against people undermines the safety and dignity of others. Reasonable limits should therefore focus narrowly on direct harm\u2014such as credible threats, targeted harassment, or calls to violence\u2014while preserving robust debate and dissent. By centering rules on clear harms rather than vague offense, we can protect both liberty and vulnerable communities.",
    "Most people value both the freedom to express ideas and the right to live free from violence and discrimination, so a shared approach is to restrict speech that directly incites violence or constitutes targeted harassment. At the same time, broad protections for controversial or unpopular opinions help prevent censorship and preserve democratic discourse. Balancing clear, narrowly defined limits against mechanisms for accountability and education can unite concerns for safety and free expression.",
    "We can find common ground by distinguishing between hurtful rhetoric and speech that poses a real risk of harm: protect open debate but limit communication that threatens, organizes violence, or systematically silences marginalized groups. Limits should be precise, evidence-based, and subject to due process to avoid overreach and preserve trust in institutions. Combining legal safeguards with community standards and counter-speech supports both dignity and freedom.",
    "It\u2019s possible to uphold free speech while recognizing that some forms of expression\u2014such as explicit calls for violence or targeted, repetitive harassment\u2014warrant restriction because they endanger others. Any constraints should be narrowly tailored, transparent, and aimed at preventing tangible harm rather than policing discomfort or unpopular views. Emphasizing clarity and proportionality can help bridge perspectives on liberty and protection.",
    "People on different sides of this debate often agree on two points: free speech is vital, and no one should be subjected to threats or organized abuse; a compromise is to limit speech that directly incites harm or constitutes sustained, targeted abuse while preserving room for robust, even offensive, debate. Clear criteria and procedural safeguards are essential so limits aren\u2019t misused to silence dissent. This approach balances individual safety with commitment to open discourse.",
    "We can uphold free expression while recognizing that speech intended to incite violence, constitute credible threats, or enable targeted harassment causes real harm and may warrant narrow, clearly defined limits. Any restrictions should be proportionate, applied through transparent legal or institutional processes, and paired with robust protections for open debate and remedies like counterspeech and education.",
    "Respecting both the value of free speech and the dignity of vulnerable groups is possible by distinguishing protected expression from conduct that directly endangers others, such as incitement, threats, or organized dehumanization. Crafting narrowly tailored rules with judicial oversight and meaningful appeals can build common ground between those who fear censorship and those who fear harm.",
    "Most people want lively public debate without allowing language that intentionally targets people to intimidate or deprive them of rights, so a useful compromise is to protect broad discourse while limiting speech with clear intent, imminence, and likelihood of causing harm. Complementing any legal limits with education, restorative measures, and platform transparency helps prevent overreach and preserves democratic conversation.",
    "Free speech and protection from hate-fueled harm are both legitimate social goals, and bridging them means drawing limits only where speech becomes actionable harm\u2014threats, credible incitement, or systematic harassment\u2014while ensuring any controls are specific, proportional, and subject to review. Emphasizing non-punitive responses like counterspeech, support for targeted communities, and clear enforcement standards can reduce conflict between viewpoints.",
    "A pragmatic middle ground accepts that expression deserves wide latitude but not a shield for speech that causes imminent violence, coordinated exclusion, or targeted intimidation; limits should be narrowly defined, evidence-based, and implemented with due process. Strengthening civic education, platform accountability, and remedies for victims helps reconcile commitments to free inquiry and to protecting vulnerable people.",
    "Free speech is a foundational value, but most people agree it should not be a shield for direct threats, incitement to violence, or targeted harassment that undermines others' safety and equal participation. Establishing narrow, clear limits on speech that causes imminent harm while protecting open debate and robust dissent can help balance individual liberty with community protection.",
    "We can respect the principle of free expression while also recognizing that language which intentionally incites violence or systematically degrades marginalized groups often causes real-world harm. A shared approach is to limit only narrowly defined, demonstrably harmful acts\u2014such as credible threats and direct calls to violence\u2014while using counter-speech, education, and due process to address broader grievances.",
    "Supporters of absolute free speech and advocates for stricter restrictions both want a society where people can live with dignity and safety, so common ground lies in distinguishing between offensive ideas and speech that poses an imminent risk of harm. Laws and policies should therefore be narrowly tailored to prevent direct violence, threats, and coordinated harassment, while preserving space for criticism and disagreement.",
    "Balancing free speech and protection from hate requires recognizing the value of open discourse and the need to prevent speech that directly endangers or silences others. Agreeing on limits that target imminent threats, coordinated harassment, and clear incitement\u2014rather than unpopular or offensive opinions\u2014can bridge competing concerns.",
    "Most people on different sides of the debate can accept that freedom of expression is vital but not absolute, and that narrowly defined constraints on speech that directly incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or systematically harasses individuals are reasonable. Emphasizing transparency, clear legal standards, and remedies like counter-speech and education helps protect free debate while reducing harm to vulnerable communities.",
    "Most people value both free expression and the safety and dignity of individuals, so limits should be narrowly drawn to prohibit direct calls for violence, targeted threats, or coordinated harassment while preserving robust debate. Law and platform policy can focus on clear, objective harms and on remedies like removal, counterspeech, and education rather than broad censorship. This approach seeks a balance that protects vulnerable people without unduly chilling legitimate discussion.",
    "We can bridge differing views by agreeing that free speech is essential but not absolute: deliberate incitement of imminent violence and direct, targeted threats should be disallowed, while offensive or unpopular ideas should be met with counterargument. Transparent, proportionate rules and due process on platforms and in law help ensure limits are applied fairly. Emphasizing education and restorative responses furthers social cohesion without silencing dissent.",
    "Finding common ground means protecting open debate alongside protecting people from serious harm; reasonable limits should therefore target speech that intentionally causes or imminently risks violence, severe harassment, or the denial of others\u2019 rights. Outside those narrow categories, the preferred tools are counterspeech, transparency, and context-sensitive moderation. That balance respects both liberty and human dignity.",
    "Many agree that free expression and community safety are both important, so a shared approach is to outlaw narrowly defined harms\u2014such as direct threats, incitement, and coordinated campaigns to silence or terrorize\u2014while upholding broad protections for debate and criticism. Clear definitions, oversight, and avenues for appeal reduce abuse of restrictions. Investing in media literacy and restorative practices helps address the roots of hateful speech without sweeping bans.",
    "A constructive compromise recognizes that free speech serves truth-seeking but does not justify intentional, imminent harm: limits should therefore apply to speech that poses a clear, direct threat or is part of organized harassment, with remedies that are proportionate and transparent. Prefer voluntary community standards, targeted enforcement, and remedies that restore safety and dignity. This approach aims to preserve open discourse while protecting vulnerable people.",
    "Free expression is essential for democratic society, but it should coexist with protections that prevent serious harm; recognizing both values can guide realistic limits on speech that directly incites violence, threats, or targeted harassment. By focusing restrictions narrowly on conduct and demonstrable harm\u2014while preserving robust debate and clear, transparent rules\u2014we can respect individual liberties and protect vulnerable communities.",
    "Most people agree that free speech is vital but not absolute, and common ground can be found by distinguishing offensive ideas from speech that intentionally incites violence or silences others through sustained harassment. Setting narrow, well-defined limits on direct threats and coordinated abuse, combined with safeguards for legitimate criticism and open dialogue, balances freedom with safety.",
    "We can bridge differing views by affirming a shared commitment to free inquiry while acknowledging that speech which directly threatens safety or deliberately targets and dehumanizes individuals may warrant restriction. Emphasizing precise legal standards, transparent enforcement, and avenues for redress helps protect both expressive freedom and the dignity of those harmed.",
    "Respecting free speech and preventing harm are complementary goals, and agreement is possible by concentrating limits on speech that poses clear, imminent danger\u2014such as calls to violence, credible threats, or persistent doxxing\u2014rather than broadly censoring unpopular or offensive opinions. Coupling such limits with procedural safeguards and education about respectful discourse can maintain open debate while reducing real-world harms.",
    "People across the spectrum can agree that freedom of expression deserves robust protection but not at the cost of permitting speech that intentionally inflicts harm or mobilizes violence against people. Crafting narrowly tailored restrictions on direct threats, incitement, and coordinated harassment, alongside transparent rules and appeals, preserves both liberty and community safety.",
    "We can uphold free expression while also acknowledging that speech causing direct harm to vulnerable groups may justify narrowly defined limits; focusing on intent, context, and demonstrable harm helps find common ground. At the same time, promoting counter-speech, education, and nonpunitive remedies preserves open debate and protects those targeted.",
    "Many agree that free speech is vital, yet few support unchecked harassment that incites violence or denies safety; setting narrowly tailored limits on direct incitement and threats can balance both concerns. Emphasizing transparency, clear legal standards, and robust platforms for dissent can bridge principles of liberty and protection.",
    "A shared approach acknowledges both the value of free expression and the need to protect people from speech that directly incites violence or ongoing discrimination; limits should be specific, evidence-based, and subject to oversight. Encouraging community norms, education, and alternatives to censorship can help preserve open discourse while reducing harm.",
    "We can seek common ground by distinguishing between offensive ideas and speech that poses a real, demonstrable risk to safety or rights, allowing narrow restrictions only where harm is clear and proportionate. Combining legal safeguards with strong support for counter-speech and inclusion helps protect vulnerable groups without eroding free debate.",
    "Balancing free speech and protection from hate requires rules that target clear, imminent harms\u2014such as direct threats or organized incitement\u2014while avoiding broad bans on unpopular opinions. Pairing precise legal limits with investments in education, restorative practices, and public dialogue can unite defenders of liberty and advocates for dignity.",
    "Most of us want both the freedom to speak and the safety to live without targeted harm, so sensible limits should focus narrowly on direct incitement to violence, true threats, and coordinated harassment rather than broad ideological censorship. Clear, transparent standards and fair appeals processes can help protect free expression while preventing speech that causes imminent, demonstrable harm. By combining legal safeguards with education and counter-speech, we can uphold open debate and protect vulnerable communities.",
    "People across the spectrum agree that speech that deliberately provokes violence or silences others by threats deserves restriction, while ordinary offensive or unpopular ideas are best countered by more speech. Limiting only narrowly defined, imminent harm allows societies to preserve robust debate, protect democratic participation, and avoid overbroad censorship. Emphasizing due process, clear definitions, and restorative options can bridge concerns about both safety and liberty.",
    "We can find common ground by recognizing a shared commitment to free inquiry alongside a commitment to protect individuals from targeted, harmful conduct: limits should address imminent lawless action, credible threats, and sustained harassment but not shield hateful ideas from rebuttal. Policies should be precise, proportionate, and accompanied by transparent enforcement and appeals so they don\u2019t become tools for political suppression. Supporting education and counter-speech strengthens resilience to hateful rhetoric without eroding fundamental freedoms.",
    "Most people want speech that challenges ideas to flourish while preventing speech that directly endangers others, so a balanced approach restricts only direct threats, incitement, and coordinated deplatforming of vulnerable groups. Legal and platform rules should be narrowly tailored and paired with oversight, appeal rights, and efforts to promote dialogue and media literacy. That way we protect both public safety and the marketplace of ideas.",
    "Bridging the divide means accepting that free speech is vital but not absolute: limits should be narrowly drawn to stop imminent violence and targeted harassment, not to ban offensive or unpopular opinions. Clear definitions, transparency, and proportional remedies help ensure rules protect people without stifling legitimate debate. Combining legal safeguards with education and support for marginalized voices helps reconcile the values of liberty and dignity.",
    "We can uphold free expression as a foundational value while recognizing that speech intended to incite violence or facilitate direct harm should be limited; narrowly tailored rules that target intent and imminent risk can protect safety without sweeping censorship. Emphasizing clear standards, due process, and education will help build trust between those who worry about repression and those who fear real-world harm.",
    "Most people value open debate yet worry when words become tools of harassment or mobilize violence; agreeing on precise, evidence-based thresholds for prohibition\u2014such as direct threats, incitement, and targeted harassment\u2014can bridge those concerns. Coupling such limits with robust avenues for appeal and support for counter-speech preserves democratic expression while mitigating harm.",

By focusing on clear, evidence-based criteria and transparent review, differing perspectives can agree on rules that protect both safety and speech.",
    "Free speech is vital, yet it should not be a shield for speech that intentionally incites violence or systematically targets vulnerable groups; modest, well-defined restrictions focused on intent and likely harm can protect public safety without silencing legitimate discourse. Agreed standards, oversight, and avenues for appeal can bridge concerns from both civil liberties advocates and those seeking protection from abuse.",
    "A common-ground approach recognizes that speech deserving protection differs from speech that poses a real, imminent risk to others; limits should therefore be narrowly drawn to address direct threats, harassment, and coordinated harm while avoiding vague bans on unpopular ideas. Centering definitions on harm, context, and intent allows policymakers from across the spectrum to craft rules that minimize abuse and preserve open debate.",
    "People who value liberty and those worried about the effects of hate can agree on targeted constraints: prohibit speech that reasonably and directly leads to violence or severe, targeted harassment, but avoid sweeping rules that stifle dissent or unpopular opinions. Transparent processes, clear legal standards, and regular review can help balance rights and protections in a democratic society.",
    "The debate need not be zero-sum: free expression should be upheld, yet societies can limit speech when it crosses into credible incitement, direct threats, or sustained targeted dehumanization that causes tangible harm. By adopting precise definitions, proportional remedies, and procedural safeguards, communities can address harms while respecting diverse viewpoints.",
    "We can uphold free expression while agreeing that speech intended to incite violence, direct threats, or coordinated harassment should be limited to protect people's safety and equal participation in public life. Any restrictions should be narrowly defined, subject to due process, and accompanied by robust counter-speech, education, and support for affected communities.",
    "Respecting both free speech and human dignity means finding a middle ground: protect open debate and uncomfortable ideas, but draw clear lines against speech that deliberately aims to harm, intimidate, or mobilize violence against targeted groups. Those limits should be transparent, narrowly tailored, and paired with remedies that reinforce social cohesion rather than suppress dissent.",
    "Most people agree that free speech is essential to democracy yet should not serve as a license for threats, incitement, or organized harassment that endanger others; therefore narrow, well-defined legal limits coupled with nonlegal responses like education and counter-speech are a practical compromise. Emphasizing clear standards and oversight helps balance protection of expression with protection of vulnerable communities.",
    "A constructive approach recognizes the value of robust expression while accepting limited constraints on hate speech that poses an imminent risk of violence or systematic exclusion; these constraints must be precise, proportionate, and enforceable through fair procedures. Alongside legal measures, communities should invest in dialogue, restorative practices, and media literacy to reduce harm without chilling legitimate debate.",
    "Finding common ground means affirming free speech as a principle but also agreeing that society should act against speech that intentionally silences, threatens, or mobilizes harm against vulnerable groups; any such limits ought to be narrowly scoped, transparently applied, and subject to regular review. Complementary tools\u2014education, transparent platforms, and support for victims\u2014can address harms without unduly restricting open discourse.",
    "Free speech is a foundational value that protects open debate, while preventing harm to targeted groups is also an essential public interest. We can bridge these principles by narrowly limiting speech that directly incites violence, credible threats, or coordinated harassment, while preserving robust protections for controversial but nonviolent expression. Reasonable, clearly defined rules and transparent enforcement can help balance liberty and safety without silencing legitimate dissent.",
    "Most people on all sides value both the right to speak freely and the dignity and safety of vulnerable communities.

Clear, narrowly tailored standards and independent oversight can respect free expression while reducing abuse.",
    "Free expression and protections against hateful harm need not be opposites; they can be reconciled by distinguishing between offensive ideas and conduct that reasonably risks bodily harm or severe targeted intimidation. Agreeing to restrict only narrowly defined incitement, credible threats, and organized harassment lets societies preserve open debate while protecting individuals. Emphasizing due process and transparent rules helps build trust across differing viewpoints.",
    "Defending free speech and preventing hateful harm are both legitimate concerns, and common ground lies in limiting speech that directly endangers others while safeguarding vigorous public discourse. That means prohibiting explicit calls to violence, imminent threats, and sustained targeted harassment, but resisting broad bans on unpopular or offensive viewpoints. Crafting precise legal standards and accountability mechanisms can reconcile these aims in pluralistic societies.",
    "People who prioritize liberty and those who prioritize safety can agree that not all speech is equal: expressions that directly incite violence or constitute credible threats warrant restriction, while nonviolent but offensive speech should typically be countered by counter-speech rather than censorship. Narrow, transparent limits focused on preventing real harm, along with strong protections for debate and dissent, offer a workable compromise. Emphasizing education and community norms alongside legal safeguards can further bridge divides.",

    "Many agree that free speech is essential, but it should not be a shield for speech that causes imminent physical harm or organizes discrimination; finding common ground means distinguishing between offensive ideas and criminal acts. Laws and platform policies should therefore focus on intent, context, and demonstrable harm, coupled with transparency and appeal mechanisms.",
    "A balanced approach accepts robust debate while preventing targeted harassment or dehumanization that undermines the dignity and safety of individuals and communities; both values\u2014liberty and protection\u2014are worth defending. Practical limits should be narrowly tailored, clearly defined, and accompanied by non-legal responses like education and community standards.",
    "We can bridge the divide by agreeing that speech only becomes unacceptable when it crosses into direct threats, incitement of violence, or coordinated discrimination, rather than merely causing offense; this preserves freedom while protecting people. Establishing clear criteria, transparent enforcement, and opportunities for redress can help maintain trust across differing viewpoints.",
    "Recognizing free speech as foundational, most reasonable people also accept some constraints where words are used to plan violence or strip others of basic rights; the challenge is to set limits that are specific and proportionate.

    "Rather than framing the issue as absolute permission versus total bans, we can agree on a balance: protect open discourse and dissent, but limit speech that is intentionally violent, imminently harmful, or part of sustained campaigns to dehumanize or exclude people. Ensuring any restrictions are narrowly tailored, transparent, and subject to review helps reconcile free-speech values with the need to safeguard vulnerable communities.",
    "Most perspectives converge on protecting both freedom of expression and individuals\u2019 safety, so a pragmatic approach is to defend broad free-speech rights while allowing targeted limits on speech that directly calls for violence, constitutes specific credible threats, or amounts to organized incitement to discrimination. Complementing legal limits with robust counter-speech and remedies that encourage dialogue helps preserve open exchange without condoning harm.",
    "We can bridge differences by recognizing that free speech and human dignity are both important: uphold wide latitude for debate and criticism, but prohibit narrowly defined harms such as credible threats, direct incitement, and systematic campaigns of harassment that strip people of safety and rights. Grounding any restrictions in clear definitions, intent, and proportional remedies keeps the focus on preventing real-world harm rather than suppressing unpopular ideas.",

    "Most people value both liberty and dignity, suggesting a compromise where hate speech is addressed when it crosses into targeted incitement, harassment, or discrimination that causes tangible harm, but is not broadly used to suppress unpopular or offensive opinions. Emphasizing precision, transparency, and remedies that include education and restorative approaches can win support across viewpoints.",
    "We can find agreement by insisting limits on speech be specific, narrowly tailored to prevent imminent harm or coordinated harassment, and applied with safeguards against abuse, while trusting counter-speech, community norms, and civic institutions to challenge hateful ideas. This balances the value of open discourse with the responsibility to protect people from real-world harm.",
    "Free speech and protection from dehumanizing, violence-provoking rhetoric both matter, so a sensible middle path is to prohibit direct threats and targeted calls for harm while resisting broad bans on offensive but non-threatening expression, and to invest in education and public rebuttal. Such an approach respects democratic dialogue while reducing the most dangerous consequences of hate.",
    "We can uphold the principle of free expression while agreeing that speech which intentionally and imminently incites violence or targets individuals with coordinated harassment should be limited; clear legal standards and due process can protect against abuse of those limits. By focusing restrictions narrowly on demonstrable harm and preserving robust debate, we can balance safety and liberty in a way that many perspectives can accept.",
    "Free speech is essential to democracy, yet most people also want safeguards against speech that directly threatens people\u2019s safety or denies the dignity of vulnerable groups; setting narrowly defined, transparent limits on incitement and targeted threats can reflect both concerns. Emphasizing education, counter-speech, and consistent enforcement helps build trust across viewpoints while minimizing overreach.",
    "Rather than an absolute or unlimited right, many find common ground in protecting open discussion while prohibiting clear, actionable harms\u2014such as direct calls for violence or organized campaigns of harassment\u2014under narrowly tailored laws and platform policies. Combining legal clarity, procedural safeguards, and avenues for rebuttal can respect free expression while reducing real-world damage.",
    "People on different sides of this issue can agree that speech that poses a real, immediate danger to others should not be protected, even as we resist vague or broad restrictions that chill debate; defining prohibited speech narrowly and applying rules transparently helps reconcile safety with liberty. Investing in community standards, education, and remedies for harm creates a pragmatic bridge between values of free speech and protections for targeted groups.",
    "Common ground exists in recognizing both the vital role of free expression and the need to prevent speech that predictably causes violence or systematic dehumanization of individuals; limits should therefore be specific, proportionate, and subject to oversight to prevent abuse. Prioritizing clear definitions, due process, and nonlegal responses like counter-speech can satisfy concerns from multiple perspectives.",
    "Most people agree that free expression is vital, but also that speech which intentionally incites violence or targeted harassment deserves distinct limits. A fair approach balances protecting open debate with clear, narrowly defined rules and due process to address genuine harms.",
    "Free speech and protection from harm are both important values, and common ground lies in restricting only speech that directly and intentionally threatens safety or facilitates violence. Any limits should be precise, evidence-based, and applied with transparency to preserve democratic dialogue.",
    "While individuals vary on where to draw the line, many can agree that speech meant to provoke violence or systematically demean a vulnerable group crosses into harm that society has reason to regulate. Limiting such conduct, rather than unpopular ideas, while safeguarding procedural rights, can reconcile free expression with dignity and safety.",

Combining narrow legal limits with strong counter-speech, education, and platform accountability can bridge concerns on both sides.",
    "Most people can agree that speech protected by the principle of free expression should be limited only when it presents a clear, imminent risk of serious harm, such as direct incitement to violence or coordinated harassment. Crafting precise, transparent standards and enforcing them equitably helps uphold both safety and free debate.",
    "Acknowledging both the value of open discourse and the real harms of hate, we should aim for measures that stop targeted threats and persistent dehumanization while avoiding broad censorship of unpopular opinions. Platforms, lawmakers, and communities can prioritize proportional, transparent responses and remedies for harm. This shared approach balances free speech with protecting people's dignity and democratic participation.",
    "Finding common ground means affirming free inquiry while recognizing that speech causing imminent violence or systematic exclusion should not be tolerated. Limits, if any, ought to be minimal, precisely defined, and accompanied by robust procedural safeguards and avenues for counter-speech.",
    "Many people value both the freedom to express ideas and the need to protect people from harm, so a balanced approach looks for narrow, clearly defined limits on speech that directly incites violence or constitutes targeted threats while preserving robust debate and artistic expression. Clear legal standards, transparent enforcement, and avenues for appeal can help ensure limits are not abused. At the same time, investing in education and counter-speech strengthens community resilience without resorting to overbroad censorship.",
    "We can bridge differing views by affirming a shared commitment to dignity and open inquiry: free speech should be broad, but not a license for deliberate dehumanization or organized calls to violence. Limits should therefore be precise, focused on imminent harm or unlawful harassment, and paired with due process and oversight. Encouraging counterspeech, restorative remedies, and public education can address harms without unduly shrinking legitimate discourse.",
    "No one wants to silence genuine debate or allow unchecked abuse, so a common-sense compromise is to prohibit speech that intentionally and imminently incites violence or constitutes direct threats while protecting political, artistic, and academic expression. These prohibitions should be narrowly tailored, clearly defined, and subject to independent review to prevent mission creep. Complementing legal limits with community norms and counterspeech promotes safety and pluralism together.",
    "Balancing free speech with harm reduction means accepting very limited restrictions where speech poses a clear, imminent danger\u2014such as direct incitement, targeted harassment, or true threats\u2014but resisting broad bans on offensive ideas or unpopular opinions. Safeguards like precise definitions, transparent processes, and appeal rights help protect free expression from overreach. Simultaneously, promoting education and alternative remedies reinforces a healthy marketplace of ideas without defaulting to censorship.",
    "Finding common ground starts from the premise that rights carry responsibilities: speech should remain free to challenge and provoke, yet not function as a tool for violence or systematic persecution, so limits should be narrowly confined to clear incitement, threats, and unlawful harassment. Such limits must be applied transparently with safeguards against abuse, while non-legal responses like counterspeech and support for affected communities address broader harms. This mix respects both the value of expression and the need to protect vulnerable people.",

That suggests permitting broad expression but restricting speech that is a clear, imminent threat or coordinated harassment, with transparent rules and remedies like counterspeech and restorative processes.",
    "We can acknowledge that free speech deserves strong protection while also recognizing that deliberately violent or dehumanizing speech that predictably leads to harm should be constrained. Crafting narrow, evidence-based limits, enforced with safeguards and emphasis on prevention and education, helps reconcile civil liberties with community safety.",
    "We can agree that free expression is vital to a healthy society while also recognizing that speech which directly incites violence, threats, or targeted harassment undermines others' safety and civic participation. Reasonable limits should therefore focus narrowly on preventing clear harm, coupled with education and community norms that promote respectful dialogue rather than broad bans that chill legitimate debate.",
    "Both defenders of free speech and those concerned about hate recognize the need to protect individuals from harm without eroding open discourse. A bridging approach limits only speech that intentionally and imminently causes violence or targeted harm, while investing in counter-speech, education, and transparent legal standards to address gray areas.",
    "We can find common ground by upholding free speech as a core value but accepting narrow, well-defined restrictions on expressions that amount to direct threats, incitement, or coordinated harassment. Alongside those limits, fostering civic education, robust counter-speech, and fair enforcement helps protect vulnerable groups without silencing legitimate dissent.",
    "Free speech and protection from hate need not be mutually exclusive: most people support open debate but reject speech that concretely endangers others. Practical limits should therefore target clear incitement, credible threats, and sustained targeted abuse, while promoting remedies like public education and community standards to reduce harm without overbroad censorship.",

Clear, transparent rules and avenues for redress can balance freedom of expression with preventing harm.",
    "People across the spectrum value freedom of expression but differ on where insult ends and danger begins; a bridge is to confine limits to speech that poses a concrete, imminent risk or constitutes targeted harassment, while safeguarding robust criticism and dissent. Policies should be narrowly tailored, legally precise, and paired with education and support for affected communities.",
    "We should affirm free speech as a cornerstone while acknowledging that unchecked hate speech can erode social trust and safety; therefore, limits that focus on direct threats, targeted harassment, and organized incitement are more likely to win broad support. Ensuring due process, transparency, and mechanisms for contesting decisions will help maintain legitimacy and prevent abuse.",
    "A constructive approach recognizes both the need to defend free expression and the duty to prevent speech that intentionally harms or mobilizes violence against groups; reasonable, narrowly drawn restrictions accompanied by clear definitions and independent oversight can reconcile these aims.

Limits should be precise and focused on speech that poses a clear risk of harm, such as direct threats or coordinated harassment. Alongside narrow legal constraints, investment in education and counter-speech preserves robust debate while protecting rights.",
    "Most people agree that debate and dissent must be protected, but also that speech intentionally designed to intimidate or spur violence should not go unchecked. Crafting narrowly defined legal boundaries, backed by fair procedures and proportional sanctions, can help prevent abuse without chilling legitimate expression. Encouraging civic education and platforms for alternative viewpoints further narrows the gap between liberty and safety.",
    "We can find common ground by distinguishing offensive or hateful opinion from speech that directly threatens people's safety or their equal participation in society. Limits, if any, should be narrowly drawn, evidence-based, and applied with due process to avoid overreach. Supporting non-legal responses like community standards and robust counter-speech preserves open debate while protecting vulnerable groups.",
    "Free expression is a vital democratic value, but it should not be a shield for direct threats, incitement to violence, or coordinated harassment that undermines others' safety and equal participation. Reasonable, narrowly defined limits combined with clear procedures and emphasis on education and counter-speech can protect vulnerable people while preserving robust debate.",
    "Most people agree that speech should be free but not a license to harm others; narrowly targeted prohibitions on calls for violence, credible threats, and organized campaigns of dehumanization can reflect that balance.

Those limits must be tightly tailored, transparent, and paired with non\u2011coercive measures like education and open rebuttal to preserve space for legitimate dissent.",
    "A constructive middle ground acknowledges the importance of free speech while accepting that speech which is intentionally designed and likely to produce immediate violence or targeted abuse should be restricted. Any such restrictions should be narrowly drawn, applied with due process, and complemented by policies that promote dialogue, media literacy, and protections for vulnerable groups to reduce the need for censorship.",
    "We can uphold the value of free expression while also recognizing a shared interest in protecting people from direct harm; most agree that speech that intentionally incites violence or targets individuals with credible threats should not be tolerated. Focusing on narrowly defined, evidence-based limits preserves open debate while ensuring vulnerable communities are not exposed to real-world danger.",

Grounding limits in clear, specific harms helps bridge those who prioritize liberty and those who emphasize safety.",
    "Most people on different sides of this issue want both lively public discussion and safe communities, so a practical compromise is to protect broad, even offensive debate while restricting targeted threats, coordinated harassment, and direct calls for violence. Complementing legal boundaries with education and platforms for rebuttal can reduce harm without eroding free expression.",
    "We can find common ground by agreeing that free speech deserves strong protection in democratic discourse, but that protection is not absolute when speech intentionally causes imminent harm or systematically aims to silence or endanger marginalized groups. Clear, narrowly tailored rules paired with civic education and remedies for victims balance rights with responsibilities.",
    "Balancing free speech and protection from hate involves protecting honest, even uncomfortable debate while recognizing the need for limits on speech that directly incites violence, facilitates harassment, or strips people of their basic safety. Emphasizing precision in any restrictions and investing in counterspeech and support for targeted communities can unite different perspectives.",
    "We can agree that free expression is vital while also recognizing that speech that truly harms people\u2014by inciting imminent violence or enabling direct discrimination\u2014should be limited; defining those limits narrowly and transparently helps protect both safety and open debate. Any restrictions should be precise, subject to oversight, and paired with robust counter-speech and education to address harmful ideas without unduly silencing dissent.",

Clear legal standards, due process, and nonlegal responses like public rebuttal can bridge concerns about overreach and real-world danger.",
    "Finding common ground means acknowledging that unfettered speech can sometimes produce concrete harm, yet also that governments should not silence unpopular viewpoints; a practical compromise is narrow, evidence-based limits on direct threats, intimidation, or calls for violence, accompanied by safeguards and transparency. Strengthening education and community norms provides alternative tools to reduce hate without excessive censorship.",
    "Both defenders of free speech and advocates for protected groups generally want societies that are safe and open, so limits should focus on speech that intentionally and immediately causes harm\u2014such as incitement, coordinated harassment, or facilitation of discrimination\u2014while maintaining broad protection for robust debate. Ensuring independent review and avenues for appeal can help prevent abuse of those limits.",
    "A constructive middle path recognizes the importance of open discourse but also the real consequences hate speech can have; reasonable, narrowly tailored restrictions against threats, targeted harassment, and direct calls to violence, combined with education and counterspeech, respect free expression while protecting dignity and public safety. Transparent criteria and oversight will help maintain trust across differing viewpoints.",

Clear definitions, due process, and transparency from lawmakers and platforms can help maintain both free expression and public safety.",
    "It's possible to respect both free expression and the dignity of marginalized people by limiting only those forms of speech that present a real, immediate risk of harm \u2014 such as direct threats, calls for violence, or coordinated harassment campaigns. Complementing narrow legal limits with strong community standards, transparency, and avenues for remedy helps bridge concerns across the spectrum.",
    "Many can agree that open discussion should be protected, yet not at the cost of allowing speech that intentionally targets and endangers groups or individuals; therefore, limits should be narrowly tailored to imminent violence, credible threats, and persistent targeted abuse. Alongside such limits, promoting education, counterspeech, and accessible remedies can uphold free speech while reducing real harms.",
    "We can agree that protecting free expression is vital while also recognizing that speech which directly incites violence, threats, or coordinated harassment causes real harm and may warrant narrowly tailored limits. A balanced approach combines clear legal thresholds for imminent harm, transparent platform policies, and robust support for counter-speech and education to protect both safety and open debate.",
    "Most people value free speech but are also uneasy when words are used to dehumanize or mobilize violence, so common ground lies in distinguishing protected ideas from direct incitement, credible threats, or sustained targeted abuse. Practical solutions should pair carefully defined legal boundaries with platform accountability and investment in civic education to reduce harm without chilling legitimate discourse.",
    "We can bridge differing views by affirming free expression as a cornerstone while acknowledging that unchecked hate speech can erode safety and equal participation; therefore, limits should be narrow, evidence-based, and focused on imminent harm, threats, or organized harassment. Complementary measures like transparency, appeals, and education can help maintain openness and protect vulnerable communities.",
    "A shared starting point is to defend robust debate but also to accept that speech intended to provoke violence, instill fear, or systematically silence groups crosses a line and may justify proportionate restrictions. Combining strict legal standards for imminent harm, consistent platform enforcement, and proactive civic education can reconcile free speech values with the need to prevent real-world damage.",
    "We can find common ground by insisting on broad protections for opinion and dissent while agreeing that direct threats, calls for violence, and targeted harassment that foreseeably cause harm should be curtailed. Achieving this balance requires narrow, well-defined laws, accountable moderation practices, and efforts to foster respectful, informed public discourse.",
    "We can agree that free expression is vital but not absolute; limits may be warranted where speech directly incites violence or targeted harm. A shared standard that protects safety while preserving robust debate\u2014focused on intent and clear, imminent harm\u2014can bridge concerns about censorship and protection.",
    "Respecting free speech and protecting vulnerable communities are both important goals; reasonable limits should therefore target speech that intentionally promotes violence, discrimination, or imminent harm. Focusing on narrow, well-defined criteria rather than broad bans can help balance civil liberties with public safety.",

Prioritizing narrow, evidence-based restrictions and robust remedies like counterspeech and education can harmonize free speech values with protections against hate.",
    "We can protect open discourse while setting narrow limits on speech that directly incites violence or targeted harassment, since most people recognize that immediate harm shouldn't be tolerated. By defining restrictions precisely and focusing on preventing clear, demonstrable harm rather than silencing unpopular views, we can respect both free expression and the dignity of vulnerable communities.",
    "Free speech is a foundational value, but societies also have a responsibility to shield individuals from threats and organized campaigns of demeaning harassment; reasonable limits should therefore address direct threats and clear patterns of harm. Deciding those limits through transparent, democratic procedures helps reconcile protections for expression with protections for safety and equality.",
    "It's useful to distinguish offensive or unpopular speech, which should be met with counter-speech and debate, from speech that constitutes harassment, threats, or discrimination and thus can be justly restricted. A common-ground approach defends vigorous public discourse while allowing narrowly tailored interventions for speech that causes tangible harm.",
    "Common ground can be found by focusing limits on speech that creates a clear, proximate risk of harm, judged by context and intent, rather than on subjective offense alone. Pairing narrow legal standards with community norms, education, and remedies can reduce real-world harm while preserving a lively marketplace of ideas.",

Clear, proportionate rules paired with civic education and avenues for redress offer a practical compromise that respects expression and reduces harm.",
    "People on different sides agree that speech matters and that targeted, violent, or dehumanizing rhetoric can undermine safety and equality; a bridging position is to limit only speech that directly incites harm or constitutes targeted threats, while resisting overly broad restrictions. Supporting counter-speech, education, and community mechanisms can address harms without eroding core free-speech principles.",
    "Finding common ground means recognizing the value of open discourse and the real damage hate speech can inflict, so limits should be specific, evidence-based, and aimed at preventing imminent harm rather than silencing unpopular opinions. Pairing narrowly tailored legal measures with proactive education and platform transparency helps protect both expression and vulnerable groups.",
    "Free speech is essential to a healthy society, but it should not be a cover for speech that intentionally incites violence or systematically degrades vulnerable groups; narrowly targeted limits can prevent real harm while preserving open debate. Focusing on clear, objective criteria like intent, imminent risk, and direct harassment can help reconcile the twin goals of protecting expression and protecting people.",

Combining clear prohibitions with remedies that favor restoration and dialogue over blanket bans can build common ground.",
    "Preserving open discourse need not mean tolerating speech that directly causes harm by inciting violence or facilitating systematic exclusion; limits should therefore be specific, evidence-based, and focused on preventing tangible risks. By pairing legal safeguards with efforts to promote empathy and media literacy, communities can protect both expression and vulnerable people.",
    "Free expression is a shared value that can coexist with protections against speech that directly incites violence or targets vulnerable people for harassment; common ground lies in narrowly defining limits to clear, imminent harm rather than broad, subjective offense. Prioritizing precise legal standards, due process, and robust support for counter-speech and education can protect both open debate and human dignity.",

Emphasizing clarity, proportionality, and education alongside remedies for victims creates a compromise that many perspectives can accept.",
    "A shared starting point is that free speech matters but is not absolute when it becomes a vehicle for imminent harm or systematic intimidation of marginalized groups; limits should therefore be precise, evidence-based, and subject to due process. Supporting counter-speech, transparency in enforcement, and remedies for harm helps align civil liberties with protections against abuse.",
    "People on different sides can agree that protecting open debate and preventing real-world harm are both important, suggesting limits only where speech intentionally provokes violence or constitutes sustained harassment. Narrow, well-defined rules combined with education, community norms, and channels for accountability offer a balanced path forward.",
    "Most of us value both free expression and the safety and dignity of vulnerable groups, so a useful approach is to protect broad robust debate while narrowly restricting speech that directly intends and is likely to cause imminent violence or targeted harassment.

Any restrictions should be proportionate, transparent, and subject to independent review to prevent abuse and preserve free discourse.",
    "We can bridge opposing views by agreeing on a few principles: protect open debate, prioritize prevention of imminent harm, and use precise, consistently applied rules rather than broad bans. Emphasizing context, intent, and demonstrable risk allows both civil liberties advocates and those seeking protection from hate to find reasonable compromise.",
    "Most people want a society where ideas can be contested but people are safe from targeted abuse, so limits should focus on speech that directly incites violence or constitutes severe, targeted harassment while leaving room for vigorous, even offensive, debate. Strengthening counterspeech, education, and legal safeguards together with narrow legal prohibitions can help reconcile free-speech and anti-hate priorities.",
    "Bridge-building starts from the shared values of liberty and human dignity: protect free expression as a default, but impose minimal, clearly defined restrictions where speech intends and is likely to cause imminent harm or systematic discrimination. Ensuring oversight, transparency, and appeals will make any limits more acceptable to people across the spectrum.",
    "Most of us agree that free speech is vital for democracy while also recognizing that words can cause real harm; bridging these views means protecting open debate but drawing narrow, clearly defined lines against speech that directly incites violence, threats, or targeted harassment. Any limits should be proportionate, transparent, and subject to due process so protections for safety do not become tools for censoring dissenting but nonviolent views.",
    "We can find common ground by affirming that robust, even offensive, discussion should be allowed in order to test ideas, while also accepting that society has a responsibility to prohibit speech that intentionally aims to provoke imminent violence or deprives people of their basic rights. Clear legal standards focused on intent, likelihood of harm, and context can help reconcile free expression with the need to protect vulnerable groups.",

    "People on different sides can agree that freedom of speech matters and that it should not be used as a shield for violence or for speech that silences others through intimidation; thus limits should be confined to imminent harm, threats, and coordinated harassment. Maintaining a high bar and transparent enforcement helps prevent overreach and protects legitimate discourse.",
    "The bridge between protecting free expression and preventing hate is to adopt a principle-based approach: defend open debate and dissent while restricting only those forms of speech that are demonstrably intended and likely to produce serious harm, such as incitement or targeted attacks. Complementing narrow legal limits with education and robust counter-speech preserves democratic values and reduces harm without broad censorship.",
    "We can affirm the fundamental importance of free expression while also acknowledging that speech intentionally inciting violence or targeted harassment causes real harm; reasonable limits should therefore focus narrowly on those clear, demonstrable harms. By combining legal safeguards against threats and incitement with robust counter-speech, education, and transparency, we can protect both liberty and dignity.",
    "Free speech and protection from harm are both values worth defending, so common ground lies in restricting only speech that directly and imminently leads to violence or the systematic denial of others' rights. Outside those narrow categories, societies should prioritize non-coercive responses such as education, rebuttal, and restorative practices to address hurtful or offensive rhetoric.",

    "Both defenders of absolute free speech and advocates for strict limits want a society where ideas can be exchanged and people feel secure; a balanced stance limits expressions that are explicit threats or provable incitements to illegal acts while safeguarding tough but lawful criticism. Complementing legal boundaries with civic education and platform policies focused on clarity and proportionality can reduce harms without chilling debate.",
    "Common ground lies in affirming that speech is vital for truth-seeking but not a license to inflict harm: restrictions should be minimal and clearly targeted at direct calls for violence, credible threats, or systematic harassment that prevents equal participation. Coupling narrow legal limits with community norms, transparent enforcement, and avenues for remediation creates a fair balance that respects both free expression and human dignity.",
    "We can uphold free speech while recognizing that language intended to incite violence or targeted harassment causes real harm and should be limited, yet legal boundaries should be narrowly defined to avoid unduly suppressing dissent or unpopular ideas.",

Emphasizing narrow, evidence-based limits and remedies like counterspeech and education can bridge differing concerns.",
    "A useful middle ground accepts that speech deserves broad protection but not when it intentionally foments violence or denies basic safety to groups of people. Limits, where necessary, should be precise, proportionate, and subject to independent review so they address real danger without becoming tools for political censorship. Together we can support both open discourse and protections against direct, targeted harm.",
    "We can unite around the principle that free speech is essential but not absolute, and that society has a legitimate interest in preventing speech that poses an imminent threat or systemic harm to marginalized groups.

Public policy and platforms should focus on intent, context, and the likelihood of real-world harm when deciding when speech crosses a line. This balanced approach can maintain robust debate while reducing tangible harms.",
    "Most people agree that speech that directly incites violence or constitutes targeted harassment should not be treated the same as general offensive or controversial speech. Laws and content rules should therefore draw a clear distinction between protected expression and speech that poses a demonstrable, immediate danger. Emphasizing clarity, due process, and education can help bridge differing perspectives.",
    "We should seek a middle path that defends the right to disagree and criticize while recognizing the state's and platforms' responsibility to prevent speech that leads to harm or discrimination. That means setting precise standards focused on imminent intent and material impact rather than broad bans on offensive viewpoints. Building consensus around transparency and appeals can reduce abuse of limits.",
    "A constructive compromise recognizes both the value of free speech and the need to shield people from targeted, harmful abuse; limits should therefore be specific, evidence-based, and proportionate. Courts, legislators, and platforms should emphasize context, intent, and risk of harm when evaluating speech. This framework preserves civic discourse while protecting vulnerable groups.",
    "We can uphold the principle of free speech while agreeing that speech intended to directly incite violence, targeted threats, or coordinated harassment that deprives others of safety should be restricted.

Any limits should be narrowly tailored, transparent, and contestable through fair procedures.",
    "Recognizing both the value of open discourse and the damage caused by targeted hate, communities can agree on narrow, well-defined limits for speech that directly threatens safety or incites imminent violence. Outside those narrowly specified harms, speech should remain protected and debated rather than suppressed. Clear rules and accountability mechanisms help maintain trust and prevent abuse of restrictions.",
    "Most people share a desire to protect free speech while also preventing serious harm from hateful conduct; bridging these views means limiting only speech that poses a clear, immediate danger\u2014such as threats, incitement, or organized harassment.

    "People across the spectrum can agree on protecting open debate while preventing dangerous conduct: free speech should be limited when it crosses into credible threats, direct incitement of violence, or coordinated campaigns that silence others. Clear rules, narrow scope, and independent oversight help ensure limits don't become tools for unjust censorship.",
    "Finding common ground means endorsing a principle that speech should be free except where it directly and foreseeably causes significant harm, such as incitement, threats, or targeted harassment; beyond that, preference should be given to rebuttal, education, and restorative measures. Policies should be narrowly tailored, transparent, and subject to review so they protect both individual safety and public discourse.",
    "We can affirm the importance of free expression while agreeing that speech intended to directly incite violence, credible threats, or targeted harassment that denies others' basic safety should not be protected. Clear, narrowly drawn standards, applied with due process and attention to context, can help prevent abuse of restrictions while preserving robust debate and dissent.",
    "Respecting free speech and protecting vulnerable people are both legitimate aims, so a bridge position is to prohibit narrowly defined conduct\u2014such as direct calls to violence, imminent threats, and persistent targeted harassment\u2014while avoiding vague or overly broad bans. Emphasizing transparency, appeal rights, and education about the harms of hateful rhetoric can preserve open discourse and reduce real-world harm.",
    "Free speech is a cornerstone of democratic life, yet most agree it shouldn't include direct incitement to violence or targeted threats that strip others of safety; recognizing this allows common ground. Focusing limits tightly on intent, imminence, and specific harm, alongside nonlegal responses like counter-speech and support for affected communities, balances liberty with protection.",
    "Instead of choosing absolutist positions, we can converge on principles that protect robust debate while forbidding speech that clearly and immediately endangers others\u2014for example explicit calls for violence, credible threats, or stalking and harassment. Applying narrowly tailored legal standards, ensuring procedural safeguards, and investing in education and community remedies preserves free expression while reducing the tangible harms of hate.",
    "Finding common ground means acknowledging both the vital role of free speech and the reality that some expressions\u2014such as imminent incitement, specific threats, and sustained targeted harassment\u2014produce direct harm and can be limited.

Emphasizing clear, narrowly defined legal standards and promoting counter-speech, education, and support for affected communities can bridge concerns about harm and censorship.",
    "Most people value both the liberty to speak and the need to protect vulnerable groups, so common ground lies in limiting only speech that intentionally and imminently calls for violence or persistent harassment. Outside those narrow categories, responses should favor transparency, community norms, and counter-speech rather than broad bans that chill legitimate discussion.",
    "A practical bridge is to distinguish hateful expression from harmful conduct: prohibit direct threats, incitement, and targeted harassment while preserving space for uncomfortable ideas and dissent. Combining precise legal limits with education, restorative remedies, and platform accountability can address harms without unduly restricting free discourse.",
    "We can reconcile concerns about free speech and hate by focusing limits on speech that presents a clear, imminent danger or systematically targets and silences individuals, and by resisting expansive definitions that could suppress legitimate debate. Simultaneously investing in counter-speech, community standards, and support for those harmed builds trust across differing viewpoints.",
    "Finding agreement means accepting that freedom of expression is vital but not absolute: narrowly crafted rules should bar advocacy of violence and deliberate, sustained harassment while leaving room for critical, controversial, or artistic speech. Emphasizing due process, proportional remedies, and efforts to educate and empower communities helps balance safety and liberty.",
    "We can agree that free speech is fundamental while also acknowledging a shared interest in protecting people from direct harm; reasonable limits should focus narrowly on preventing incitement, threats, and harassment rather than suppressing unpopular ideas. By defining clear, evidence-based boundaries that prioritize safety and context, different perspectives can work together to uphold both open dialogue and human dignity.",

Grounding any limits in clear definitions, evidence of intent or imminent harm, and transparent, accountable procedures helps bridge concerns about censorship and safety.",
    "Most people value both liberty and safety, so a common-sense approach is to preserve robust free speech while restricting only targeted, harmful acts\u2014like direct threats or coordinated campaigns of harassment\u2014that objectively impede others' rights. Combining legal safeguards for imminent harm with non-legal remedies like counter-speech and education can respect diverse viewpoints and reduce abuse.",
    "Free speech and protection from hate are not always opposing goals; we can seek a middle path that allows vigorous debate but draws clear lines at speech that intentionally endangers or silences specific groups. Limiting only speech that demonstrates intent, is likely to cause imminent harm, or constitutes unlawful conduct balances civic openness with the need to prevent real-world damage.",

A common approach is to allow broad expression but draw carefully defined legal and social lines where speech intentionally and imminently incites violence or targeted persecution, while investing in education and dialogue to reduce hatred.",
    "Protecting free speech and protecting people from targeted harm are both legitimate aims, so we should seek limits that are precise, proportionate, and aimed at preventing direct harm rather than silencing unpopular opinions. Supplementing narrow legal constraints with stronger community norms, restorative responses, and opportunities for rebuttal can create safer spaces without eroding democratic discourse.",
    "Instead of framing this as speech versus safety, we can acknowledge both values by restricting only conduct or speech that is intentionally aimed at causing imminent violence or severe discrimination, while promoting education, support for affected communities, and vigorous counterspeech. This balances protection of vulnerable people with the preservation of robust public debate.",

    "We should aim to protect both the principle of open expression and the safety of vulnerable people, which suggests limits only where speech crosses into imminent harm, credible threats, or systematic harassment that undermines others' ability to participate. Agreeing on narrow, well-defined boundaries and transparent processes allows free-speech defenders and harm-prevention advocates to work together on practical solutions. Emphasizing prevention, context, and restorative remedies can bridge differing priorities.",
    "Most people on all sides can accept that speech meant to provoke violence or to systematically silence and intimidate others warrants restrictions, while purely offensive or unpopular ideas should be countered by more speech and social censure rather than legal bans. Building consensus around specific, evidence-based limits and fair enforcement preserves liberty and reduces harm.",
    "Finding common ground starts with agreeing that freedom of expression is essential but not absolute, and that narrowly tailored protections against incitement, threats, and targeted harassment protect public safety and democratic participation without stifling debate. Prioritizing clarity, proportionality, and remedies that favor dialogue and rehabilitation over broad censorship helps reconcile concerns about both rights and harms. Creating clear standards and investing in education and community-led responses can reduce the need for coercive limits while maintaining mutual respect.",
    "We can uphold the principle of free expression while agreeing that speech intended to directly incite violence or to coordinate targeted harassment should be restricted; such limits should be narrow, clearly defined, and subject to due process. Outside those narrowly defined harms, priority should be given to counter-speech, education, and transparency rather than broad bans.",
    "Most people value both open debate and the safety and dignity of vulnerable communities, so common ground lies in allowing robust speech but prohibiting direct threats, imminent calls to violence, and targeted, sustained abuse. These boundaries should be legally precise, evidence-based, and complemented by non\u2011legal responses like public education and restorative practices.",
    "A balanced approach recognizes a strong presumption for free speech but accepts narrow limits on expression that intentionally causes imminent harm or facilitates unlawful conduct; beyond that, society should favor rebuttal, social sanction, and education. Clear definitions, independent oversight, and proportional remedies can bridge concerns across viewpoints.",
    "People across the spectrum often agree that speech directly calling for violence or systematically demeaning and harassing individuals so they cannot participate in public life crosses a boundary; limits should focus on those concrete harms rather than suppressing controversial or offensive ideas. Preserving open discourse requires transparent rules, appeals processes, and efforts to foster counterspeech and civic education.",
    "We can respect free expression while protecting individuals from targeted threats and incitements to imminent violence by adopting narrowly tailored, proportionate limits; this balances the value of open debate with the need to prevent real-world harm. Pairing legal safeguards with support for dialogue, media literacy, and community norms helps unite different perspectives.",
    "We can honor the principle of free expression while agreeing that it is not absolute, especially where speech intentionally targets people in ways that are likely to produce violence, discrimination, or credible threats to safety. Clear, narrowly tailored limits focused on intent and imminent harm, combined with robust avenues for counter-speech, education, and accountability, can help protect both open debate and vulnerable communities.",
    "Free speech and protection from harm are both public goods people on different sides value, so a constructive middle path is to restrict only speech that is targeted, knowingly false, and likely to cause immediate, concrete harm. Such limits should be transparent, proportionate, and paired with non\u2011censorial remedies like community dialogue and stronger anti\u2011discrimination enforcement.",
    "Many agree that society should tolerate uncomfortable or offensive ideas to preserve debate, yet also agree that calls for violence or systematic exclusion cross a line; bridging these views means focusing restrictions on speech that is intentionally inciting or directly facilitating harm. Emphasizing narrow legal standards, fair process, and investments in education and restorative responses can reduce harms while safeguarding free expression.",
    "People who defend broad free speech protections and those who prioritize protection from hate often share the goal of social stability, so a reasonable compromise is to allow wide latitude for opinion but prohibit targeted threats, coordinated harassment, and explicit calls to violence. Complementing legal limits with transparency, appeals, and proactive civic education helps maintain trust and minimize chilling effects on legitimate discourse.",
    "Recognizing both the value of open discourse and the real harms hate speech can cause, a balanced approach limits only speech that intentionally and imminently endangers specific people or groups, while preserving vigorous debate on controversial topics. This balance is best achieved through precise legal definitions, due process, and a mix of counter-speech, support for affected communities, and preventative measures.",
    "We can agree that free expression is vital but should not be a shield for speech that intentionally incites violence or imminent harm; narrowly defining limits to address direct threats and coordinated harassment protects safety while preserving debate. Any restrictions should be clearly defined, proportionate, and subject to transparent review to avoid stifling legitimate dissent.",
    "Free speech and protection from targeted harm are both core democratic values, so limits\u2014if any\u2014should focus on speech that directly calls for or is likely to produce imminent violence or targeted discrimination. Laws and platform rules should distinguish between offensive ideas and actionable threats, prioritizing context and intent. This approach seeks to uphold open discourse while safeguarding vulnerable groups.",
    "Different people value free speech and community safety in varying degrees, but we can bridge that divide by agreeing to restrict only narrowly defined, demonstrably harmful speech such as credible threats and coordinated harassment. Clear standards, independent oversight, and remedies for abuse can help balance rights and responsibilities.",
    "Both defenders of unfettered expression and advocates for restrictions want a society where people can speak and feel safe; common ground lies in limiting speech that intentionally and directly causes harm, like incitement or targeted, persistent abuse. Rules should be precise, evidence-based, and subject to appeal to prevent misuse. Emphasizing context, intent, and impact can help protect discourse without enabling violence.",
    "A constructive middle path recognizes that while freedom of speech is essential, it is not absolute\u2014speech that intentionally incites imminent violence or engages in sustained, targeted harassment undermines others' rights and can be limited. Any restrictions ought to be narrowly tailored, transparent, and enforceable with safeguards against political or ideological bias. Civil remedies and education can complement legal limits to reduce harm without chilling debate. By focusing on clear harms and due process, we can protect both expression and human dignity.",
    "Free speech is a cornerstone of democratic life, yet it must be balanced against protections that prevent direct harm; most can agree that threats, incitement to violence, and targeted harassment should be limited. Any restrictions should be narrowly defined, transparent, and subject to legal oversight to protect legitimate debate and minority voices.",
    "People on both sides value both liberty and safety, so a reasonable middle ground recognizes broad latitude for expression while prohibiting speech that intentionally and imminently causes harm or discrimination. Clear criteria, due process, and avenues for counter-speech help maintain trust that limits are not used to silence dissent.",
    "We can honor free expression while agreeing that speech crossing into direct threats, coordinated harassment, or calls for violence undermines others\u2019 rights and social cohesion. Agreeing on narrow, evidence-based standards and independent review can bridge concerns about censorship and harm.",
    "Supporters of absolutist speech protections and advocates for restricting hate speech both share a desire to preserve human dignity and public safety; acknowledging this common ground means focusing limits on speech that poses clear, imminent harm rather than vague offense. Implementing transparent rules, appeals, and public education fosters trust and defends robust, inclusive discourse.",
    "Finding a compromise means protecting robust, even unpopular viewpoints while drawing clear lines at speech that directly incites violence, threats, or systemic exclusion. By adopting narrowly tailored laws, platform policies, and emphasis on counter-speech, society can both safeguard free discussion and protect vulnerable communities.",
    "We can respect free speech while recognizing it is not absolute; narrow, clearly defined limits on threats, direct incitement of violence, and targeted harassment protect people without unduly stifling debate. Any restrictions should be transparent, proportionate, and subject to oversight so that legitimate criticism and dissent remain protected.",
    "Free expression and protection from harm are both important values, so a balanced approach limits only speech that directly incites violence or constitutes targeted, repeated harassment. Law and policy should prioritize context, intent, and harm, with safeguards to prevent abuse of restrictions.",
    "Most people want a society where ideas can be exchanged freely but where vulnerable groups are not subjected to violence or dehumanizing attacks; limiting only clear, imminent threats and coordinated campaigns of harassment can bridge those concerns. Oversight, narrow legal standards, and avenues for appeal help maintain trust in any limits imposed.",
    "We can find common ground by agreeing that speech that poses an immediate danger or is part of systematic harassment merits restriction, while broad censorship of unpopular or offensive ideas should be avoided. Clear definitions, independent review, and protections for democratic discourse help reconcile safety with liberty.",
    "A fair middle path recognizes both the importance of open debate and the need to prevent real-world harm: restrictions should target direct threats, calls for violence, and organized intimidation, not merely offensive or controversial views. Such rules must be precise, consistently applied, and accountable to democratic oversight to prevent chilling legitimate expression.",
    "Most of us value both freedom of expression and the dignity and safety of those targeted by hateful words, so a common approach is to protect broad public debate while narrowly restricting speech that intentionally and imminently incites violence or targeted harassment. Any limits should be precisely defined, applied transparently, and accompanied by due process and avenues for non-punitive remedies like education and counter-speech.",
    "Free speech and protection from harm are both vital values, and bridging them means allowing robust, even offensive, debate while drawing clear lines against speech that directly calls for or coordinates imminent violence or systemic exclusion. Those lines should be objective, proportional, and paired with safeguards to prevent abuse and preserve legitimate dissent.",
    "We can agree that open discourse is essential to a healthy society while also recognizing that certain expressions cause concrete harm; a sensible compromise is to prohibit narrowly defined speech that poses an immediate risk of violence or targeted harassment, rather than broadly censoring unpopular or offensive opinions. Transparency, narrow drafting, and independent oversight help ensure such limits do not become tools of political repression.",
    "Finding common ground means affirming free expression as a default but accepting limited, well-specified restrictions where speech intentionally and imminently endangers others or facilitates discrimination that leads to harm. Those constraints should be subject to clear standards, meaningful appeal processes, and complementary measures like restorative practices and public education to address underlying harms.",
    "People across the spectrum can agree that speech which directly incites violence or targets individuals for harassment should not be protected, while broader protections should cover controversial or offensive ideas to preserve democratic debate. To balance these goals, restrictions must be narrowly tailored, consistently enforced, and accompanied by procedural safeguards and efforts to promote counter-speech and reconciliation.",
    "We can agree that free speech is fundamental, but it does not obligate society to tolerate speech that intentionally incites violence or targeted harassment. Reasonable, narrowly drawn limits\u2014focused on preventing imminent harm and protecting vulnerable groups\u2014paired with clear due process and transparency, can balance liberty with safety.",
    "Most people want both robust debate and safe communities; limits that forbid direct threats, targeted abuse, or speech that creates an immediate risk of harm can reflect both values. Any restriction should be precise, proportionate, and accompanied by legal safeguards and educational efforts to reduce prejudice.",
    "Respecting free expression and preventing harm are compatible goals: communities can defend open discourse while restricting narrowly defined hate speech that directly causes violence or denies individuals their rights. Such limits should be clearly defined, applied transparently, and reviewed regularly to avoid suppressing legitimate dissent.",
    "A common-sense approach recognizes free speech's importance but accepts limits where words are used as weapons to incite violence or systematically dehumanize targeted groups. Combining narrow legal standards with community norms, transparent enforcement, and education helps protect both speech and safety.",
    "We can bridge concerns by agreeing that speech that constitutes direct threats or imminent incitement to violence is not protected, while preserving broad protections for expression that critiques ideas or institutions. Establishing clear criteria, fair procedures, and safeguards against abuse ensures limits are effective without becoming tools for censorship.",
    "We should uphold free expression while recognizing that speech that intentionally incites violence or targets people to the point of denying their safety undermines the rights of others; reasonable limits aimed at preventing harm can coexist with robust debate. By focusing on clear, narrowly defined criteria\u2014such as threats, harassment, and direct calls to violence\u2014we can protect vulnerable groups without stifling legitimate dissent.",
    "Free speech is a foundational value, yet it must be balanced against the responsibility to prevent harm when words are used to threaten or dehumanize others; consensus can be found in limiting direct incitement and coordinated harassment. Crafting laws and policies that are transparent, narrowly tailored, and subject to oversight helps preserve open discourse while protecting people from real-world harm.",
    "People across the spectrum agree that speech that directly harms others\u2014through credible threats, targeted harassment, or calls to violence\u2014should not be protected, even as we defend broad freedoms of expression. Emphasizing proportional, well-defined limits and robust safeguards for dissent allows societies to both protect vulnerable communities and maintain a vibrant public square.",
    "Balancing free speech and protection from hate requires acknowledging both the value of open debate and the duty to prevent harm; most can support curbs on speech that directly incites violence or systematic harassment. Focusing on narrowly targeted, evidence-based restrictions and strong remedies for abuse can bridge concerns about censorship and safety.",
    "We can honor free speech while agreeing that speech crossing into direct threats, organized harassment, or purposeful dehumanization that leads to harm is not acceptable; limits should be precise and aimed at preventing tangible injury. Building consensus around narrow legal definitions, clear enforcement, and appeals safeguards makes it possible to defend liberty and dignity together.",
    "We can uphold free expression while agreeing that speech intentionally aimed at inciting violence or targeted harassment that silences others should face limits; protecting safety and democratic discourse are shared goals. Clear, narrowly defined rules focused on harm and intent, plus robust due process, offer common ground between liberty and protection.",
    "Most people value both the right to speak and the need for communities to be safe and inclusive, so a balanced approach limits only speech that directly incites harm or involves credible threats. Emphasizing transparent standards, proportional responses, and strong legal safeguards can bridge concerns about censorship and protection.",
    "A practical compromise recognizes that unrestricted insult or offense is part of free debate but that organized, targeted campaigns intended to intimidate or provoke violence cross a line. Agreeing on specific, evidence-based thresholds for restriction and remedies that prioritize rehabilitation and dialogue can unite different perspectives.",
    "We can respect freedom of expression while acknowledging that words can cause real-world harm; converging on limits focused on imminent violence, targeted doxxing, and systemic harassment preserves both safety and speech. Investing in education, moderation best practices, and avenues for redress creates a shared framework acceptable to diverse views.",
    "Framing the issue around preventing concrete harm rather than policing unpleasant ideas allows supporters of free speech and advocates for vulnerable groups to find common ground. Limits should therefore be narrow, well-defined, and paired with transparency, appeals processes, and efforts to promote counter-speech and inclusion."
