    "763": "Free speech is essential for democracy and airing grievances, yet speech that intentionally incites violence, organizes targeted harassment, or systematically excludes groups corrodes public health and equal access to services. Limits should therefore be narrowly defined to prevent direct harm while preserving vigorous debate, with emphasis on accountability, restorative measures, and education to build mutual understanding.",
    "783": "Free expression is vital to a healthy democracy, yet speech that directly incites violence or systematically dehumanizes and threatens the safety of vulnerable communities undermines that democratic fabric. Reasonable, narrowly tailored limits\u2014focused on true threats, targeted harassment, and deliberate incitement\u2014paired with due process, community-led restorative approaches, and robust civic education can protect both liberty and dignity.",
    "753": "Free expression is vital to democratic life, but speech that directly incites violence, issues credible threats, or engages in sustained targeted harassment that silences vulnerable people should be limited. Beyond narrow legal restrictions, communities and institutions should prioritize counterspeech, education, restorative practices, and clear policies in shared spaces so debate remains robust while protecting dignity and safety. This middle path honors both the need for open debate and the obligation to shield neighbors from dehumanizing rhetoric.",
    "742": "Free speech is essential to democratic life, but hateful expression that escalates into direct threats, incitement to violence, or sustained harassment should not be protected because it undermines others\u2019 ability to participate in public life. Any limits must be narrowly tailored, transparently defined, and enforced with clear standards and independent oversight so safety is balanced with robust democratic debate.",
    "771": "Free speech should remain robust because open debate is essential to a free society, but narrowly tailored limits are justified to prevent direct threats, incitement to violence, and targeted harassment that endanger others. Like careful measurements in a workshop, such restrictions should be precise and focus on actions that cause real harm rather than broad categories of offensive ideas, while encouraging counterspeech, education, and community norms to address hateful sentiments. This balances respect for liberty with protection of public safety and human dignity, offering common ground between concerns for free expression and social cohesion.",
    "774": "Common ground exists in valuing both free expression and the protection of human dignity and safety. Limits should be narrow and clearly defined\u2014focusing on direct incitement to violence, true threats, and targeted harassment\u2014while preserving space for robust, even uncomfortable, debate and relying on education, counterspeech, and restorative remedies to reduce harm. Such an approach balances civil liberties with community well-being and offers practical, evidence-based tools to protect vulnerable people without needlessly chilling legitimate discourse.",
    "779": "Free expression should be broad, but narrow, clearly defined limits are justified where speech directly incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or intentionally targets vulnerable people in ways that undermine safety and participation in community life. Striking a balance means focusing on concrete harms and using clear legal standards and due process to avoid vague bans that chill artistic expression, political dissent, or honest disagreement.",
    "734": "Freedom of speech should be strongly protected, with narrowly tailored limits only for speech that intentionally incites imminent violence, constitutes a credible threat, or is targeted harassment that undermines public safety. Like tending a field, interventions should be careful and precise\u2014removing poisonous weeds to protect the crop\u2014while offensive or unpopular views are best countered with robust debate, community norms, and non\u2011coercive measures rather than broad censorship.",
    "791": "Free speech is essential to a healthy democracy, but speech that deliberately dehumanizes or incites violence against people should be limited by narrowly defined laws that target intent and imminent harm rather than broad censorship. Alongside legal safeguards, communities should invest in education, restorative responses, and robust counter-speech to protect dignity and safety while preserving open dialogue.",
    "762": "Free speech is essential to a free society and the open exchange of ideas should be protected, but it must be balanced with the need to keep communities safe and respectful. Legal limits ought to be narrowly tailored to prohibit direct incitement to violence, true threats, and coordinated harassment while preserving space for robust, even uncomfortable, debate. Private platforms, businesses, and local communities should be empowered to set conduct standards and invest in education and dialogue as longer-term tools to reduce hate.",
    "792": "Free speech deserves strong protection, yet narrow limits are justified when words directly threaten, harass, or incite violence against vulnerable people, undermining safety in homes, care settings, and communities. Laws and community norms should target clear harms while preserving privacy, open debate, and the ability for families and caregivers to create environments where differences are addressed respectfully.",
    "773": "Free speech should be broadly protected to encourage exploration, debate, and the exchange of ideas, but narrow limits on hate speech are justified when it directly incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or amounts to targeted, sustained harassment that silences others. Such limits should be precisely defined, evidence-based, and applied with due process to protect both democratic discourse and the dignity and safety of vulnerable communities.",
    "795": "Free speech is essential for progress, yet boundaries should exist where speech intentionally incites violence or systematically degrades and excludes people, undermining equal participation. Clear, narrow legal standards combined with independent oversight and transparent, evidence-based moderation tools can limit harm while preserving robust public debate.",
    "786": "Free expression should remain robust in a liberal democracy, but it is reasonable to limit speech that is narrowly defined as direct incitement to imminent lawless action, true threats, or persistent targeted harassment that effectively silences others. Simultaneously, protections for academic freedom and open debate should be preserved, with remedies prioritizing counterspeech, education, and restorative processes over broad criminalization. Policies must be empirically informed, narrowly tailored, and accompanied by clear procedural safeguards to prevent chilling legitimate dissent while addressing tangible harms.",
    "785": "Free speech is essential for honest, productive conversation, but speech that intentionally incites violence, makes credible threats, or targets individuals for sustained harassment that causes real harm should be restricted. Narrow, well-defined limits based on intent and likely harm\u2014rather than viewpoint\u2014help protect vulnerable people while preserving open debate and encouraging respectful, constructive dialogue.",
    "778": "Free speech and the written word are vital to cultural life and open inquiry, but they should not be a shield for targeted threats, harassment, or direct incitement to violence that undermine people's safety and dignity. Reasonable legal limits on true threats and incitement, paired with education, restorative practices, and vigorous counterspeech, can protect vulnerable communities while preserving robust debate. Grounding policy in empathy and evidence offers a practical middle path that upholds expression without enabling harm.",
    "802": "Free speech is essential for democratic debate, but it should not shield speech that deliberately incites violence, makes credible threats, or constitutes targeted harassment that undermines community safety. Limits ought to be narrowly tailored, clearly defined, and enforced transparently to protect vulnerable people while preserving robust exchange and encouraging accountability and dialogue.",
    "797": "Free speech is vital to a healthy democracy and to honest discussion, yet respect for family, community, and public safety means speech that directly incites violence, constitutes credible threats, or targets individuals with persistent harassment should not be protected. Limits should be narrowly tailored, clearly defined, and enforced consistently so that robust debate can continue while preventing real harm to vulnerable people.",
    "775": "Free expression is essential to a democratic society, but it must be balanced against protections for people targeted by threats, organized incitement, and sustained harassment that undermines their ability to participate. Experience with complex systems suggests narrowly tailored, well-defined limits\u2014focused on direct violence, credible threats, and coordinated harassment\u2014paired with transparent procedures and appeals will protect safety without needlessly silencing difficult or unpopular ideas.",
    "806": "Free speech is essential to a functioning society, but it must be balanced with protecting human dignity and preventing clear, imminent harm. Limits should be narrow and focused\u2014prohibiting direct threats, incitement of violence, and targeted harassment\u2014while avoiding broad, vague bans that stifle honest debate. Community-based responses, restorative practices, and personal accountability should be favored over heavy-handed government suppression to preserve both safety and robust public discourse.",
    "777": "Free expression is vital to democratic life and healthy debate, yet it cannot be an unbounded license to brandish threats, coordinate targeted harassment, or deliberately incite imminent violence. Narrow, clearly defined limits\u2014backed by due process and aimed at preventing real harm to vulnerable people and children\u2014should be paired with robust protections for political and artistic speech and investments in education and counter-speech to build shared understanding rather than blanket censorship.",
    "787": "Free speech is essential to a healthy democracy, but responsibility and respect require that direct threats, credible calls to violence, and targeted harassment that endangers people not be protected. Narrow, clearly defined limits aimed at preventing imminent harm\u2014while preserving robust debate and dissent\u2014offer a practical middle ground that respects both liberty and safety.",
    "796": "Free speech should be robust enough to allow honest debate and artistic expression, but common-sense limits are needed to bar direct threats, incitement to violence, and sustained targeted harassment that puts people\u2014especially children and families\u2014at risk. Legal restrictions should be narrowly tailored to prevent real harm without chilling legitimate criticism, while communities reinforce standards of respect through education and social norms.",
    "784": "Free expression should be protected broadly to preserve democratic debate, yet history makes plain that speech that intentionally incites violence, organizes targeted harassment, or constitutes true threats can destroy communities and warrants narrow, well-defined legal limits. Promoting counter-speech, education, and restorative measures offers common ground for protecting both safety and robust discourse without broadly criminalizing unpopular opinions.",
    "803": "Speech that directly incites violence, organizes targeted harassment, or intentionally dehumanizes protected groups should be restricted, while preserving robust, even uncomfortable debate on matters of public concern. A pragmatic, systems-oriented approach with clear, narrow definitions, transparent enforcement, and accessible redress can protect vulnerable communities without unduly chilling legitimate expression and help build trust across differing viewpoints.",
    "794": "Free speech is essential for democratic debate and problem-solving, yet it should not protect language that deliberately incites violence, makes credible threats, or engages in sustained, targeted harassment that endangers people's safety and dignity. Narrow, clearly defined limits on incitement and direct threats, paired with transparent enforcement, due process, education, and restorative community responses, offer a balanced way to uphold open discourse while protecting vulnerable individuals and families.",
    "804": "Free speech is essential to open inquiry and democratic life, but speech that intentionally dehumanizes, threatens, or incites violence erodes public safety and civic participation. Clear, narrowly tailored limits on direct threats and incitement\u2014paired with strong protections for robust debate\u2014best balance protecting vulnerable people and preserving a marketplace of ideas.",
    "789": "Free speech is essential to a free society, yet it must yield to clear limits when speech becomes direct threats, incitement to imminent violence, or persistent targeted harassment that endangers others. Any restrictions should be narrowly tailored, enforceable under the rule of law with due process, and paired with education, community standards, and restorative responses that preserve robust debate while protecting vulnerable people.",
    "800": "Free speech is essential to civic life and robust debate, but it must be balanced against the need to protect public safety and the dignity of targeted individuals. Limited, clearly defined restrictions on direct incitement, threats, and coordinated harassment, combined with strong community standards and education, can uphold open discourse while preventing harm.",
    "799": "Free speech should be broadly protected to preserve open debate, artistic expression, and the airing of unpopular views, yet reasonable limits are appropriate when speech becomes direct threats, incitement to violence, or targeted harassment that puts others at risk. Clear, narrowly tailored laws aimed at preventing real harm\u2014rather than silencing disagreement\u2014can help bridge the concerns of those who prioritize individual liberty and those who seek safety and dignity for vulnerable people.",
    "801": "Free expression is vital to a healthy democracy, yet narrow limits are appropriate where speech intentionally incites violence, credible threats, or persistent dehumanization that undermines a person's safety and equal participation. Clear legal standards, school policies, and restorative educational responses can protect vulnerable members while preserving open debate by distinguishing harmful conduct from unpopular but legitimate viewpoints.",
    "805": "Free speech should be broadly protected to preserve open debate and individual liberty, while clearly prohibiting hate speech that directly incites violence, coordinated harassment, or credible threats against people. Reasonable, narrowly tailored limits focused on preventing harm\u2014rather than censoring unpopular or offensive ideas\u2014can balance safety for families and communities with the need for robust, honest discussion.",
    "793": "Free speech is a cornerstone of a functioning society and must be protected so that difficult ideas can be aired and debated. Limits ought to be narrowly tailored to prohibit direct incitement, credible threats, and speech intended and likely to produce imminent lawless action, while avoiding vague bans that chill legitimate expression. Like sensible building codes, clear and specific rules protect public safety and dignity, with criminal law addressing real harms and education and community norms countering hateful attitudes.",
    "788": "Experience overseeing a small store and crafting furniture shows that free expression is essential for community life and mutual understanding, but it must not shelter targeted threats, harassment, or deliberate incitement to violence. Narrow, clearly defined legal limits against direct harm, paired with strong community norms that promote civility, can protect vulnerable people while preserving robust debate.",
    "798": "Free expression is essential to an open, inquisitive society, but it should not protect direct incitement to violence, credible threats, or sustained targeted harassment of vulnerable groups. Any limits should be narrowly defined, legally grounded, and paired with transparent platform rules and due process to avoid stifling legitimate debate. Education, community counter-speech, and restorative approaches should be emphasized alongside enforcement to heal harms without unduly curbing free thought.",
    "811": "Long study of human societies shows that speech can both preserve culture and ignite violence, so a balance is needed that protects robust expression while preventing clear, imminent harm. Narrow, clearly defined limits should apply to direct incitement, credible threats, and targeted harassment that foreseeably lead to violence or discrimination. Clear laws, consistent enforcement, and investment in education and counter-speech can protect vulnerable communities without unduly chilling legitimate debate.",
    "810": "Free speech is a cornerstone of a healthy society and should be defended so communities can engage in honest, sometimes uncomfortable debate. At the same time, narrowly tailored limits on speech that deliberately incites violence, targeted harassment, or threatens the safety and dignity of others are appropriate to protect public order, families, and the ability for different viewpoints to coexist.",
    "808": "Free speech should be broadly protected so that unpopular ideas can be aired and tested. Narrow limits are appropriate for direct incitement to violence, credible threats, and sustained targeted harassment that endangers people's safety. Clear legal standards, combined with community and private-sector moderation, can help balance robust debate with protecting dignity and public safety.",
    "812": "Reasonable limits on speech that directly incites violence, credible threats, or coordinated harassment are necessary to protect safety, dignity, and the ability of vulnerable people to participate in public life. Narrow, evidence-based rules that consider intent, likelihood of harm, and context\u2014alongside strong protections for political dissent, art, and scholarly debate\u2014can balance free expression with the need to prevent real-world harm and build common ground.",
    "807": "Free expression is vital to a healthy society, but speech that intentionally incites violence, makes credible threats, or engages in persistent targeted harassment should face clear, narrowly drawn limits to protect public safety and individual dignity. Outside those precise legal boundaries, emphasis should be placed on counterspeech, education, and restorative practices that repair harm without broadly curtailing debate. Employers, institutions, and communities can help by adopting transparent policies and training that balance free expression with respectful, safe environments.",
    "813": "Free speech should be robust and defended as a cornerstone of democracy, but it cannot be a shield for speech that directly causes harm. Like careful woodworking, limits on speech should be precise and measured: clearly prohibiting direct threats, incitement to imminent lawless action, and targeted, persistent harassment that silences others. Combined with education, restorative practices, and community standards, these narrow boundaries protect safety and equal participation while preserving space for honest, even uncomfortable, debate.",
    "790": "Free expression is essential to a free society, but speech that directly incites violence, constitutes true threats, or is targeted, repeated harassment intended to silence people should not be protected. A practical perspective shaped by disciplined service and community work favors narrow legal limits for imminent harm while prioritizing counterspeech, deplatforming, and restorative community measures to address hateful ideas and preserve robust public debate.",
    "809": "Freedom of expression must be preserved, but speech that deliberately incites violence, targets people for dehumanization, or creates a clear, immediate risk of harm should be subject to legal limits. Any restriction should be narrowly defined, legally clear, and paired with community education, restorative practices, and opportunities for constructive dialogue to protect both safety and the open exchange of ideas.",
    "814": "Free speech is essential for a healthy democracy and community dialogue, but hate speech that dehumanizes, threatens, or incites violence undermines public safety and communal well\u2011being and therefore warrants narrow limits, much as fragile habitats require protection from harm. Those limits should be carefully defined to target direct threats, harassment, and calls to violence while preserving robust debate, criticism, and the free exchange of ideas.",
    "182": "Free speech is a cornerstone of a free society and should be vigorously defended, but speech that intentionally incites violence or coordinated harassment against vulnerable people can legitimately be restricted to protect public safety, families, and community harmony. Any limits should be narrowly tailored, transparent, and paired with education and community-based responses so differing viewpoints can be heard while minimizing real harm."
