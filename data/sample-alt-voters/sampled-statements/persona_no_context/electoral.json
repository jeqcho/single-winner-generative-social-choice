    "12": "Any reforms to the Electoral College should preserve the federal balance that gives smaller states a meaningful voice while also addressing concerns about fairness and voter confidence. A practical bridge would be to keep the Electoral College but require states to award electors proportionally or by congressional district, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, and post-election audits. That approach respects tradition and stability while ensuring outcomes more closely reflect the will of voters across every community.",
    "6": "The electoral college should be modernized to better reflect the will of voters while still protecting smaller states and preserving confidence in close elections. Reforms like awarding electors by congressional district or using a proportional split\u2014with clear, uniform nationwide rules for ballot access, recounts, and election security\u2014could balance fairness with stability. This approach respects tradition and federalism while acknowledging that every vote should carry meaningful weight, regardless of where it\u2019s cast.",
    "2": "A healthy democracy should make every vote feel equally meaningful while preserving a system that encourages candidates to listen beyond the biggest media markets. Reforms like the National Popular Vote compact, allocating electors proportionally, or using ranked-choice voting could reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions without dismissing the federal balance many voters value. The best path is a transparent, practical update that strengthens legitimacy, expands participation, and keeps campaigns accountable to both diverse states and diverse communities.",
    "10": "The presidential vote should better reflect the will of the people while still respecting the distinct concerns of smaller states, so reforms like the National Popular Vote compact or proportional allocation of each state\u2019s electoral votes deserve serious, good-faith consideration. Clear, uniform voting standards and automatic audits would strengthen trust, and ranked-choice voting could encourage candidates to reach beyond their base. Any change should be phased in carefully, with broad bipartisan agreement, so families can feel confident that every ballot matters and every community is heard.",
    "22": "A system that makes every vote feel meaningful matters, but so does preserving a stable balance between densely populated cities and smaller communities. Reforms should focus on transparency and trust\u2014uniform voting standards, secure audits, and fair districting\u2014while considering a compromise like allocating electors proportionally by state or adopting the National Popular Vote compact with clear safeguards. The goal should be elections that are easy to understand, hard to game, and accepted as legitimate by people on both sides.",
    "39": "Living with the practical realities of how rules shape outcomes, it makes sense to modernize the Electoral College so every vote carries similar weight while still respecting the role of states. A strong compromise would keep state-based administration but allocate electors proportionally and add a national popular-vote backstop if no candidate reaches a clear majority. That approach preserves stability and regional voice while improving fairness, transparency, and confidence in the result.",
    "18": "Having seen how policy choices land on real people\u2014especially those with limited resources or unstable access to care\u2014any election system should make every vote count clearly and fairly while keeping public trust. A sensible path is to replace the winner-take-all approach with proportional allocation of electors or adopt a national popular vote compact with strong, uniform rules for security and access, so rural and urban communities both feel heard. Reforms should be straightforward, transparent, and focused on protecting equal representation without turning elections into endless recount battles.",
    "49": "Growing up around lots of different communities and perspectives makes it clear that every vote should carry real weight, but smaller and more rural areas also deserve confidence they won\u2019t be steamrolled. A practical bridge is keeping state-based representation while adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or a proportional allocation of electoral votes, plus ranked-choice voting to reduce \u201cspoiler\u201d outcomes. That kind of reform strengthens legitimacy and participation without erasing the federal balance people value.",
    "3": "A system meant to balance regions and prevent runaway power should be updated so every vote carries comparable weight, whether cast in a big city or out in the country. A practical bridge is to keep the state-based structure but allocate electors proportionally (or use a national popular vote compact) while strengthening paper-audit standards and access so elections are trusted and transparent. That kind of reform honors local voices and stable governance without leaving millions feeling their ballots don\u2019t amount to a hill of beans.",
    "41": "Having worked in a system where every patient\u2019s voice deserves to be heard and outcomes improve when standards are consistent, it makes sense to strengthen the link between votes cast and results while still respecting regional concerns. A practical bridge would be a national popular vote with clear, uniform voting rules\u2014or, short of that, reforms like proportional allocation of electors and expanded access to voting\u2014to reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions and make close elections feel legitimate. Any change should prioritize transparency, broad participation, and public trust over partisan advantage.",
    "4": "The current system could be modernized so every vote carries similar weight while still honoring the federal balance that many families value in a large, diverse country. A practical bridge would be a national popular vote with ranked-choice ballots, or a proportional allocation of electors, so close races feel fairer and candidates must earn support across communities rather than only in swing states. After all, democracy works best when the rules are clear, the outcome is trusted, and no one feels like their voice is lost in the noise.",
    "32": "The electoral college should be adjusted in ways that respect federalism and local voices while ensuring every lawful vote carries comparable weight, such as requiring states to allocate electors proportionally and strengthening clear, uniform election standards. A workable compromise could pair these reforms with stronger civic transparency and safeguards against fraud, so confidence in elections grows without dismissing concerns about big states dominating. Any change should be practical, stable, and focused on keeping families and communities confident that outcomes are fair and predictable.",
    "45": "After years of coordinating complex hospital operations where every department must have a meaningful voice and outcomes are measured by real-world impact, elections should similarly balance broad participation with clear, trusted results. Reforms that keep state-by-state traditions but reduce distortion\u2014such as a national popular vote compact, ranked-choice voting, or proportional allocation of electoral votes\u2014could preserve local influence while ensuring the winner reflects the most voters. Any change should prioritize transparency, security, and public confidence, so people across parties feel the system rewards participation rather than geography.",
    "36": "Having watched civic education shift over the years, there\u2019s value in preserving a system that respects states and rural communities, but reforms should ensure every ballot feels equally meaningful. A sensible bridge could be a national popular vote reached through an interstate compact or a proportional allocation of electors, paired with clearer national standards for access and recounts. That approach keeps the federal character of elections while lowering the temperature and giving voters in every region a fairer stake in the outcome.",
    "33": "A fairer system should make every vote count more equally while still respecting the voice of smaller and rural communities, so reforms like a national popular vote compact or proportional allocation of electors deserve serious consideration. Keeping the current structure but reducing \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d outcomes and strengthening voting access in every state could build trust across party lines. As one beloved line puts it, \u201cla justicia se mide en el trato,\u201d and elections should reflect that same dignity for every family\u2019s ballot.",
    "15": "The Electoral College could be kept but modernized so every vote feels meaningful while smaller states still have a real voice. A national popular vote baseline, paired with proportional allocation of electors and stronger uniform standards for ballot access and counting, would protect fairness without erasing federal balance. Reforms should aim for transparency, fewer winner-take-all distortions, and rules that encourage broad, unifying campaigns rather than just chasing a handful of swing states.",
    "5": "With experience helping people who feel unheard and frustrated, any electoral system should make it clear that every vote matters while still respecting the role states play in holding the country together. Reforms like a national popular vote with ranked-choice ballots, or a proportional allocation of electoral votes with stronger voting-access standards, could reduce \u201cswing state\u201d politics without erasing local voices. A fair compromise should prioritize broad participation, transparency, and outcomes that feel legitimate to both big cities and rural communities.",
    "23": "Given a belief in evidence-based systems and fair outcomes, the current electoral college could be modernized to better reflect the popular will while preserving incentives for broad, nationwide coalitions. A practical bridge is a national popular vote implemented through the interstate compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform voting standards and strong protections for rural and smaller-state access to campaigns. The goal should be legitimacy and trust\u2014so every vote matters, no region is ignored, and the winner is clearly supported by the most voters.",
    "7": "Living close to the land makes it clear that every community\u2014rural or urban\u2014deserves a voice, but that voice should carry equal weight and earn broad legitimacy. Reforms should keep safeguards against big-region dominance while moving toward a national popular vote standard, such as proportional allocation of electors with ranked-choice ballots and an interstate compact once enough states join. Clear, uniform voting access and verified paper trails would help both sides trust outcomes while ensuring leaders must appeal beyond partisan bases to the people affected by their decisions.",
    "44": "Given how much trust depends on clear rules and consistent outcomes, the system for choosing a president should minimize ambiguity while ensuring every vote carries comparable weight. A practical bridge is a national popular vote with uniform standards for counting and access, paired with safeguards that keep smaller states engaged\u2014such as ranked-choice voting and regional thresholds that encourage broad, cross-state coalitions. Reforms should be phased in with bipartisan oversight and transparent audits so confidence in the result matters as much as the result itself.",
    "0": "Trust in elections grows when every voter feels their ballot carries equal weight and communities\u2014urban, suburban, and rural\u2014believe they\u2019re seen. Reforms like a national popular vote with ranked-choice voting, or proportional allocation of electors within states, could better reflect the public will while still rewarding broad, cross-regional coalitions. Any change should be paired with strong civic education and transparent administration so people across the political spectrum can have confidence in the outcome and the process.",
    "43": "A system that values both fair representation and the voices of smaller communities should modernize presidential elections by aligning outcomes more closely with the national popular vote while preserving incentives for candidates to engage beyond major metro areas. Practical reforms\u2014such as the National Popular Vote compact, proportional allocation of electors, or ranked-choice voting within states\u2014can reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions and build broader legitimacy without dismissing federalist concerns. Whatever path is chosen should prioritize transparency, voter confidence, and campaigns that compete for every ballot, not just a handful of swing states.",
    "26": "The electoral college could be modernized by adopting a national popular vote through an interstate compact or by awarding electoral votes proportionally, so every ballot carries meaningful weight while still respecting the federal structure. Clear, uniform voting standards and nonpartisan redistricting would help restore trust and reduce the sense that outcomes are pre-decided in a handful of states. A fair system, like good stewardship in the outdoors, should reward broad participation and balance local voices with the principle that the most votes ought to win.",
    "30": "A system that protects minority voices while still honoring the popular will would strengthen trust in elections, especially in a country where people move, work, and build families across state lines. Reforms like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, proportional allocation of electors, and clearer nationwide standards for ballot access and recounts could reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions without erasing federalism. The goal should be a result that is both mathematically fair and broadly legitimate\u2014secure enough to withstand scrutiny and simple enough that most voters can explain it without a flowchart.",
    "11": "A healthy democracy works best when people feel their vote matters and the rules are clear, fair, and stable. Rather than scrapping the Electoral College outright, a practical bridge could be national standards that expand access to voting while adjusting the system\u2014through proportional allocation of electors or a national popular vote compact\u2014so outcomes more consistently match the will of the people. That approach respects local voices and state traditions while honoring personal freedom and social responsibility in how leaders are chosen.",
    "19": "Working around people from all over and seeing how much daily life depends on fair rules, the best path is an election system where every vote counts the same no matter the ZIP code. Keeping state influence can still matter, but reforms like the National Popular Vote compact or proportional allocation of electors would better match outcomes to the popular will while respecting local voices. That kind of middle-ground change can reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d drama, build trust, and make it easier for people to accept results even when their side loses.",
    "17": "A fair voting system should make every ballot count equally while still respecting that communities have different needs, and the current Electoral College too often makes outcomes hinge on a few swing states. A practical bridge is moving toward a national popular vote through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with uniform standards for access and election security that both parties can trust. If the Electoral College remains, reforms like proportional allocation of electors (or district-based methods with strong anti-gerrymandering rules) and clearer recount procedures could reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions while preserving federalism concerns.",
    "35": "The electoral college could be kept but improved so every vote feels meaningful, by reducing winner-take-all rules and encouraging proportional allocation while preserving a clear role for the states. Clear, consistent standards for election administration and transparent recount processes would build trust across communities and lower the temperature of partisan fights. Any reform should protect family and community stability by ensuring elections are fair, secure, and easy to understand, so people of different views can accept the results with confidence.",
    "46": "Given the stakes that public policy has for healthcare, research funding, and everyday well-being, election outcomes should track the popular will while still protecting regional voices from being ignored. A pragmatic reform would keep the Electoral College\u2019s federalist structure but allocate electors proportionally by state (with an automatic recount threshold and uniform standards), reducing winner-take-all distortions without erasing state-based representation. Pairing that with the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once a clear consensus emerges could offer a data-driven, stepwise path that respects tradition while improving legitimacy and trust across political divides.",
    "27": "Living on a modest paycheck makes it clear that every vote should carry the same weight, so shifting toward a national popular vote with ranked-choice voting and consistent, accessible election rules would feel fairer and build broader support. At the same time, concerns about smaller states being ignored are real, which is why pairing reform with protections like uniform voting access, debate requirements that include rural issues, and limits on gerrymandering could help keep everyone at the table. The goal should be an election system that rewards candidates for earning support across communities, not just winning a few swing states.",
    "8": "A healthy democracy should make every vote feel equally meaningful while still respecting the realities of states, regions, and rural communities, and that balance is worth pursuing without turning elections into zero-sum fights. Reforms like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or a proportional allocation of electoral votes within states could keep the federal structure intact while reducing \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions and rewarding broad, cross-regional support. Pairing any change with strong voting access, transparent rules, and civic education would help people across parties trust that outcomes reflect both the will of the people and the character of the union.",
    "24": "Having seen how hard working families depend on stable rules and fair treatment, any change to the Electoral College should protect trust in elections while making every vote feel valued. A reasonable path could keep a role for states but reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d through reforms like proportional allocation or a national popular vote agreement with clear safeguards and transparent recount rules. The goal should be a system that is simple to understand, limits extreme swings, and respects both big cities and smaller communities.",
    "40": "A stable democracy needs election rules that feel fair to voters in both small towns and big cities, and reforms should honor that balance rather than deepen regional resentment. A sensible path is to keep the state-by-state structure but allocate electors proportionally (or by congressional district with strong anti\u2011gerrymandering safeguards), paired with a national standard for ballot access and recounts so close elections are handled consistently. If broader change is desired, the National Popular Vote compact can serve as a practical bridge\u2014strengthening the principle of one person, one vote while preserving federalism without a constitutional rewrite.",
    "38": "Any changes to the Electoral College should protect the country\u2019s stability and respect the voices of smaller states, while still making every citizen feel their vote truly matters. A practical middle path would be to keep the system but require states to award their electoral votes in proportion to the popular vote, with clear nationwide standards for secure elections and simple, transparent recounts. This approach honors tradition and order while reducing the feeling that some votes count less than others.",
    "37": "The Electoral College has value in keeping smaller states from being ignored, but public trust would improve if outcomes more consistently matched the national popular vote. A practical reform could keep the state-based system while adopting proportional allocation in every state and uniform rules for counting and deadlines, so close races feel fair and transparent. That kind of change respects federalism and stability while acknowledging the desire for every vote to carry meaningful weight.",
    "13": "The Electoral College has long balanced the voices of smaller and larger states, and any reform should preserve that stability while strengthening public confidence that every lawful vote is counted fairly. A practical bridge could be a uniform national baseline for voter rules and ballot integrity, paired with requiring electors to follow their state\u2019s popular vote and allocating electoral votes proportionally to better reflect close outcomes. That approach respects federalism and tradition while addressing concerns about fairness and legitimacy on both sides.",
    "31": "The Electoral College\u2019s federalist role can be respected while strengthening public confidence by tightening standards across states and making outcomes more transparent and predictable. A pragmatic middle ground is to keep it but require statewide winner-take-all to be replaced with proportional allocation (or the district method) and uniform, audited election administration, so close races better reflect voter intent without rewriting the Constitution. Clearer rules around recounts, deadlines, and elector certification would reduce gamesmanship and help both sides accept results.",
    "47": "Reforms to the Electoral College should preserve the federal balance that protects smaller states while strengthening public confidence that every vote is fairly counted. A workable bridge is a proportional allocation of electors within each state, paired with uniform election standards, transparent audits, and modernized, secure voting technology to reduce disputes. This approach respects constitutional tradition and encourages broad coalitions, while addressing concerns about winner-take-all outcomes and close-election legitimacy.",
    "48": "Having seen how civic participation works best when every vote feels equally meaningful, reforms should move toward a national popular vote\u2014either by updating the electoral vote allocation to reflect statewide results more fairly or by adopting a compact that honors the overall winner while keeping the states\u2019 administrative role. Any change should protect smaller states\u2019 legitimate interests through clear, uniform voting standards, strong recount rules, and expanded access to the ballot, so trust in outcomes grows across parties. Keeping the focus on fairness, transparency, and stability can bring together those who value tradition with those who want a democracy that matches the public\u2019s choice.",
    "29": "Reforming the electoral college should protect local voices while ensuring every vote carries equal weight, so families in both rural and urban communities feel represented. A practical bridge is a national popular vote with ranked-choice ballots, or a proportional allocation of electors with strong voting-access standards, so outcomes reflect broad support rather than narrow margins. Any change should also include clear, accessible ballots and verification processes that build trust across party lines without shutting eligible voters out.",
    "28": "Having worked closely with teachers and students, it\u2019s clear that civic systems should be transparent, easy to explain, and make every vote feel equally meaningful while still respecting regional voices. A practical compromise could keep the Electoral College\u2019s role but reduce winner-take-all rules through proportional allocation or ranked-choice in each state, paired with stronger national standards for ballot access and election administration. This approach can honor concerns about smaller states being overlooked while addressing the fairness gap that leaves many communities feeling unheard.",
    "42": "Working in a job where accuracy and responsiveness matter makes it clear that trust comes from clear rules and outcomes people can understand. The Electoral College could be kept but modernized with reforms like the National Popular Vote compact or proportional allocation within states, so every vote matters while preserving a meaningful role for states. Common ground starts with making the process more transparent, reducing \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions, and ensuring the result reflects the public\u2019s choice without turning elections into endless recount battles.",
    "14": "The Electoral College should be kept but modernized so it reflects voters more accurately while preserving the balance between states\u2014such as awarding electors proportionally within each state and requiring the winner to secure a clear national mandate. A uniform national standard for ballot access, voter ID, and transparent audits would build confidence across the spectrum without expanding federal micromanagement of elections. Reforms should prioritize simple, verifiable rules and equal treatment for every lawful vote, whether cast in a big city or a small town.",
    "25": "A fair election system should make every vote count while still respecting the role of states and rural communities, and that balance matters to families who work hard, pay taxes, and want their kids to have equal opportunity. A practical reform could keep the Electoral College but require explainable, nationwide standards\u2014like allocating electors proportionally and using ranked-choice voting\u2014so outcomes better match the popular will without ignoring smaller states. That kind of middle path can lower the temperature, build trust, and keep people laughing together instead of tearing each other apart.",
    "9": "The way leaders are chosen should feel fair to families who work hard and still worry about basics, so every vote ought to carry similar weight no matter the state. Keeping a role for states can still matter, but reforms like a national popular vote compact or proportional allocation of electors would better match the people\u2019s choice while reducing \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d fights. Clearer, simpler rules and easier access to voting can help everyone trust the outcome, whether they care more about local voice or national equality.",
    "52": "A fairer presidential election should make every vote feel equally meaningful while still respecting the real differences between states and communities. Reforms like awarding electoral votes proportionally within each state or using the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact could reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions without erasing federalism. Any change should prioritize transparency, broad participation, and trust in outcomes, so people across the political spectrum can feel the system is both legitimate and stable.",
    "21": "A fairer presidential election should make every vote count equally while still respecting that communities in smaller and rural states don\u2019t want to be ignored. Replacing the Electoral College with a national popular vote\u2014phased in through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, along with ranked-choice voting\u2014would strengthen legitimacy and reduce the \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d feeling that leaves many people disengaged. If full replacement isn\u2019t possible yet, expanding the House and allocating electoral votes proportionally would be a practical step that honors both representation and unity.",
    "16": "A pragmatic path forward is to keep the Electoral College\u2019s role in certifying outcomes while aligning it more tightly with the national popular will through reforms like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, proportional allocation of electors, and uniform post-election audit standards. This balances the desire for equal representation across states with a clear, engineering-style focus on system reliability: transparent rules, predictable outcomes, and fewer single-point failures like faithless electors. Reforms should reduce winner-take-all distortions and strengthen confidence in the process without rewriting the entire constitutional framework overnight.",
    "53": "A system meant to balance state and popular interests should be updated so every vote carries comparable weight without erasing the role of states in close contests. Reforms like a national popular vote compact, proportional allocation of electors, and expanded ranked-choice voting could reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions, encourage broader coalition-building, and strengthen legitimacy. Clear, consistent voting standards and protections across states would further ensure outcomes reflect the electorate while preserving federalist guardrails.",
    "51": "The presidential election system should preserve the balance between states while strengthening public confidence through clearer, more uniform rules. A practical reform would keep the electoral college but require states to award electors proportionally or by congressional district, paired with nationwide standards for ballot access, recounts, and voter verification so every community feels the process is fair. This approach respects federalism and tradition while reducing \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions that leave many voters feeling unheard.",
    "56": "Having spent years in healthcare where every patient\u2019s voice and safety mattered, elections should balance fairness with stability so people trust the outcome. Reforms that keep a federal role for states while better matching the national popular vote\u2014such as awarding electoral votes by district or through a proportional method, paired with clear nationwide standards for voting access and counting\u2014could reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions without erasing smaller communities\u2019 influence. The goal should be a system that feels simple, transparent, and legitimate to both rural and urban voters.",
    "50": "Growing up in a place where people come from everywhere, it\u2019s clear why some want every vote to carry the same weight while others worry about smaller communities being ignored. A practical bridge would be a national popular vote with ranked-choice voting, paired with clear statewide standards for access and recounts so close elections feel legitimate everywhere. If the Electoral College remains, reforms like proportional allocation of electors and ending winner-take-all rules could reduce \u201cswing state\u201d dominance while still respecting states\u2019 roles.",
    "58": "A system for choosing the president should balance fairness for individual voters with respect for the distinct interests of states, much like good engineering balances competing requirements without sacrificing safety. Reforms such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or awarding electors proportionally by state could preserve federalism while reducing \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions and making every vote matter. Clear, consistent rules\u2014paired with strong safeguards for election integrity\u2014can help people across the spectrum trust outcomes even when their side loses.",
    "20": "A fair presidential election should honor both the principle of one person, one vote and the reality that rural and smaller-state communities want to be heard, so reform should aim to reduce distortion without erasing regional voice. The most practical bridge is a national popular vote with strong state-level administration\u2014such as allocating electors by congressional district with ranked-choice voting and uniform standards for access and recounts\u2014so winners reflect broad support while preserving local accountability. Any change should be phased in transparently, with safeguards against partisan manipulation and investments in secure, modern voting technology that expands participation for seniors and people with disabilities.",
    "65": "Any reform to the Electoral College should preserve the federal balance that protects smaller states while strengthening public confidence through clearer, more uniform rules and fewer incentives for partisan gamesmanship. A practical bridge would pair nationwide standards for ballot access, recounts, and election security with a proportional allocation of electoral votes within states, so outcomes track the popular will more closely without discarding the state-based structure. That approach respects constitutional tradition and local voice while addressing fairness concerns that fuel distrust on both sides.",
    "67": "Growing up watching how turnout and community voices can get overshadowed by math on a map, it makes sense to modernize the Electoral College so every vote carries similar weight while keeping the system stable. A practical bridge would be a national popular vote with clear standards for fair districting and easier access to voting, or\u2014at minimum\u2014proportional allocation of electors with ranked-choice ballots to encourage broader support. These reforms can respect local interests and reduce polarization, while making outcomes feel more legitimate to people across the political spectrum.",
    "60": "A practical reform would keep the goal of statewide representation while making the outcome better match the popular will, such as allocating electors proportionally or using ranked-choice national tallies. That approach respects concerns about smaller states being ignored but reduces the \u201call-or-nothing\u201d swing-state dynamic that leaves too many voters feeling written off. Clear, uniform voting rules and automatic audits would help everyone trust the result, no matter which party wins.",
    "54": "The presidency should be decided in a way that makes every vote feel equally valued, while still respecting the distinct voices of rural and smaller states that fear being overlooked. A sensible bridge is a national popular vote with ranked-choice ballots, paired with clear, uniform election standards and protections so that close outcomes are trusted and recounts are fair. If a full switch feels too abrupt, an interim reform could award electoral votes proportionally in each state to reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions and encourage broader, more unifying campaigns.",
    "63": "Any reform to the Electoral College should preserve the balance between states while making the outcome feel straightforward and fair to voters, especially in places that rarely see campaign attention. A practical middle ground would be setting national standards for ballot access and election administration, and encouraging states to award electors by congressional district with clear recount rules to reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions. Change should be cautious, transparent, and focused on strengthening trust in results rather than chasing partisan advantage.",
    "66": "Keeping the electoral college can still make sense for balancing big-city and small-town voices, but it should be modernized so every vote feels like it counts and outcomes are trusted. States could adopt a proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote compact to reduce winner-take-all blowouts while respecting federalism. Clear, uniform rules and stronger transparency\u2014like reliable audits and cleaner voter rolls\u2014would help people on both sides accept results and move on together.",
    "34": "Reforming the electoral college should prioritize equal representation while preserving trust in the system, such as adopting a national popular vote with ranked-choice voting or allocating electors proportionally to better reflect every ballot. Clear, uniform voting standards and strong auditability across states would strengthen legitimacy, reduce incentives for extreme partisanship, and address concerns about close elections. A calmer, fairer process can honor both the principle of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d and the desire many have to ensure smaller states are not simply ignored.",
    "61": "Working in a customer-facing job makes it clear how frustrated people get when they feel their vote doesn\u2019t carry the same weight, so the system should be updated to better match the national popular will. A practical bridge is to keep states involved but adopt a national popular vote compact or proportional allocation of electors, plus stronger voting access and transparent recount standards so everyone trusts the outcome. That approach respects federalism while making elections feel fairer and less like a handful of swing states decide for everyone.",
    "76": "The way votes translate into leadership should feel fair and inclusive, while still recognizing that smaller communities worry about being overlooked. Reforms like a national popular vote compact or proportional allocation of electors could better align outcomes with the will of the people without erasing local voices. Whatever replaces or modifies the system should be transparent, protect equal access to the ballot, and be stable enough that everyone can trust the results.",
    "70": "Stability and respect for the states have long helped the country accept close elections, so reforms should focus on strengthening trust rather than scrapping the Electoral College outright. A sensible bridge would keep the state-based framework but require every state to allocate electors proportionally (or by district) and adopt clear, uniform election standards, making outcomes feel fairer to both large and small states. Adding transparency and an automatic recount process in tight contests could further reassure voters across the political spectrum that every lawful ballot is handled carefully.",
    "78": "The electoral college has value in preserving a federal balance and ensuring smaller states are not ignored, but it should better reflect the will of voters and reduce the chance that a close election feels illegitimate. A practical reform would keep the state-based framework while moving toward broader use of the National Popular Vote compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access and counting. That approach respects tradition and stability while answering the widespread desire for fairness and transparency across party lines.",
    "68": "Having spent years listening closely to people\u2019s stories and weighing data alongside lived experience, election rules should balance equal representation with trust that every vote matters. Reforms could keep a federal structure while ensuring the national popular vote is reflected\u2014through a uniform ranked-choice national vote, proportional allocation of electors, or a National Popular Vote compact once enough states join\u2014so close elections feel legitimate across regions. Whatever the path, the goal should be a system that protects individual freedom, rewards broad coalition-building, and strengthens community confidence in the outcome.",
    "74": "The electoral college made sense when travel and communication were slow, but today it leaves too many voters feeling sidelined and fuels distrust in close elections. A practical bridge is to keep the state-by-state structure people value while moving toward a national popular vote outcome through reforms like the National Popular Vote compact, ranked-choice voting, and clear, uniform rules for counting and recounts. Those changes would make results feel fairer, reduce extreme campaigning, and still respect local voices without blowing up the whole system.",
    "73": "Having watched public service and environmental safeguards rise and fall with narrow swings in presidential politics, reforms should keep local voices meaningful while ensuring every ballot carries equal weight. A national popular vote with a ranked-choice system, or a proportional allocation of electors within each state, could reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions and encourage broader, less divisive campaigning. Clear national standards for voting access and transparent election administration would help build trust across regions while protecting the long-term public good.",
    "75": "Given how many families rely on stable, affordable health coverage and a functioning public system, elections should feel fair and count the same no matter where someone lives. A practical reform would keep a state-based structure while awarding electoral votes by a transparent national popular vote, or at least proportionally within each state, so outcomes match the will of voters without sidelining smaller communities. Clear, uniform rules and better ballot access would help build confidence across party lines and reduce the sense that the system is rigged.",
    "80": "A system that chooses the president should balance the voices of smaller states with the basic expectation that the candidate with the most votes wins, and it should do so with clear, verifiable rules that build trust. Reforms like awarding electors proportionally or through an interstate compact tied to the national popular vote could preserve federalism while reducing \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d outcomes and making every vote matter. Any change should be phased in carefully, with strong auditing standards and broad bipartisan agreement, so the process feels fair to both rural and urban communities.",
    "62": "Years of working with individuals and families in crisis make it clear that people trust systems that feel fair, transparent, and responsive, and elections should meet that same standard. Reforms to the Electoral College should protect national unity while ensuring every vote carries comparable weight\u2014such as expanding the House, adopting ranked-choice voting with a national popular vote compact, or setting clearer rules to reduce faithless electors. Respect for local communities can coexist with a stronger commitment to equal representation by modernizing how votes translate into outcomes. A practical path forward is one that lowers incentives to ignore \u201csafe\u201d states and strengthens confidence across the political spectrum.",
    "1": "The Electoral College made more sense in an earlier era of slower communication, but in a modern democracy every vote should feel equally consequential while still respecting the federal nature of the country. A pragmatic reform would keep state-based administration yet reduce winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or via ranked-choice within states, paired with clear national standards for access, recounts, and election security. That approach can honor small-state concerns without treating close races as zero-sum and can make outcomes better reflect the popular will while maintaining broad legitimacy across parties.",

Al mismo tiempo, se puede mantener un equilibrio estatal corrigiendo desigualdades: repartir los electores de forma proporcional, eliminar el \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d y asegurar acceso al voto para personas mayores y con discapacidad.

This approach respects federalism and rural concerns while affirming the democratic principle that every vote should carry comparable weight.",
    "71": "Given a long career in public service and education, legitimacy and equal representation matter, so the Electoral College should be modified to better align outcomes with the national popular will while preserving stability in close races. A practical bridge is a National Popular Vote approach with uniform ballot standards, automatic recount thresholds, and ranked-choice voting to ensure majority support, alongside protections that keep rural and smaller-state concerns from being ignored through targeted federal investment and fair districting. This kind of reform can honor the principle that every vote should carry the same weight while respecting those who value the federal system and worry about sudden, sweeping change.",
    "55": "A fairer presidential election should better match the national popular will while still ensuring smaller and rural communities feel heard, since trust in the outcome matters as much as the outcome itself. Replacing the current system with a national popular vote\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting and uniform voting standards\u2014could reduce \u201cwasted\u201d votes and increase legitimacy without erasing regional concerns.

That kind of reform respects local representation without ignoring concerns about close elections and public confidence.",
    "85": "Having seen how rules and incentives shape behavior in everyday work, it makes sense to keep what promotes broad participation while fixing what feels unfair or out of step with modern expectations. A practical bridge would be a national popular vote with ranked-choice voting, or at least uniform standards and a proportional allocation of electors in every state, so candidates still have reasons to listen beyond big cities and swing states. Pairing any change with clear, consistent election administration and transparency can reassure people who value tradition while addressing concerns about legitimacy and equal representation.",
    "89": "A fair democracy should make every vote count equally while still ensuring smaller states and diverse regions feel heard, so reforms like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or allocating electoral votes proportionally could bridge that gap without abruptly rewriting the system. Clear nationwide standards for voting access and counting would strengthen trust and reduce claims of favoritism, regardless of party. The goal should be an outcome that reflects the people\u2019s choice while preserving stability and legitimacy across the country.",
    "86": "Any reform to the Electoral College should keep faith with the idea that smaller states deserve a real voice, while also making sure every lawful vote is counted clearly and fairly. A practical middle ground would be to require states to award electors by congressional district with the remaining two electors going statewide, paired with stronger, uniform election-security standards and transparent audits. That approach can reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d blowouts, calm fears about fraud, and still preserve the federal balance many people value.",

A reform that rewards broad, consensus-building campaigns\u2014rather than narrow swings in a few places\u2014would feel like a calmer, more decent way to choose a president.",
    "98": "The Electoral College can be preserved to protect federalism and ensure smaller states retain a meaningful voice, while modernizing the process to better reflect the popular will. Reforms like allocating electors by congressional district with a statewide bonus, requiring more uniform election standards, and strengthening post-election audit transparency could reduce controversy without abandoning the constitutional balance. A pragmatic compromise should focus on trust, clarity, and legitimacy so close elections feel fair to both urban and rural voters.",
    "79": "A fairer presidential election should ensure every vote carries similar weight while still respecting the realities of diverse regions and communities. Replacing the winner-take-all approach with a national popular vote supported by ranked-choice voting, or allocating electoral votes proportionally with clear standards, could reduce polarization and make outcomes feel legitimate to more people. Stronger voting access and transparent rules across states would help build trust, balancing local voices with the principle of equal representation.",

The goal should be outcomes that feel legitimate to urban and rural communities alike, so families and workplaces can trust the system and move forward together.",

For those who value the federal balance, an incremental path\u2014such as allocating electors proportionally or through the National Popular Vote compact\u2014could reduce distortions without abruptly discarding the current framework.",
    "769": "Keeping the Electoral College but making it fairer could bridge the gap between people who want every vote to count the same and those who worry about small or rural areas being ignored. Reforms like a national popular vote with a uniform baseline of voting access, or proportional allocation of electors with clear recount rules, would reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions without turning elections into a one-size-fits-all system. Any change should prioritize simple, transparent rules that limit partisan gamesmanship and respect local control while ensuring the outcome matches the public\u2019s choice as closely as possible.",
    "778": "A healthy democracy should make every vote feel equally meaningful, which is why reforms like a national popular vote compact or proportional allocation of electors deserve serious consideration while preserving a state-based role in close, contested elections.

A practical bridge could be a proportional allocation of electors in every state, paired with stronger safeguards for ballot access and election integrity, so close races reflect more voters without turning campaigns into big-city-only contests. That kind of update respects tradition while trimming the rough edges that leave people feeling the system is unfair.",
    "779": "Any reform to the Electoral College should keep the promise that every community matters while making sure each vote carries similar weight and outcomes match the will of the people. A practical bridge could be a national popular vote with clear, uniform standards, plus ranked-choice voting to reduce \u201cspoiler\u201d fears and give independent-minded voters more real options.

A national popular vote with a ranked-choice ballot, implemented through an interstate compact or constitutional amendment, could reduce the zero-sum incentives of winner-take-all while still encouraging candidates to compete beyond a handful of battleground states. Common ground lies in protecting local interests through clear, transparent rules and robust election administration, while aligning outcomes more closely with the electorate\u2019s collective will.",
    "750": "The Electoral College should be kept, but modernized so every lawful vote is counted fairly and trust is restored\u2014stronger voter ID standards, clear nationwide rules, and a transparent audit trail would help.

To bridge concerns about small-state influence, reforms could include the National Popular Vote compact or proportional allocation of electors in every state, so outcomes reflect broader consensus instead of winner-take-all swings. Any change should be paired with stronger voting access and transparency, because legitimacy depends on people trusting that the rules are consistent and the result matches the public will.",
