    "0": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for human dignity, compassion for families in difficult situations, and a commitment to evidence-based healthcare that protects people\u2019s safety and autonomy. I believe we can honor deeply held moral convictions while still ensuring timely access to medical care, clear information, and practical supports like prenatal care, contraception, and adoption services. The goal should be fewer crises and more healthy outcomes\u2014through prevention, education, and strong community resources rather than punishment.",
    "40": "I believe laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal conscience and family circumstances, while also taking seriously the value many people place on unborn life. We can find common ground by keeping the focus on reducing unwanted pregnancies through accurate information and support, and by ensuring compassionate, timely medical care when difficult situations arise. Clear, workable rules should protect patients and clinicians, make room for moral disagreement, and prioritize safety over politics.",
    "2": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy, medical reality, and compassion for the many complicated circumstances people face, while also taking seriously the moral weight that others attach to potential life. I support keeping decisions primarily between a patient and their healthcare provider, with policies that reduce unwanted pregnancies through education, contraception access, and strong support for prenatal care, parents, and adoption. Even when we disagree, we can agree that fewer crises and healthier families are goals worth building laws around.",
    "11": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for life, compassion for the real circumstances people face, and the belief that personal freedom comes with responsibility. I think we can find common ground by focusing on reducing unwanted pregnancies through honest education, strong prenatal and postpartum support, and accessible healthcare, while keeping room for conscience and careful medical judgment in difficult cases. Whatever the law says, it should aim to lower harm, protect women\u2019s health, and help families feel supported rather than shamed.",
    "12": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a sincere respect for both human life and the real, sometimes heartbreaking circumstances that lead someone to consider ending a pregnancy. I believe we can protect unborn life while also expanding practical supports\u2014good prenatal care, counseling, adoption resources, and help for families\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into an impossible choice. Whatever the legal line is, it should be clear, compassionate, and honest about medical realities, and it should leave room for conscience, accountability, and genuine care.",
    "19": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal conscience, real-world health needs, and the reality that pregnancy can bring complicated, urgent situations that don\u2019t fit neat rules. I believe we can protect potential life by investing in contraception, honest sex education, prenatal care, and support for parents\u2014while also keeping decisions about a pregnancy primarily between the person, their doctor, and their faith or values. Even when people disagree morally, we can agree that no one should be forced into dangerous situations or punished for seeking medical care.",
    "24": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for life, compassion for women in difficult situations, and a commitment to real support before and after any decision is made. I believe we can find common ground by focusing on fewer crises in the first place\u2014better prenatal care, counseling, and practical help for families\u2014while also recognizing that people carry deep moral convictions on this issue. Whatever the law says, it should encourage responsibility, protect the vulnerable, and treat everyone with dignity rather than shame.",
    "35": "I believe laws on abortion should start from a deep respect for human life while also recognizing that families can face painful, complicated situations that deserve compassion, privacy, and real support. Even when we disagree, we can come together around practical steps that reduce abortions by helping women and families with prenatal care, counseling, adoption support, and the financial help needed to welcome a child. Any policy should be clear, protect both mother and baby, and be shaped with honesty, mercy, and a commitment to strengthening families.",
    "17": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal medical decisions, grounded in reliable health science, and shaped with compassion for the real-life situations people face. I also think there\u2019s room for common ground by focusing on practical steps most of us can support\u2014better access to contraception, clear sex education, and prenatal and childcare support\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into an impossible choice. Whatever the legal framework, it should prioritize safety, privacy, and dignity rather than punishment or politics.",
    "26": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal freedom, medical reality, and compassion for the complicated situations people face, while recognizing that many approach this issue with sincere moral convictions. I\u2019d focus on keeping decisions primarily between a patient and their doctor, ensuring access to accurate information, contraception, and support for parents, so fewer people are forced into crisis choices. Even when we disagree, we can agree that policies should reduce harm, protect health and privacy, and treat people with dignity.",
    "21": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy, real-life health needs, and compassion for the complicated situations people face. I believe we can protect individual freedom while also reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies through better sex education, affordable contraception, and strong support for parents\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into a decision. Even when we disagree morally, we can agree that policies should keep people safe, treat them with dignity, and be shaped by medical evidence rather than shame.",
    "15": "Laws on abortion should start from a deep respect for human life while also facing the real, sometimes painful situations families encounter, especially when a mother\u2019s health is at risk. I believe we can find common ground by working to reduce abortions through practical support\u2014good prenatal care, adoption resources, and financial and workplace help\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into that choice. Clear limits paired with compassion and strong safety nets can protect both the unborn and the well-being of women and families.",
    "39": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy, compassion in hard circumstances, and clear medical evidence, with room for families and doctors to make deeply private decisions without fear. I believe we can find common ground by focusing on reducing unwanted pregnancies through real support\u2014education, contraception, prenatal and maternal care, and help for parents\u2014while keeping the law from turning complex, human situations into one-size-fits-all punishment. Protecting health and dignity, and meeting people with practical support instead of judgment, is the best path forward.",
    "25": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for life, compassion for families in crisis, and the freedom to make deeply personal medical decisions without politics taking over. I believe the best approach is to reduce unwanted pregnancies through real support\u2014accurate sex education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal and childcare resources\u2014while protecting women\u2019s health and allowing room for conscience. We can hold moral disagreements and still agree that no one should be forced into impossible situations and that children and parents deserve a fair shot at stability.",
    "7": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy, sound medical evidence, and the real-world circumstances families face, especially when a pregnancy is complicated or resources are tight. I\u2019m drawn to approaches that reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through practical support\u2014good healthcare, contraception access, and paid leave\u2014while keeping the decision between a patient, their family, and their doctor. Even when people disagree morally, we can meet on the ground of compassion and responsibility: fewer crises, healthier parents, and healthier kids.",
    "14": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a respect for individual freedom and privacy, while also taking seriously the moral weight many people place on potential life. I\u2019d rather see clear, limited rules early on, paired with real support\u2014honest medical information, access to contraception, and help for parents\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into this decision. If we focus on reducing harm and keeping government from overreaching, we can make room for sincere differences without turning neighbors into enemies.",
    "5": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal conscience and bodily autonomy, while also taking seriously the moral weight many people attach to pregnancy and potential life. I think the most workable path is protecting access early on, ensuring real support for parents and families, and setting clear, medically grounded rules later in pregnancy that prioritize health and compassion. Even when we disagree, we can share a goal of fewer crises and more choices by expanding contraception, honest education, and affordable healthcare.",
    "32": "I believe laws on abortion should start from the conviction that every human life has dignity and deserves protection, while also recognizing the real fear and hardship that can surround an unexpected pregnancy. We should work toward policies that reduce abortions by expanding practical support\u2014prenatal care, counseling, financial help, and adoption resources\u2014so fewer families feel trapped by circumstance. Even when people disagree about where the legal line should be, we can agree that the goal is fewer crises, more compassion, and stronger support for mothers, fathers, and children.",
    "43": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy, medical evidence, and compassion for the real-life circumstances families face, while recognizing that many people hold sincere moral convictions about when life begins. I believe the strongest path forward is to protect the ability to make time-sensitive healthcare decisions in consultation with qualified clinicians, and to reduce the need for abortions through better access to contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and economic supports. Even where we disagree, we can agree that decisions should prioritize health, safety, and dignity, and that no one benefits when policy is driven by stigma or political point-scoring.",
    "44": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for individual autonomy, medical evidence, and a realistic understanding that complicated situations don\u2019t fit neatly into one moral box. I believe we can protect the freedom to make deeply personal healthcare decisions while also investing in contraception access, comprehensive sex education, and strong support for parents so fewer people ever feel cornered into that choice. Even when people disagree about when life begins, most of us can agree the goal should be fewer crises, less suffering, and policies grounded in compassion rather than punishment.",
    "29": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal conscience, medical reality, and the responsibility to protect families\u2019 health and futures. I\u2019ve learned that complicated decisions don\u2019t fit neat slogans, so policy should keep politicians out of the exam room while ensuring safe access, clear information, and real support for parents\u2014like childcare, healthcare, and paid leave. Even when people disagree, we can find common ground by reducing harm, honoring deeply held beliefs, and trusting individuals to make the best choice for their own lives.",
    "30": "Laws around abortion should be guided by respect for personal freedom, medical reality, and compassion for families facing complex situations, while also acknowledging that many people wrestle with sincere moral beliefs about fetal life. I favor a framework that keeps decisions primarily between a patient and their doctor, sets clear health-and-safety standards, and supports real alternatives\u2014affordable contraception, prenatal care, and childcare\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into impossible choices. Even when we disagree on where moral lines fall, we can agree the goal should be fewer crises, less suffering, and more support for parents and kids.",
    "34": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy and medical privacy, while recognizing the sincere moral convictions many people bring to this issue. I believe the best path is to keep decisions primarily between a patient and their doctor, set clear health-and-safety standards based on evidence, and invest in supports that reduce unwanted pregnancies\u2014like comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and real help for parents. If we focus on dignity, prevention, and compassion rather than punishment, we can protect freedom while lowering the number of abortions in a way more people can live with.",
    "49": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy, medical reality, and compassion for the tough situations people can be in, rather than politics or shame. I want protections that keep the decision between a person and their healthcare provider, while also making it easier to prevent unwanted pregnancies through real sex education, affordable contraception, and support for parents. If we can agree that fewer crises and healthier families are the goal, then keeping care safe, legal, and paired with strong community resources feels like the most fair, grounded path.",
    "41": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for individual medical decision-making, compassion for complicated real-life circumstances, and a commitment to keeping patients safe. I\u2019ve seen how rarely health choices fit into neat categories, so I support clear, evidence-based rules that protect access early on while allowing exceptions when health or serious hardship is involved. At the same time, we can make common ground by investing in prevention\u2014better sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and maternal care, and support for parents\u2014so fewer people are forced into heartbreaking decisions.",
    "4": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal conscience\u2014recognizing that families can face heartbreaking, complex situations that don\u2019t fit neat slogans. I believe the focus should be on keeping people safe and supported with accurate health information, prenatal care, and real help for parents, while allowing room for sincere moral differences without forcing one set of beliefs on everyone. At the end of the day, we should aim for policies that reduce harm and strengthen families, because we\u2019re all trying to do right by our children and our communities.",
    "46": "Laws on abortion should be guided by the best available medical evidence, respect for personal autonomy, and a clear-eyed understanding that pregnancy decisions can involve complex health risks and family realities. I think we can find common ground by focusing on reducing unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive education and accessible contraception, while ensuring that when someone is facing a difficult situation, they can get timely, safe, and compassionate medical care. Good policy should protect patients and clinicians from political interference and prioritize measurable outcomes\u2014lower maternal harm and healthier families\u2014over slogans.",
    "18": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy, medical reality, and compassion for the complicated situations people face, while keeping decisions centered on patients and clinicians rather than politicians. I believe we can find common ground by protecting life and health through honest education, real support for parents and children, and safeguards that reduce the need for abortion without criminalizing people in crisis. At minimum, the law should preserve access when someone\u2019s health is at risk and ensure timely, evidence-based care, with room for individual conscience and deeply held beliefs.",
    "20": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy, medical realities, and compassion for the complicated circumstances people face, while also recognizing that many hold sincere moral concerns about potential life. I\u2019ve seen how judgment and red tape can deepen hardship, so I favor policies that keep decisions primarily between a patient, their family, and trusted clinicians, with practical supports like contraception, prenatal care, and adoption services available. If we focus on reducing unwanted pregnancies and ensuring no one is forced into unsafe choices, there\u2019s room for people of different convictions to agree on protecting health, dignity, and community well-being.",
    "33": "Laws about abortion should be guided by compassion, medical facts, and respect for families facing painful, complicated situations, with room for personal faith and conscience. I believe we can agree on protecting people\u2019s health and dignity by keeping decisions centered on the pregnant person and their doctor, while expanding support like prenatal care, contraception, and real help for parents so fewer families ever feel cornered. As one of my favorite lines reminds me, \u201cno hay una sola historia,\u201d and our laws should make space for that truth rather than forcing one answer on everyone.",
    "22": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for human life alongside compassion for the real, sometimes devastating situations families face, with clear medical exceptions to protect a mother\u2019s life and health. I also think we\u2019ll make more progress by pairing limits with practical support\u2014affordable prenatal care, help with childcare, and strong adoption and parenting resources\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into an impossible decision. Even when we disagree about where to draw the legal line, we can agree that reducing harm and increasing support should be the goal.",
    "27": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy and real-world health care needs, while also taking seriously the moral weight many people feel around pregnancy. I\u2019ve seen how economic pressure and limited support can box people into impossible choices, so policy should focus on keeping care safe and accessible and expanding things that prevent crisis\u2014sex education, contraception, prenatal care, and help for parents. Even when we disagree, we can at least agree that fewer unwanted pregnancies and more support for families makes outcomes better for everyone.",
    "23": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy and by the best available medical evidence, while also taking seriously the moral weight many people attach to potential life. I\u2019ve seen how complex health situations can be, and I think policy works best when it keeps decisions centered on patients and clinicians rather than politicians, with real support for contraception, prenatal care, and families who choose to carry pregnancies to term. Even when we disagree, we can agree on reducing harm\u2014preventing unwanted pregnancies, ensuring safety, and treating people with dignity.",
    "48": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy and the real-life circumstances families face, while also taking seriously the moral weight many people attach to potential life. I\u2019ve seen how complicated health, finances, and relationships can be, and I don\u2019t think politicians can write one-size-fits-all rules that fit every crisis. We can find common ground by protecting access to safe, timely medical care and honest counseling, while reducing unwanted pregnancies through education and affordable contraception.",
    "3": "Laws on abortion ought to be guided by a steady respect for human life and dignity, while also facing the hard realities families live with\u2014health risks, poverty, and the limits of support when a crisis hits. I can\u2019t stomach turning a deeply personal decision into a political club, so I favor policies that reduce abortions by expanding real help: clear medical guidance, prenatal and mental-health care, paid leave, and adoption support. If we keep compassion at the center and do what works in the real world, we can protect both conscience and care\u2014no need to make it a scorched-earth fight.",
    "1": "Laws on abortion should start from a respect for personal conscience and bodily autonomy, while taking seriously the moral weight many people attach to potential life. I\u2019m drawn to approaches that reduce the need for abortion through real supports\u2014accessible contraception, quality healthcare, and economic stability\u2014rather than criminalizing patients or doctors. A workable policy should protect privacy and medical judgment, set clear and limited boundaries that are grounded in science and compassion, and leave room for people of faith and people of none to live together without forcing one moral framework on everyone.",
    "9": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for women\u2019s lives and health, and by the idea that families deserve the freedom to make private, careful decisions when things are hard. I believe we can honor different beliefs by keeping government out of exam rooms while also expanding real support like affordable healthcare, childcare, and help for parents so no one feels pushed into a choice by money or fear. That kind of approach protects equality and independence, and it\u2019s something people on both sides can understand.",
    "13": "Laws on abortion should start from a shared respect for human life and the reality that pregnancy can bring complicated, painful situations where people need clear information and compassionate support. I believe the law should aim to protect unborn life while also making sure there are reasonable exceptions and that women aren\u2019t left without medical care or counseling when hard cases arise. If we can focus on reducing the number of abortions through practical help\u2014stronger support for moms, adoption services, and responsible sex education\u2014there\u2019s room for people on both sides to move forward together.",
    "16": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for human dignity and a commitment to reducing harm, which means taking seriously both the moral weight many people attach to fetal life and the real-world health, autonomy, and safety needs of pregnant patients. I\u2019d ground policy in clear medical standards, evidence-based timelines, and narrowly tailored limits with exceptions for life and serious health risks, while also investing upstream in contraception access, maternal healthcare, and family supports so fewer people face this decision in crisis. The goal should be a framework that\u2019s predictable, enforceable without intruding on the patient\u2013clinician relationship, and oriented toward better outcomes for families and communities.",
    "31": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for human life and by a sober recognition that these decisions often arise in painful, complicated circumstances. I favor limits that protect the unborn as the pregnancy progresses, paired with clear exceptions for threats to a mother\u2019s life and with practical support\u2014medical care, counseling, and resources\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into an irreversible choice. We won\u2019t agree on every line, but we can agree that society should be honest about the moral stakes while treating women and families with compassion rather than judgment.",
    "28": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy, compassion for complex real-life circumstances, and solid medical evidence, while also encouraging early, accurate information and supportive counseling. I\u2019ve seen how learning and well-being improve when people have stable support systems, so I\u2019d rather policy focus on prevention\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and paid leave\u2014so fewer families face crisis decisions. Even when people disagree morally, we can agree that decisions are safest when made with a qualified healthcare provider and when no one is forced into a choice by poverty, fear, or lack of access.",
    "10": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a deep respect for personal conscience, recognizing that these decisions often come in moments of fear, love, and uncertainty. I believe we can hold space for the value many people place on potential life while still trusting families and doctors to make the safest, most responsible choices without political interference. If we want fewer abortions and healthier outcomes, we should pair legal protections with real support\u2014affordable healthcare, contraception, and resources for parents\u2014so no one feels cornered into a decision.",
    "47": "Laws on abortion should start from a respect for human life while also recognizing that real pregnancies can involve medical crises and heartbreaking circumstances, so the rules need clear, workable protections for mothers\u2019 health and for clinicians acting in good faith. I favor policies that reduce the number of abortions through practical support\u2014strong prenatal care, adoption options, and help for families\u2014while drawing reasonable limits as pregnancies progress. To bridge divides, I think we should focus on shared goals: fewer unintended pregnancies, compassionate care in hard cases, and laws written with enough clarity that people aren\u2019t left guessing when time and health are on the line.",
    "37": "I believe laws on abortion should start from a respect for life, while also facing honestly the hard, personal situations that lead people to consider it. The goal should be to protect unborn children as much as possible and to make room for medical realities, with clear limits and compassion rather than politics and shame. I can support approaches that reduce abortions by expanding practical help\u2014good prenatal care, adoption support, and resources for mothers\u2014so fewer families feel cornered into a choice they never wanted.",
    "36": "I believe laws on abortion should respect the seriousness of ending a potential life while also recognizing that real women and families face painful, complicated situations that can\u2019t be reduced to slogans (and if lawmakers think they can, I\u2019ve got a riddle for them: what\u2019s always certain and never true?). The best guidance starts with protecting life where possible, making room for clear exceptions and compassionate medical judgment, and ensuring women aren\u2019t pushed into impossible choices by lack of support. If we can focus on fewer abortions through better counseling, adoption support, and help for parents\u2014rather than scoring political points\u2014we\u2019ll be closer to laws people can live with.",
    "6": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by respect for life while also recognizing that real pregnancies come with complicated medical and personal circumstances that don\u2019t fit neatly into slogans. Having seen how quickly health situations can change, I want clear limits that protect unborn children, paired with firm exceptions for the mother\u2019s life, serious health threats, and cases like rape or incest, and I also want better support for women\u2014prenatal care, adoption resources, and help for families\u2014so fewer feel cornered into an impossible choice. If we start from the shared goal of reducing abortions and reducing harm, we can write laws that are both compassionate and responsible.",
    "42": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for individual medical decisions, clear limits grounded in health realities, and a real commitment to reducing unwanted pregnancies through education and access to contraception. I\u2019m wary of one-size-fits-all rules that don\u2019t match what people and doctors face in the moment, but I also think it\u2019s fair for the law to reflect that many people value potential life. The best path forward is setting reasonable, evidence-based guardrails while protecting privacy and ensuring compassionate care in the hardest cases.",
    "38": "I believe laws about abortion should be guided by deep respect for life, personal responsibility, and compassion for women facing painful, complicated situations. We can protect unborn children while also making sure mothers have real support\u2014good healthcare, counseling, and practical help\u2014so no one feels pushed into a choice by fear or poverty. Even when people disagree strongly, the goal should be fewer abortions and more care, with clear limits and humane exceptions that reflect both moral conviction and mercy.",
    "45": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy and privacy, while also taking seriously the moral weight many people place on potential life. In my work, I\u2019ve seen how complicated pregnancies and family circumstances can be, so policy should prioritize timely, evidence-based medical care and leave room for clinicians and patients to make the safest decisions. A durable approach protects access early, allows reasonable regulations that don\u2019t create barriers, and supports prevention through contraception, comprehensive sex education, and real resources for parents who choose to continue a pregnancy.",
    "8": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal conscience, with room for families to make deeply private decisions in consultation with trusted healthcare professionals. The best policy focuses on preventing unwanted pregnancies through honest education and access to contraception, while ensuring safety and support when pregnancy becomes complicated or untenable. Even when people disagree morally, we can share a commitment to reducing harm, protecting women\u2019s health, and treating every person involved with dignity.",
    "50": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal conscience, real-life medical realities, and compassion for people facing situations that are often complicated and painful. I\u2019d rather see policy focus on keeping decisions between a patient and their healthcare provider, while also reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies through sex education, affordable contraception, and support for parents who choose to carry to term. Even when people disagree morally, we can agree that no one benefits from shame, dangerous delays in care, or families left without resources.",
    "52": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal autonomy, while also taking seriously the moral weight many people attach to pregnancy. From what I\u2019ve seen, life is messy and circumstances vary, so rigid rules tend to hurt real people\u2014especially when they interfere with timely healthcare. A common ground is protecting access early on, making clear exceptions for health and safety, and investing in prevention through better sex education, affordable contraception, and strong support for parents who choose to continue a pregnancy.",
    "54": "Laws about abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a deep respect for conscience\u2014honoring both the value many people place on unborn life and the lived circumstances of the pregnant person. I believe the best common ground is protecting health and safety, preventing coercion, and keeping decisions grounded in private consultation with medical professionals rather than politics. We can also reduce abortions by supporting prenatal care, contraception, honest sex education, and the practical help that makes carrying a pregnancy possible.",
    "56": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for individual medical decisions, compassion for people facing hard circumstances, and clear standards that keep patients safe and prevent needless suffering. I\u2019ve seen how complicated health and family situations can be, so I trust thoughtful counseling between a patient and clinician more than one-size-fits-all rules. At the same time, I understand many people want to protect potential life, and I think common ground starts with reducing unintended pregnancies, supporting prenatal and child care, and ensuring decisions are made early and with accurate information.",
    "62": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy, medical judgment, and the real-life circumstances families face, while also supporting healthy pregnancies through better access to contraception, prenatal care, and economic stability. I\u2019ve seen how rigid rules can deepen crises and push people toward unsafe choices, so policy should prioritize compassion, privacy, and evidence-based care rather than punishment. Even when people disagree morally, we can find common ground in reducing unintended pregnancies, protecting patients and clinicians, and ensuring no one is forced into a decision by lack of resources.",
    "59": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy, compassion for the complex realities families face, and a commitment to medical evidence rather than ideology. I believe we can protect both moral conscience and public health by keeping decisions centered on patients and clinicians, while also expanding contraception access, prenatal and maternal care, and practical supports that reduce unwanted pregnancies. Even when people disagree about when life begins, we can agree that no one benefits from policies that shame, endanger, or abandon people in crisis.",
    "63": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for human life while also recognizing that complicated pregnancies and crises can leave families facing painful, time-sensitive decisions. I believe we can find common ground by setting clear, consistent limits, while ensuring real exceptions for threats to the mother\u2019s health and for tragic circumstances, and pairing those rules with practical support like prenatal care, adoption resources, and help for parents. The goal should be fewer abortions overall and fewer families feeling cornered, without turning a deeply personal issue into a political weapon.",
    "57": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal conscience, medical judgment, and the real-life circumstances families face, while also encouraging practical supports that reduce the need for abortion in the first place. I believe the government\u2019s role is to keep care safe and accessible, not to criminalize people in crisis, and to pair freedom with responsibility through accurate information, prenatal and postpartum healthcare, childcare, and contraception. Even when we disagree about when life begins, we can agree that compassion, honesty, and fewer tragedies should be the goal.",
    "58": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal freedom and compassion for the real-life complexity families face, while also taking seriously the moral weight many people place on developing life. I believe the best path is reducing unwanted pregnancies through solid sex education, affordable contraception, and strong support for parents, alongside clear, medically grounded protections for women\u2019s health and for tragic, nonviable pregnancies. Even when we disagree, we can agree that decisions should be made with dignity, honest information, and a commitment to justice for both women and children.",
    "61": "I think abortion laws should be guided by respect for personal freedom, real-world healthcare needs, and compassion for the complicated situations people face. I can understand why some want to protect potential life, but I don\u2019t think the government should force one moral choice on everyone\u2014especially when timing, safety, and family circumstances vary so much. A good path forward is keeping abortion safe and legal early on, with clear medical exceptions later in pregnancy and strong support for contraception, prenatal care, and parents who choose to carry to term.",
    "76": "Laws about abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for families facing hard, deeply personal decisions, with room for moral differences without forcing one set of beliefs on everyone. I\u2019ve seen how crucial it is to meet people where they are and protect those who are most vulnerable, so policies should prioritize safety, timely care, and honest counseling rather than punishment or shame. We can find common ground by focusing on preventing unwanted pregnancies through education and access to contraception, supporting parents who choose to carry to term, and ensuring no one is left alone in crisis.",
    "68": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal freedom and the real-world complexity people face, with room for conscience while keeping decisions rooted in medical evidence and compassion. I\u2019ve seen how carefully gathered facts and thoughtful listening can cut through slogans, so I want policies that protect patients\u2019 health, support families with practical resources, and trust individuals to make decisions in consultation with their clinicians.

    "799": "I believe laws on abortion should be guided by respect for human life while also recognizing that real people face complicated, painful situations that can\u2019t be reduced to slogans. To find common ground, I\u2019d focus on clear limits paired with strong support\u2014better prenatal care, adoption options, and real help for women who feel cornered by finances or lack of support. If we can lower the number of abortions through prevention and compassion rather than shame, we\u2019ll be closer to something most people can live with.",
    "782": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a commitment to protect life and dignity while also recognizing the real, sometimes heartbreaking circumstances families face and the need for compassionate medical care. I believe we can find common ground by focusing on fewer unwanted pregnancies through better support for parents, access to healthcare and contraception, and practical help when a pregnancy involves serious medical risk. Whatever the legal framework, it should be clear, consistent, and aimed at reducing harm rather than punishing people in crisis.",
    "785": "I believe laws on abortion should be guided by a deep respect for human life while also recognizing that unexpected pregnancies can bring real fear, health concerns, and complicated family circumstances. We can find common ground by focusing on reducing the number of abortions through practical support\u2014better prenatal care, adoption resources, and help for parents\u2014while also ensuring clear protections when a mother\u2019s life is at risk. If we start from compassion and responsibility instead of politics, I think we can craft laws that protect the vulnerable and treat people facing hard decisions with dignity.",
    "794": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, real-world outcomes for families, and respect for personal conscience, recognizing that these situations are often complex and deeply personal. I want policies that reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through strong support for prenatal and postpartum care, affordable childcare, and easy access to contraception, while also ensuring people can make timely medical decisions in consultation with their doctors. We can honor differing moral views by focusing on practical protections: clear medical exceptions, honest counseling, and resources that make choosing to carry a pregnancy to term genuinely feasible.",
    "775": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal conscience and medical reality, trusting people and their doctors to make decisions that are often complicated and deeply private. I can understand the desire to protect potential life, but I also think the law should prioritize a person\u2019s health, safety, and ability to choose, especially in hard cases and when time matters. The most workable path is clear protections for access early on, strong safeguards for emergencies and severe fetal conditions later, and real support for parents and families so fewer people feel forced into any decision.",
    "792": "Laws on abortion should respect personal freedom and medical privacy while also taking seriously the moral weight many people feel about potential life. From what I\u2019ve seen in patient care, rigid one-size-fits-all rules can miss the realities of health risks, trauma, and complicated family situations, so decisions should stay primarily between the patient and their clinician, with clear protections for safety and informed consent. Common ground is focusing on fewer crises in the first place\u2014better access to contraception, prenatal care, and practical support for parents\u2014so people have real choices, not just legal ones.",
    "786": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by respect for individual autonomy, sound medical evidence, and a realistic understanding of the complex circumstances people face, rather than by ideology alone. I can appreciate the moral gravity many attach to potential life, but I also think public policy works best when it protects bodily integrity, preserves access to safe healthcare, and leaves room for private conscience. A constructive path forward is to safeguard early access, ensure later-term decisions are grounded in serious medical need, and invest in prevention\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust support for families\u2014so fewer people are ever forced into heartbreaking choices.",
    "805": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a respect for individual freedom and the real-world responsibilities families face, while also taking seriously the moral weight many people attach to potential life. I think the common ground is keeping government from making one-size-fits-all decisions, paired with practical support\u2014clear medical standards, access to contraception and prenatal care, and help for parents\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into the hardest choices. When we focus on reducing harm and increasing options instead of scoring points, we can protect both conscience and compassion.",
    "798": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal conscience, medical reality, and a real commitment to reducing harm\u2014especially in complicated pregnancies where delaying care can change lives. I can understand why people hold deep moral convictions on this, so I\u2019d focus policy on keeping decisions in the hands of patients and doctors while investing in practical supports that prevent unwanted pregnancies and make parenting a genuine option. We won\u2019t all agree on when life begins, but we can agree that compassion, honesty, and fewer families in crisis should be the goal.",
    "807": "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the real-life health, dignity, and circumstances of the person who\u2019s pregnant, keeping decisions as close to families and their medical providers as possible. I\u2019m drawn to practical rules that reduce unwanted pregnancies through education and access to contraception, and that provide support for parents who choose to carry to term, because it lowers the stakes and the suffering on all sides. We won\u2019t agree on every moral line, but we can agree that fewer crises, clearer medical exceptions, and compassion\u2014not punishment\u2014should guide policy.",
    "803": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal conscience, medical reality, and compassion for families facing complex, time-sensitive decisions. I believe the goal should be to protect a person\u2019s health and autonomy while also encouraging real support\u2014affordable prenatal care, contraception, and resources for parents\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into impossible choices. Even when we disagree morally, we can agree that decisions are best made with qualified clinicians and loved ones, not politicians, and that policy should reduce harm and treat everyone with dignity.",
    "810": "Laws on abortion should respect the seriousness of bringing a child into the world and the value of protecting life, while also recognizing that some families face heartbreaking medical situations. I\u2019d like to see rules that encourage responsibility and offer real support\u2014prenatal care, adoption services, and help for parents\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into a decision they never wanted. Even when we disagree, we can agree that compassion, clear limits, and practical help for mothers and kids should guide what we do.",
    "801": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for individual conscience and medical reality, while also acknowledging that many people view pregnancy as morally significant and deserving of serious consideration. I support keeping the decision primarily between a patient, their family, and their doctor\u2014especially in cases involving health risks, rape, or fatal fetal conditions\u2014while pairing legal protections with practical supports like prenatal care, contraception, and adoption services. If we focus on reducing unwanted pregnancies and ensuring women aren\u2019t forced into dangerous situations, we can protect both personal freedom and a shared commitment to human dignity.",

I\u2019ve seen how stability and opportunity hinge on access to accurate information and supportive services, so I want policy that protects privacy, prioritizes patient safety, and expands prevention through comprehensive sex education and affordable contraception.

I\u2019m drawn to clear rules that don\u2019t punish people in crisis and that put real help on the table\u2014medical care, counseling, and support for parents who choose to carry to term. Even when we disagree, we can meet in the middle by aiming to reduce abortions through responsibility and compassion, not shame.",

I want policies that reduce the number of abortions through prevention\u2014better education, access to contraception, and strong support for pregnant women\u2014without turning private medical decisions into blanket criminal matters. We should set clear, safety-focused standards that protect health, allow room for conscience, and encourage practical help for families so fewer people feel cornered into a decision they never wanted to face.",
    "812": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal freedom, real medical realities, and the goal of reducing harm\u2014so people can make private decisions with their doctor without fear. I\u2019ve seen how fast a health situation can change, and I think policy should keep care safe, affordable, and available while also putting real resources into contraception, sex education, prenatal care, and support for parents. Even when people disagree morally, we can meet in the middle by focusing on fewer crises, healthier families, and compassion instead of punishment.",
    "813": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal conscience, medical reality, and compassion for the complicated situations families face. I\u2019m drawn to policies that keep the government from forcing one set of beliefs on everyone while still taking prenatal life seriously by expanding practical supports\u2014health care, contraception, prenatal care, and help for parents\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into impossible choices. If we focus on reducing harm and increasing options, I think people who disagree on moral starting points can still agree on dignity, safety, and responsibility.",
    "806": "Laws on abortion should start from respect for human life while also taking seriously the hard realities families face when a pregnancy threatens a mother\u2019s health or comes from tragedy. I believe the best path is clear limits with narrow, compassionate exceptions, paired with real support\u2014prenatal care, adoption resources, and help for mothers who feel they have no options. If we keep the focus on protecting life and reducing suffering instead of scoring political points, we can find policies most people can live with.",
    "811": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for personal autonomy, medical reality, and compassion for the complicated circumstances people face, while recognizing that many hold sincere moral concerns about potential life. I\u2019m drawn to approaches that protect safe, timely care and let patients and doctors\u2014not politicians\u2014make decisions, paired with practical steps that reduce unwanted pregnancies through education, contraception access, and support for families. In studying how societies endure, I\u2019ve seen that durable laws make room for conscience without imposing one belief on everyone, and they focus on reducing harm rather than scoring victories.",

That approach protects life and autonomy by lowering the number of abortions while ensuring that in hard cases, people can make the best decision with their doctors and support system."
