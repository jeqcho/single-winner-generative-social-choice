    "1": "I\u2019m open to replacing the Electoral College with a national popular vote, but I also think any change has to reassure people in smaller or less-populated states that their concerns won\u2019t be drowned out. A practical bridge is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact paired with clear, uniform election standards and automatic recount triggers, so the outcome feels fair and auditable no matter where you live. If we keep the Electoral College, then at least require proportional allocation of electors and eliminate winner-take-all rules that turn too many voters into spectators.",
    "11": "I\u2019d like to see the Electoral College updated so every vote counts more equally while still giving smaller states a real voice\u2014something like awarding electors proportionally and setting clear national standards for fair, accessible elections. That approach keeps the spirit of balance but reduces the \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d pressure that can make people feel ignored and divided. If we can agree that both majority rule and local representation matter, we can reform the system without treating the other side like the enemy.",
    "38": "I believe the Electoral College should be improved, not thrown out, because it helps make sure smaller communities aren\u2019t ignored while big cities decide everything. We could require every state to award its electors based on the statewide popular vote and add clear standards for fair districting and transparent counting so people trust the results. If we focus on simple, consistent rules and respect for every vote, we can protect both local voice and national unity.",
    "45": "I\u2019d like to see the Electoral College reformed so every vote carries more equal weight while still respecting the role of states in our federal system. A practical bridge is a national popular vote with clear, uniform rules for ballot access and counting, paired with strong state-level safeguards and mandatory audits so people across the spectrum can trust the outcome. That approach rewards broad, nationwide support, reduces the \u201cfew swing states decide everything\u201d problem, and keeps the focus on fair process rather than partisan advantage.",
    "14": "I\u2019m open to reforming the Electoral College, but I don\u2019t want a system that makes it easier for a few big cities to call every election while everyone else feels ignored. A practical middle ground is to keep the state role but allocate electors by congressional district or proportional to the statewide vote, with clear national standards for ballot access and counting so every vote is handled the same. That would reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d games, respect local voices, and make the outcome feel more legitimate no matter who wins.",
    "21": "I\u2019d like to see the electoral college reformed so every vote carries the same weight, while still giving smaller states a meaningful voice in national politics. A practical bridge could be adopting a national popular vote through an interstate compact, paired with stronger voting access and clear nationwide standards so people trust the results. The goal isn\u2019t to help one party win\u2014it\u2019s to make outcomes feel fair, transparent, and worth showing up for.",
    "0": "I\u2019m open to reforming the Electoral College so every vote carries more equal weight while still respecting the federal structure that gives states a meaningful role in our elections. A practical bridge could be adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or requiring states to allocate electors proportionally, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access and election administration to build trust. Whatever path we take, the goal should be outcomes that feel legitimate to people in big cities, small towns, and everywhere in between.",
    "5": "I\u2019d like to see the Electoral College replaced with a national popular vote so every ballot counts the same, no matter where you live, but I also get why people worry about smaller states being ignored. A good bridge could be a popular-vote system with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform election rules nationwide, so candidates have to earn broad support instead of just targeting a few swing areas. That feels fairer, reduces the \u201cmy vote doesn\u2019t matter\u201d frustration I hear from people every day, and keeps the focus on building real majority trust.",
    "4": "I\u2019d like to see the electoral college modified so every vote carries more equal weight, while still respecting that smaller states and rural communities deserve to be heard\u2014not treated like an afterthought. A practical middle path is a national popular vote with safeguards like ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform standards for election administration, so campaigns have to earn support broadly instead of just in a few swing states. In the end, the system should feel like \u201cone vote, one value,\u201d because if the process looks unfair, then no one feels the result is fully legitimate.",
    "35": "I believe the system should keep a strong voice for every state while making sure every vote feels equal, so I\u2019d support reforms like requiring states to award electors proportionally or through a national compact once most of the country joins. Clear, uniform election rules and transparent audits would help people trust the results, no matter who wins. That kind of practical compromise can protect local representation without ignoring the national will.",
    "10": "I\u2019d like to see the Electoral College reformed so every vote counts more equally, while still respecting that communities in different parts of the country worry about being overlooked. A practical bridge is a national popular vote paired with strong, transparent election standards and perhaps ranked-choice voting to encourage broader support instead of winner-take-all outcomes. If that\u2019s too big a leap, expanding the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact and apportioning electors proportionally within states would be a fairer step that could earn trust across the aisle.",
    "15": "I value a system that protects local communities from being ignored while still making every vote feel equally meaningful, so I\u2019d support keeping the Electoral College but reforming it with proportional allocation of electors in each state and a stronger commitment to nonpartisan districting. Pairing that with national standards for secure voter registration, paper trails, and transparent audits could build trust across the board. That approach respects federalism and personal freedom while reducing the \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d frustration that divides people.",
    "16": "I\u2019d keep the goal of balancing state interests and national legitimacy, but modernize the system so the winner of the presidency aligns more reliably with the popular vote. A practical path is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or, at minimum, requiring states to allocate electors proportionally with clear, auditable election standards to reduce edge-case outcomes and litigation risk. That preserves federalism and local control while giving voters across red, blue, and swing states confidence their ballots carry comparable weight.",
    "41": "I\u2019m open to reforming the Electoral College in a way that protects confidence in the outcome while making every vote matter more equally, such as adopting a national popular vote with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, and recounts. At the same time, I understand the concern about smaller states being ignored, so I\u2019d support transitional steps like allocating electors proportionally or using ranked-choice voting in states to encourage broader appeal. Whatever the system, it should be simple, transparent, and designed to reduce polarization rather than reward narrow wins.",
    "25": "I understand why some people want the Electoral College to protect smaller states, but I also believe every vote should count as equally as possible and people should feel their voice matters wherever they live. A good bridge could be a national popular vote with a reasonable threshold, plus a backup ranked-choice runoff to ensure the winner has broad support. Short of that, I\u2019d support reforms that reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d by allocating electors proportionally in each state so elections feel fairer without throwing out the whole system.",
    "47": "I\u2019m open to reforms that make presidential elections feel fair and transparent to everyone, but any change should preserve the balance between big population centers and the rest of the country. A practical middle ground is keeping the Electoral College while adopting uniform national standards for voting access and counting, and encouraging states to award electors by congressional district or proportionally rather than winner-take-all. That would make outcomes track the popular vote more closely, reduce the sense that a few swing states decide everything, and still respect the federal structure that helps hold a diverse country together.",
    "29": "I want a presidential election system that makes every vote matter equally while still giving smaller states and rural communities confidence they won\u2019t be ignored. Replacing the electoral college with a national popular vote\u2014paired with strong nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and accessibility, plus automatic recounts in close races\u2014would strengthen trust and reduce the sense that outcomes hinge on a few swing states. If a full replacement isn\u2019t feasible, expanding the House and allocating electors proportionally within each state would be a practical step that preserves federalism while better reflecting the will of the people.",
    "23": "I\u2019d replace the Electoral College with a national popular vote, while keeping a modest state-by-state threshold or ranked-choice voting to ensure winners have broad support and campaigns don\u2019t ignore less-populated areas. The goal should be simple: every vote should count equally, and the rules should be transparent and trusted\u2014like a good care plan that works the same way for everyone. If that\u2019s too big a leap right now, we could at least require states to allocate electors proportionally and set uniform national standards for voting access and certification so close elections don\u2019t spiral into chaos.",
    "8": "I\u2019d like to see the electoral college reformed so every vote carries roughly equal weight, while still respecting that communities across the country have different needs and voices. A national popular vote with clear, consistent standards for counting ballots\u2014alongside safeguards that encourage candidates to engage with smaller and rural areas, not just big media markets\u2014feels like a fairer way to choose a president. If we can agree that legitimacy comes from both broad support and trust in the process, we can build a system that\u2019s simpler, more transparent, and harder to manipulate.",
    "22": "I\u2019m open to reforms that keep the Electoral College\u2019s role in balancing states\u2019 voices while making the process clearer, more consistent, and easier to trust\u2014like uniform rules for voter ID, deadlines, and counting so every ballot is handled the same way. I\u2019d rather improve transparency and reliability than scrap the system entirely, because stability matters and close elections shouldn\u2019t feel like chaos. If there\u2019s room for change, it should be focused on confidence and fairness\u2014strong audits, clear recount standards, and consequences for sloppy administration\u2014so people on both sides can accept the results.",
    "40": "I value an election system people can understand and trust, and I\u2019m open to reform that keeps smaller states from feeling ignored while also making every vote matter more equally. A practical middle path would be a national popular vote with a clear, uniform standard for counting ballots, paired with protections that ensure campaigns still compete in a wide range of states instead of just a few big media markets. If we can agree on transparency, fairness, and broad participation, we can update the rules without turning every election into a zero-sum fight.",
    "7": "I\u2019d replace the Electoral College with a national popular vote paired with ranked-choice voting, so every ballot counts equally and candidates have to earn broader, less divisive support. If people worry about smaller states being ignored, we can build in safeguards through fair districting, uniform voting access, and strong local election administration rather than letting a handful of swing states decide. A system that rewards turnout everywhere and reduces winner-take-all incentives feels like the best way to restore trust and keep the country focused on long-term stewardship over short-term politics.",
    "24": "I respect the idea of balancing the voices of different regions, but I also believe every vote should feel equally valued, so I\u2019d support keeping the Electoral College while requiring states to award their electors by the statewide popular vote with clear, uniform rules and strong protections against fraud. To build trust across parties and communities, we should also expand transparent audits and make it easier to vote legally\u2014like secure early voting and simple ID options\u2014so the results are accepted even when our preferred side loses. This kind of reform keeps the structure that many people rely on while answering the fairness concerns that others raise.",
    "9": "I want every vote to count the same, so I\u2019d replace the Electoral College with a national popular vote, or at least require states to award electors proportionally instead of winner-take-all. I get why people worry about big cities deciding everything, so I\u2019d pair that change with strong voting access everywhere and clear, consistent rules that protect small communities too. At the end of the day, the system should feel fair, simple, and trustworthy\u2014because when you work hard and raise kids, you need to believe your voice matters.",
    "26": "I\u2019d like to see the electoral college reformed so every vote carries the same weight, while still keeping faith with the idea that states shouldn\u2019t be ignored\u2014moving toward a national popular vote with clear, uniform standards and a system like the National Popular Vote compact strikes that balance. A ranked-choice popular vote could also lower the temperature by rewarding broader appeal instead of narrow wins in a handful of places. What matters most is a process people across the spectrum can trust: transparent rules, fair districting, and elections that make voters feel heard whether they live in a big city or a rural county.",
    "37": "I value an election system that feels fair to both big cities and smaller communities, and I\u2019m open to reforms that increase trust without throwing out the balance of our federal system. Instead of eliminating the Electoral College outright, I\u2019d support steps like requiring states to award electors proportionally or by congressional district, paired with stronger, uniform election standards and transparent audits so everyone can accept the results. If we can agree that every vote should matter and every region should have a voice, we can modernize the process without deepening the divide.",
    "30": "I\u2019d support moving toward a national popular vote with strong, transparent standards for ballot access and recounts, because it feels simplest and fairest that every vote should carry the same weight. At the same time, I get the worry about big states dominating, so I\u2019m open to reforms like ranked-choice voting and multi-member congressional districts that broaden representation without giving any one region a veto. If we can agree that trust, security, and legitimacy matter more than party advantage, we can design an election system that\u2019s both harder to game and easier to accept\u2014even when our side loses.",
    "49": "I\u2019m into systems that feel fair and transparent, and the Electoral College doesn\u2019t land that way when a few swing states can outweigh millions of other votes. I\u2019d replace it with a national popular vote, or at least require states to award electors proportionally with ranked-choice voting so every ballot matters and campaigning isn\u2019t just a flyover of most communities. At the same time, I get why people worry about big-city dominance, so I\u2019d pair reform with strong local control and voting access everywhere\u2014so representation feels real whether you\u2019re in a small town or a major metro.",
    "2": "I\u2019d support moving toward a national popular vote, but only with clear, uniform election standards and a process that keeps local voices from being drowned out by a handful of media markets. If that\u2019s a bridge too far right now, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors in every state could be practical steps that still respect federalism while making outcomes feel fairer. Whatever the path, the goal should be simple: every vote should carry roughly the same weight, and the rules should be transparent enough that people across the political spectrum can trust the result.",
    "6": "I\u2019m open to improving the Electoral College, but I don\u2019t want reforms that leave rural and smaller communities feeling erased or elections feeling like they\u2019re run entirely by a few big cities. A good middle path would be clearer, uniform election rules across states, stronger safeguards for ballot integrity, and updating how electors are allocated\u2014such as proportional awards in each state\u2014so every vote matters more without tearing up the federal balance. If we can agree that every eligible voter should trust the process and feel their voice counts, we can modernize the system without turning every close race into a nationwide recount fight.",
    "27": "I\u2019d like to see the Electoral College reformed so every vote feels equally meaningful, but in a way that still reassures people in smaller states that they won\u2019t be ignored. A national popular vote with clear, uniform rules for counting and access\u2014plus safeguards like ranked-choice voting and strong audits\u2014could make outcomes feel fairer and reduce the \u201call-or-nothing\u201d pressure that fuels distrust. If full replacement isn\u2019t realistic right now, expanding the proportional allocation of electors and supporting the National Popular Vote compact seems like a practical step that respects both majority rule and broad regional support.",
    "43": "I\u2019m open to reforming the Electoral College so the presidency better reflects the will of voters while still giving smaller states confidence they won\u2019t be ignored. A practical bridge is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact paired with uniform, transparent election standards and a commitment to broad access, so every ballot is counted the same and campaigns have incentives to compete everywhere. I can respect the desire for stability and local voice, but the current winner-take-all approach in most states distorts outcomes and leaves too many people feeling like their vote doesn\u2019t matter.",
    "31": "I\u2019m open to modernizing how we choose presidents, but I want any reform to keep faith with the idea that smaller and rural states shouldn\u2019t be drowned out by a handful of big metros. A practical compromise could be requiring states to award electoral votes proportionally (or by congressional district with strong anti\u2011gerrymandering rules) while setting a clear national baseline\u2014like an automatic recount standard and uniform ballot access\u2014so every voter feels the process is fair. If we can tighten election administration and transparency without turning the system into a pure nationwide popularity contest, I think we can reduce distrust and still protect broad geographic representation.",
    "46": "I\u2019m open to modifying the Electoral College in ways that keep states meaningfully engaged while better matching outcomes to the popular will\u2014such as requiring states to allocate electors proportionally or through a national compact that activates once enough states join. The goal, in my view, is to reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions and make every vote carry similar weight without turning presidential elections into a pure big-city vs. rural contest. If we treat this like a systems problem\u2014testable, measurable, and focused on fairness\u2014we can agree on reforms that increase legitimacy and trust even among people who start from different intuitions about federalism.",
    "36": "I\u2019m open to keeping the Electoral College, but I\u2019d modernize it so every vote carries more equal weight\u2014something like awarding electors by congressional district or proportional to the statewide vote, and requiring states to use independent commissions to draw fair districts. At the same time, I\u2019d support clearer national standards for ballot access, counting, and audits so people on both sides can trust the results. If we can protect the voice of smaller states while making outcomes feel less arbitrary, we might finally stop treating every election like a riddle with a punchline nobody likes.",
    "19": "I\u2019d like to see the Electoral College reformed so every vote carries the same weight, whether you live in a big city or a rural town, because people should feel like showing up and being counted actually matters. A good bridge could be a national popular vote with strong, clear standards for election security and access, or at least expanding the House and awarding electors proportionally so a few swing states don\u2019t dominate everything. If the goal is trust and stability, we should protect local control where it works while making the outcome match the will of the voters.",
    "48": "I\u2019d like to see the Electoral College replaced with a straightforward national popular vote, because every ballot should carry the same weight no matter where someone lives. At the same time, I understand the worry about big cities dominating, so I\u2019m open to reforms that keep broad, nationwide appeal\u2014like ranked-choice voting and uniform standards for fair access and secure counting in every state. Whatever the model, the goal should be a system people can trust and explain to their neighbors without feeling like the rules are tilted.",
    "12": "I value rules that are clear, stable, and trusted, so I\u2019m cautious about scrapping the Electoral College outright, but I do think it can be improved to better reflect the will of voters. Expanding the use of proportional allocation of electors within states and setting consistent national standards for ballot access, recounts, and election integrity could reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions without erasing the role of states. If we focus on transparency, fairness, and public confidence\u2014rather than scoring partisan wins\u2014we can protect both majority rule and the voices of smaller communities.",
    "13": "I value the idea that states and local communities should matter in presidential elections, but I also understand the frustration when the national popular vote and the outcome don\u2019t line up. Rather than scrap the Electoral College outright, I\u2019d support reforms like awarding electors by congressional district with clear, uniform rules and stronger safeguards for ballot access and integrity across states. If we can agree the goal is both legitimacy and broad national support, we should tighten the system so every vote feels meaningful without turning elections into a handful of big-city media markets.",
    "39": "I\u2019d like to see the Electoral College reformed so every vote carries roughly the same weight, while still respecting that smaller states don\u2019t want to be ignored\u2014something like a national popular vote with ranked-choice ballots, or allocating electors proportionally instead of winner-take-all. In my work, small design tweaks can make a product both stronger and fairer without throwing out what people are used to, and that\u2019s how I think we should approach elections. If we focus on making outcomes feel legitimate to both big-city and rural voters\u2014through clearer rules, fewer \u201cswing state\u201d distortions, and a broader incentive to campaign everywhere\u2014we can lower the temperature and rebuild trust.",
    "32": "I\u2019m wary of scrapping the Electoral College outright, because stability and clear rules matter, and I don\u2019t want elections decided only by the biggest cities while smaller communities get ignored. At the same time, I can understand the frustration when the popular vote winner loses, so I\u2019d support practical reforms like requiring states to award electoral votes by congressional district (with safeguards against gerrymandering) or increasing transparency and uniform standards for counting ballots. If we focus on making every vote count more fairly while keeping a system that forces candidates to compete across the whole country, I think there\u2019s room for a compromise most people can live with.",
    "44": "I\u2019m open to replacing the Electoral College with a national popular vote, but only alongside clear, uniform election standards and transparent auditing so people can trust the outcome no matter which state they live in. If a full replacement isn\u2019t achievable, reforms like allocating electors proportionally and eliminating winner-take-all rules would better reflect voters while preserving the federal structure many value. Whatever path we take should make every vote matter and reduce incentives to focus on a handful of swing states.",
    "33": "I want a system where every vote feels equally valued, but I also understand why people worry about small communities being ignored; a good path forward could be a national popular vote paired with reforms that strengthen local access and turnout everywhere. Like in the novels I love, the story works best when every voice matters\u2014so I\u2019d support changes such as ranked-choice voting and uniform, fair election rules to build trust across states. If we keep any state-based role, it should be designed to reward broad support and reduce winner-take-all distortions, so the final result reflects both the people and the whole country\u2019s diverse places.",
    "3": "I respect the idea that states and smaller communities shouldn\u2019t get steamrolled, but the current Electoral College too often makes folks feel like their vote doesn\u2019t count, and that\u2019s a hard pill to swallow. I\u2019d keep state-run elections while moving to a national popular vote with ranked-choice ballots, plus clear, uniform standards for access and recounts so every vote is tallied the same\u2014fair and square. If that\u2019s a bridge too far, then at least require states to allocate electors proportionally so the winner-take-all setup doesn\u2019t keep picking winners by inches and calling it miles.",
    "28": "I\u2019d like to see the Electoral College reformed so every vote carries more equal weight, such as adopting a national popular vote or a proportional allocation of electors with ranked-choice voting as a backup, while still encouraging candidates to engage with communities beyond the biggest cities. In the classroom I\u2019ve learned that fair rules and clear incentives shape participation, so I support changes that reward broad coalitions, reduce \u201csafe state\u201d complacency, and make outcomes easier to explain to students and families. If we can agree that legitimacy matters, we can modernize the system in a way that protects stability, strengthens turnout, and helps everyone feel their voice counts.",
    "20": "I\u2019d replace the electoral college with a national popular vote, but I\u2019d pair that change with practical safeguards\u2014automatic voter registration, strong election security standards, and an expanded right to vote by mail\u2014so everyone trusts the outcome. I understand why some worry that smaller states or rural communities could be overlooked, so I\u2019d support reforms like independent redistricting and more equitable representation in Congress to ensure every community has real leverage. After a lifetime of helping people navigate systems that feel rigged or distant, I think the simplest principle is best: every vote should carry the same weight, and the rules should be clear, fair, and secure.",
    "17": "I\u2019d like to see the Electoral College reformed so the winner reflects the national popular vote while still making sure every state feels heard\u2014things like a national popular vote compact or a proportional allocation of electors seem like practical steps. In my work managing a busy restaurant, the system runs best when every person\u2019s effort counts and the rules are clear, so I\u2019m drawn to a process that\u2019s straightforward and fair. At the same time, I understand the worry about big cities dominating, which is why I\u2019m open to pairing reform with measures that keep candidates engaged across rural, suburban, and urban communities.",
    "18": "I value a system where every vote carries the same weight, so I\u2019d favor moving toward a national popular vote\u2014either by reforming the Electoral College to allocate electors proportionally or by adopting a workable interstate agreement\u2014while keeping clear safeguards for close counts and recounts. At the same time, I understand the worry that smaller or rural communities could be ignored, so I\u2019d pair any change with practical steps like fair districting, accessible voting, and strong local election funding to make sure turnout and trust rise everywhere. The goal isn\u2019t to tilt the field for one side, but to make the outcome feel legitimate, transparent, and worth accepting even when your candidate loses.",
    "34": "I value an election system that treats every vote as equal while still giving people in smaller or rural communities confidence that they won\u2019t be ignored, so I\u2019m open to reforms that move us closer to a national popular vote without sidelining local voices. A practical step would be the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact paired with stronger, uniform election standards and a commitment to protect access and trust in the count. If we keep any state-based role, I\u2019d favor proportional allocation of electors rather than winner-take-all, so outcomes feel fairer and less divisive.",
    "42": "I get why people value the Electoral College for keeping states relevant, but it\u2019s hard to defend a system where the national popular vote winner can still lose\u2014fairness and trust matter if we want people to accept the result. I\u2019d support keeping the state-based structure while adopting a fix like allocating electors by congressional district or using a proportional split with a national popular-vote backstop, so every vote counts without turning elections into a few big-city markets. The goal should be clearer rules, fewer \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions, and outcomes that most folks\u2014no matter where they live\u2014can see as legitimate.",
    "52": "I\u2019d like to see the electoral college modernized so every vote feels like it matters equally, while still respecting that different regions have different needs and priorities. A good middle ground could be the National Popular Vote compact or allocating electors proportionally by state, paired with clear national standards for voting access and security. That way we keep the incentive to pay attention to the whole country, but reduce the feeling that a handful of swing states decide everything.",
    "56": "I understand why some people value the Electoral College for giving smaller states a stronger voice, but it\u2019s hard to defend a system where the candidate with fewer votes can still win. I\u2019d support a reform that keeps the state-by-state structure while requiring electors to follow the national popular vote, so every ballot carries equal weight without rewriting everything overnight. Whatever we choose should be simple, transparent, and trustworthy\u2014because confidence in the outcome matters as much as the outcome itself.",
    "60": "I\u2019d replace the Electoral College with a national popular vote, or at least award electors proportionally, because every vote should count the same no matter where someone lives. At the same time, I get why people worry about smaller states being ignored, so I\u2019d pair reform with measures that force candidates to compete everywhere\u2014like proportional allocation and stronger voting access so turnout and trust go up. The goal isn\u2019t to help one side win; it\u2019s to make the system feel fair, clear, and worth showing up for.",
    "70": "I understand why people want every vote to feel equal, but I also value a system that keeps smaller states from being ignored and encourages candidates to build broad support. Rather than scrap the Electoral College, I\u2019d support reforms that reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d outcomes\u2014like allocating electors by district or proportionally\u2014and strengthen election integrity and transparency across all states. If we can agree that both fairness and national unity matter, we can modernize the system without breaking the balance it was designed to protect.",
    "65": "I understand why people want every vote to count equally, but I also worry about big, high-turnout areas drowning out the concerns of smaller states and more rural communities. I\u2019d keep the basic structure while making it fairer\u2014require states to award electoral votes proportionally or by congressional district, and set consistent national standards for ballots and recounts so close elections don\u2019t turn into chaos. That kind of reform respects the country\u2019s federal design while making outcomes feel more legitimate to people on both sides.",
    "72": "I want a system where every vote feels like it counts the same, while still respecting that communities of all sizes deserve to be heard. Moving to a national popular vote with clear, uniform rules and automatic recount standards would build trust, and pairing it with nonpartisan redistricting and stronger election access would help people accept the results even when their side loses. If we keep any state-based role, it should be tied to fair representation and transparency\u2014not winner-take-all incentives that make most places feel ignored.",
    "67": "I want a system where every vote counts the same, so I\u2019d move toward a national popular vote with clear, transparent standards for counting and recounts that everyone can trust.

If we keep parts of the current setup, I\u2019d still want reforms like allocating electoral votes by district or proportionally, so every community\u2014not just a few swing areas\u2014gets real attention.",
    "798": "I\u2019d like to see the Electoral College reformed so every vote carries roughly the same weight while still giving states a meaningful role in the process. A practical bridge could be adopting a national popular vote through a state compact, or at minimum requiring proportional allocation of electors and ending winner-take-all rules that leave many voters feeling ignored. I\u2019m open to keeping the basic structure if we pair it with clear, transparent standards for recounts and certification so the outcome is trusted, even when it\u2019s close.",
    "784": "I\u2019ve come to respect the Electoral College as a product of its time, but I also think it now too often leaves voters feeling unheard and pushes campaigns to ignore most of the country. A sensible bridge is to keep state-based administration while adopting a national popular vote through an interstate compact, or at least require proportional allocation of electors so every vote matters, not just those in a handful of swing states. If we pair that with clear, uniform standards for ballot access and recounts, we can protect federalism and stability while better honoring the principle that the candidate with the most support should win.",
    "786": "The Electoral College has outlived much of its original rationale and too often creates outcomes that diverge from the principle of political equality, so I favor moving toward a national popular vote while preserving federalism through clear, uniform election standards. A pragmatic bridge is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact coupled with ranked-choice voting and stronger protections for local election administration, which can reduce zero-sum incentives and broaden legitimate consent. I understand the concern that smaller states could be ignored, but that\u2019s better addressed through fair districting, robust rural investment, and structural checks in Congress than by a presidential selection mechanism that can discount millions of ballots.",
    "799": "I\u2019m open to improving the Electoral College, but I don\u2019t want changes that make people in smaller or rural states feel like their voices don\u2019t count compared to big-city voters. A sensible middle ground is to keep it while requiring every elector to follow the state\u2019s popular vote, awarding electors by congressional district with a small statewide bonus, and setting clear national standards for ballots and recounts. That way the winner still has to build a broad coalition, and everyone can have more confidence the rules are fair and consistent.",
    "801": "I\u2019d like to see the Electoral College reformed so every vote carries roughly equal weight, while still preserving incentives for candidates to pay attention to smaller and rural communities. A practical step is a national popular vote with a ranked-choice ballot and strong, uniform election standards so people trust the outcome even when their preferred candidate doesn\u2019t win. If that\u2019s too big a lift, expanding the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact and requiring proportional allocation of electors would be a fairer, calmer transition that respects the country\u2019s federal structure.",

The goal shouldn\u2019t be \u201cmy side wins,\u201d but a system that feels fair, transparent, and worthy of the students we\u2019re teaching about democracy.",
    "789": "I\u2019m open to keeping the Electoral College, but I think it needs some practical repairs so people can trust the outcome\u2014clear, uniform rules for counting ballots and a requirement that electors follow their state\u2019s popular vote would be a good start. If we\u2019re going to change it more than that, I could live with a national popular vote only if it comes with safeguards that prevent a few big metro areas from dominating and ensures every lawful ballot is handled the same way. We may disagree on the destination, but we can agree that elections should be simple, transparent, and fair\u2014no funny business, and no surprises after the fact.",
    "800": "I respect the Electoral College for keeping smaller states engaged, but I also think the system needs clearer fairness and transparency so people trust that every lawful vote is counted the same way. A good bridge is to keep the state-based framework while encouraging reforms like more uniform election standards and awarding electors by congressional district or through a proportional approach, rather than winner-take-all. If we can agree on secure elections, clear rules, and outcomes that feel legitimate to both rural and urban communities, we can strengthen the republic without tearing up the whole structure.",
    "797": "I want an election system that feels fair to voters everywhere and still respects the different needs of states and communities, so I\u2019m open to keeping the Electoral College but reforming it with clearer, uniform rules and more transparency. Expanding the use of proportional allocation within states (instead of winner-take-all) and setting consistent standards for voting and recounts could help every vote feel like it matters without turning elections into a handful of big-city battlegrounds. Even people who disagree on the best end goal can agree that predictable rules, public trust, and accurate results should come first.",
    "793": "I get why people want every vote to carry the same weight, but scrapping the Electoral College outright feels like tearing out a load\u2011bearing wall instead of fixing what\u2019s cracked. A better approach is to keep the state-based structure while tightening the workmanship: require states to award electors by congressional district with a statewide bonus for the winner, and set clear national standards for ballot access and vote counting so trust in the results is solid. That keeps smaller states from getting steamrolled, while making outcomes track the popular will more closely and reducing the \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions.",
    "794": "I\u2019d keep the idea that every community should matter in presidential elections, but I\u2019d modify the system so the winner reflects the national popular vote while still encouraging candidates to campaign beyond a few swing states\u2014something like the National Popular Vote compact paired with clear, uniform election standards. Whatever reform we choose should prioritize trust and transparency: independent redistricting, consistent voting access, and post\u2011election audits that are routine and nonpartisan. That approach respects people who worry about big states dominating while also addressing the frustration many feel when the overall vote and the outcome don\u2019t match.",

A practical middle ground is to require states to award electors by congressional district with one statewide \u201cat-large\u201d elector, along with stronger, uniform election standards and a clear process for recounts. That would respect local voices while making outcomes track more closely with how people actually vote.",
    "787": "I want presidential elections to feel fair to voters everywhere, but I also don\u2019t want the biggest cities to drown out smaller communities that live with different challenges. A good compromise is to keep the electoral college while requiring states to award electors by congressional district with a couple at-large, and adding basic national standards like voter ID with free, easy access and cleaner voter rolls. If a candidate wins the most votes nationwide but loses because of razor-thin margins in a few states, I\u2019m open to a uniform recount trigger and clearer rules so people can trust the outcome even when their side loses.",

If we keep any state-based role, I\u2019d favor allocating electors proportionally instead of winner-take-all, because it rewards turnout everywhere and lowers the temperature after close elections.",
    "791": "I\u2019d like to see the Electoral College replaced with a national popular vote, because every ballot should carry the same weight and it\u2019s hard to explain why some voices count more just because of where they live.

I\u2019d keep the electoral college but modernize it by requiring states to award electors by congressional district with an extra two going to the statewide winner, and by setting basic national standards for fair voting and recounts. That way the outcome still reflects the whole country, and both sides can trust the process a little more.",
    "805": "I get why people want every vote to count the same, but I also get the worry that big population centers could drown out smaller states, so I\u2019d keep the state-by-state structure while tightening the fairness. A practical middle ground is a national popular vote that kicks in only once enough states agree, paired with proportional allocation of electors (not winner-take-all) so close races don\u2019t turn into all-or-nothing outcomes. Whatever we do, it should be simple, transparent, and hard to game\u2014because when rules feel rigged, trust breaks down fast and it\u2019s tough to rebuild.",
