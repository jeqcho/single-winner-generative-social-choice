    "89": "I want a presidential election where every vote carries the same weight and campaigns have a reason to show up everywhere\u2014not just in a few swing states or the biggest media markets. The best bridge I see is moving toward the national popular vote through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. If that transition takes time, requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state and expanding ranked-choice voting would reduce winner-take-all distortions while keeping the process stable and easier to trust.",
    "544": "I\u2019m open to reforming the Electoral College, but I\u2019m not convinced we should scrap it in a way that leaves large metro areas as the only places campaigns compete and listen. A workable middle ground is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, paired with clear nationwide standards for voter eligibility checks, ballot handling, audits, and recounts so close outcomes are trusted. That approach makes more votes matter in every state, reduces the swing-state distortion, and still preserves the idea that a president should earn broad geographic support.",
    "96": "I\u2019m not itching to throw out the Electoral College, because I do think it pushes candidates to pay attention to more than just a few big metro areas, but the winner-take-all setup leaves too many folks feeling like their vote doesn\u2019t matter. A commonsense fix is to keep the state-based framework while requiring proportional (or district-based) elector allocation, paired with clear, nationwide standards for secure voting, transparent audits, and automatic recounts in razor-thin races. That way we honor regional balance and local administration while making the outcome track the people\u2019s will more closely\u2014fair is fair.",
    "308": "I want a presidential election outcome that\u2019s easy to explain, feels fair to families in every kind of community, and doesn\u2019t make most of the country feel like spectators while a few swing areas decide everything. A workable bridge is to keep states administering elections but move away from winner-take-all\u2014either through proportional electoral votes or the popular-vote compact\u2014paired with clear national standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. If we also adopt ranked-choice voting, winners would need broader support, and it would be harder for the process to feel like a zero-sum fight over technicalities.",
    "38": "I\u2019ve always trusted steady rules that don\u2019t change just to help one side, and I want an election result that people can accept as fair even when they\u2019re disappointed. I don\u2019t think we should throw out the Electoral College, but we should reduce the winner\u2011take\u2011all problem by requiring states to award electors proportionally (or by district) and set clear, nationwide standards for counting, audits, and automatic recounts in very close races. That keeps smaller places from being ignored while making it harder for a few swing areas to outweigh everyone else.",
    "408": "I\u2019m not interested in scrapping the Electoral College if it means campaigns only chase a few big media markets, but the current winner-take-all setup also makes too many voters feel like their vote doesn\u2019t matter and turns a handful of swing places into the whole election. A workable middle ground is keeping the state-based framework while requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, paired with clear nationwide standards for secure voting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. That would push candidates to compete more broadly, make outcomes feel more legitimate, and improve trust without rewriting the whole system overnight.",
    "267": "I\u2019m not interested in tearing down the Electoral College just to score points, but I do think it needs tightening so the outcome feels fair and every voter has reason to show up, even in \u201csafe\u201d states. A good compromise is to keep the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional or district-based electors, and pairing that with clear, nationwide standards for secure voting, transparent audits, and automatic recount rules. That keeps smaller places from being brushed aside while making it harder for a few swing counties to speak for the whole country.",
    "608": "I\u2019m not interested in blowing up the Electoral College just to score points, but it\u2019s hard to defend a setup where most states feel ignored and a few battlegrounds get all the attention. The best compromise to me is keeping the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all\u2014using proportional or district-based allocation\u2014paired with clear, nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts so the rules are consistent and results are trusted. That way campaigns have to earn support across the whole country, and voters in every state can feel like their vote actually matters.",
    "127": "I\u2019ve come to believe the healthiest reforms are the ones that make the outcome match voters more closely without telling smaller communities they don\u2019t matter, because trust erodes fast when people feel \u201ccounted out.\u201d I\u2019d keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by moving to proportional electoral votes or the National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear national standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in razor-thin races. If we also use ranked-choice voting, candidates have to earn broader support instead of living off a few swing counties, and we can get back to arguing about policy instead of the scoreboard.",
    "239": "I want a presidential election where the winner matches the will of the voters, but I also don\u2019t want campaigns to become a nonstop chase of only the biggest media markets while entire regions get written off. The most workable bridge to me is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional electoral votes (and exploring the National Popular Vote compact), paired with clear national standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in razor-thin races. That would make more votes matter in more places, lower the temperature around close outcomes, and still keep states meaningfully involved in the process.",
    "725": "I\u2019m not looking to blow up the Electoral College, but I do think we should tighten it up so the winner-take-all distortion doesn\u2019t turn most states into spectators and leave people doubting the outcome. A solid compromise is proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with clear national standards for ballot security, audits, and automatic recounts so every vote is handled the same and the process stays squared away. That keeps the federal balance and makes candidates compete beyond a few swing ZIP codes, while making the result track voter intent more closely.",
    "106": "I\u2019m not convinced we should scrap the Electoral College, because I don\u2019t want presidential campaigns to focus only on a few major media markets and forget quieter places, but I also understand the frustration when the outcome doesn\u2019t line up with the vote and too many people feel written off. A sensible compromise is to keep the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all through proportional or district allocation, and to set clear, uniform national standards for secure voting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. If we aim for simple rules that treat voters consistently and reward broad, cross-regional support, more Americans can trust the result even when their candidate loses.",
    "614": "I want a presidential election where every vote feels like it counts the same, because it\u2019s hard to stay engaged\u2014and teach kids that participation matters\u2014when the outcome can hinge on a few swing states. At the same time, I don\u2019t want rural and smaller communities written off, so I\u2019d support a practical step like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear national standards for voting access, audits, and recounts. The common thread is legitimacy: whichever model we choose should be simple, transparent, and push candidates to build broad, cross\u2011regional support instead of gaming the map.",
    "663": "I can respect why the Electoral College exists\u2014to make sure candidates don\u2019t only chase the biggest cities\u2014while also seeing how winner-take-all rules leave too many families feeling like their votes don\u2019t matter unless they live in a swing state. A workable compromise is to keep the state-based framework but require proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, with clear nationwide standards for secure voting, audits, and automatic recounts in very close races. That would push candidates to build broader, cross\u2011regional support and give people more confidence in the outcome, even when it doesn\u2019t go their way.",
    "796": "I\u2019m not for blowing up the Electoral College, but I do think it ought to feel fairer so regular folks don\u2019t feel like their vote disappears just because they live in a \u201csafe\u201d state. A middle-ground I can get behind is keeping the state-based setup while ending winner-take-all\u2014split electors proportionally or by district\u2014and pairing that with clear, nationwide standards for ID options, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. That way big cities don\u2019t call all the shots, smaller communities still matter, and the rules are simple enough that most people can trust the outcome and get on with life.",
    "801": "I\u2019m increasingly convinced the winner should align with the national popular vote, but I also take seriously the fear that a few dense metro areas\u2014or, under the current rules, a few swing states\u2014end up dominating while everyone else gets ignored. The most workable bridge to me is to keep state-run elections yet end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through the National Popular Vote compact), paired with clear national standards for voting access, audits, and automatic recounts in razor-thin races. That combination would make outcomes feel fairer and easier to accept, while pushing campaigns to compete for support in more places rather than writing off whole regions.",
    "729": "I want a presidential election that feels simple and fair\u2014where every vote matters even if you live in a \u201csafe\u201d state\u2014while still respecting that people worry about smaller and rural communities getting ignored. The most workable bridge to me is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional electoral votes (or a popular-vote compact) and pairing that with clear national standards for ballot access, auditing, and automatic recounts in very close races. If we design reforms around transparency and broad participation instead of partisan advantage, it\u2019s easier for more people to trust the outcome and move forward together.",
    "500": "I want a presidential election outcome that\u2019s easy to explain to my kids and feels fair no matter what state you live in, because when the rules look like a loophole people stop trusting the result. The best bridge I see is moving away from winner-take-all\u2014either through proportional electors or the National Popular Vote compact\u2014paired with clear national standards for voting access, audits, and automatic recounts in very close races. That keeps states meaningfully involved while making every vote matter more and reducing the swing-state obsession that leaves too many communities ignored.",
    "462": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make the winner line up with the voters more directly, because it\u2019s hard to defend a system where your vote matters a lot in a few states and barely at all in others. At the same time, I don\u2019t want presidential campaigns to become even more obsessed with a handful of giant media markets, so I\u2019d favor a practical path like the National Popular Vote compact or proportional elector allocation, paired with clear nationwide standards for voting access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. That feels like a fair middle ground: every vote counts more equally, and every community still has a reason to be listened to.",
    "591": "I\u2019m not interested in tearing down the Electoral College, but I do think it should be adjusted so fewer people feel written off and so the result more consistently matches how the country actually voted. A sensible middle path is to keep the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all\u2014using proportional or district-based electors\u2014and pairing that with clear, uniform standards for ballot security, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. That way candidates still have to pay attention to smaller communities, but every vote matters more and the outcome is easier for everyone to trust.",
    "348": "I\u2019m not looking to blow up the Electoral College, because I do think it pushes candidates to build support across different regions, not just the biggest population centers, but it also shouldn\u2019t feel like most votes are \u201cwasted\u201d outside a few battlegrounds. A workable compromise is to keep the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, paired with clear national standards for secure voting, audits, and automatic recounts in razor-thin races. That would make outcomes track the voters more closely, reduce the incentive to game the map, and give people in every state more reason to believe their ballot truly matters.",
    "174": "I want a presidential election where every vote feels like it counts the same, because when the rules feel lopsided it\u2019s hard for people to accept the outcome and move on. At the same time, I get the concern that a pure winner-take-all popular vote could leave whole regions feeling written off, so I\u2019m drawn to practical steps like ending winner-take-all electors, expanding the National Popular Vote compact, and pairing any change with clear national standards for access, audits, and recounts. If we design reforms that are simple, transparent, and reward candidates for building broad, cross-regional coalitions, we can strengthen legitimacy without making any community feel invisible.",
    "58": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and where every voter feels their ballot matters, not just those in a handful of swing states. At the same time, I don\u2019t want campaigns to become a pure big\u2011city numbers chase, so the best path looks like ending winner\u2011take\u2011all through proportional allocation (or a popular\u2011vote compact as a bridge), paired with clear nationwide standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. If reforms push candidates to earn broad, cross\u2011regional support while making outcomes track the people\u2019s vote more closely, I think more of us could accept results and move forward together.",
    "766": "I want a presidential election where the winner clearly reflects the voters, and where it doesn\u2019t feel like your voice depends on living in a \u201cswing\u201d place while most of the country gets ignored. The best bridge to me is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote compact, paired with simple nationwide standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts so close results are trusted. That respects the role states play and the worry about big metros dominating, while still making every ballot matter more evenly and pushing candidates to compete in more communities.",
    "514": "I\u2019m not looking to blow up the Electoral College, because I do think the country works best when candidates have to listen beyond a few big metro areas, but it\u2019s hard to defend a winner\u2011take\u2011all setup that makes so many votes feel pointless and turns everything into a handful of battlegrounds. A sensible reform is to keep the state framework while requiring proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with clear, consistent national standards for secure voting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. That would make results line up better with what voters actually chose while keeping every region in the conversation and lowering the temperature when elections are tight.",
    "598": "I want a presidential election where the winner matches the will of the voters and the rules are clear enough that people can accept the result even when they\u2019re disappointed. The best bridge I see is moving toward the national popular vote\u2014through the National Popular Vote compact or by ending winner-take-all with proportional electors\u2014paired with uniform, transparent standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. That keeps states meaningfully involved while making every vote matter in every place, so campaigns have reason to listen beyond a few swing counties.",
    "141": "When you spend your days around machines, you learn that a system people rely on has to be consistent, easy to explain, and deliver the result it\u2019s supposed to deliver\u2014so it bothers me when the presidency can hinge on a few swing places or when the popular vote and outcome don\u2019t line up. I can respect the idea of keeping every region relevant, but we should at least end winner-take-all by moving to proportional electoral votes or the National Popular Vote compact so every ballot matters in every state. Whatever route we take, it needs clear nationwide standards for access, counting, audits, and recounts so working families can trust the process and get back to life.",
    "570": "I\u2019m increasingly convinced we should move toward a result that matches the national popular vote, because legitimacy is hard to defend when a voter\u2019s influence depends on geography, but I also take seriously the fear that campaigns will write off smaller communities if the rules change overnight. A practical bridge is to curb winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through the National Popular Vote compact) and pair that with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, auditing, and automatic recounts in close races. If the system is simple, transparent, and rewards broad coalitions rather than a few battleground counties, it becomes easier for people to accept outcomes even when their side loses.",
    "428": "I want the president to be chosen in a way that\u2019s easy to explain, feels fair to every voter, and doesn\u2019t let a handful of swing states or technicalities outweigh the country\u2019s overall choice. For me, the best bridge is to keep states administering elections but move away from winner-take-all\u2014either through a national popular-vote compact or required proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. That would make more votes matter in every state while still answering the worry that whole regions could be ignored.",
    "420": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain and feels fair, where people don\u2019t feel written off just because they live in the \u201cwrong\u201d state, but I also understand the desire to keep candidates from focusing only on a few big population centers. A practical bridge is to move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally nationwide and pairing that with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. Over time, I\u2019m open to a national popular-vote approach\u2014like a workable compact\u2014so every vote matters equally while the system stays transparent and stable enough for the country to accept the outcome and move on.",
    "745": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every voter feel like their ballot matters, not just the ones in a handful of swing states. The clearest direction is to align the outcome with the national popular vote\u2014whether through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or a uniform proportional approach\u2014paired with consistent national standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in razor-thin races. That combination respects the state role in running elections while reducing winner-take-all distortions and giving rural, suburban, and urban communities equal reason to expect candidates to show up and listen.",
    "257": "I don\u2019t want to scrap the Electoral College and end up with candidates focused only on the biggest media markets, but I also can\u2019t ignore how winner-take-all rules make a lot of votes feel pointless and push everything into a few battleground counties. A workable middle ground is to keep the state-based framework while requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors and setting clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close results are trusted. That would make campaigns compete in more places, reduce the sense that the map matters more than voters, and give people a fairer outcome without tearing up the whole system.",
    "350": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain to my kids and my team at work: every vote should matter, and the rules should feel the same no matter what state you\u2019re in. I\u2019m open to moving toward the national popular vote through a practical step like the National Popular Vote compact, and in the meantime we should end winner\u2011take\u2011all by awarding electors proportionally so \u201csafe states\u201d don\u2019t get written off. To address the worry about big cities drowning out smaller communities, I\u2019d pair any change with ranked\u2011choice voting and clear nationwide standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. If we focus on fairness, transparency, and broad participation instead of partisan advantage, we can modernize the system without making any region feel ignored.",
    "148": "I want a presidential election that feels straightforward and fair, where every ballot matters and the rules are consistent enough that people can trust the count and get back to their lives. At the same time, I don\u2019t want candidates to write off smaller communities, so I\u2019d start by ending winner-take-all through proportional electors (or a district-based split with strong anti-gerrymandering rules) and set clear national standards for access, audits, and recounts. If that builds confidence, moving toward a national popular vote through an interstate compact\u2014with a majority requirement like ranked-choice\u2014seems like a practical next step that rewards broad support across the whole country.",
    "79": "Working on construction projects has taught me that people trust the outcome when the rules are clear, consistent, and everyone can see how the final result was reached. I want a presidential election where every vote matters no matter the ZIP code, so I\u2019d move toward a national popular-vote outcome\u2014through the National Popular Vote compact or proportional elector allocation\u2014paired with uniform standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. At the same time, I take seriously the worry about smaller and rural communities being ignored, which is why I support changes like ranked-choice voting and ending winner-take-all incentives that push campaigns to chase only a few battlegrounds. The goal is a system that\u2019s simple to explain, hard to game, and legitimate enough that people can accept the result and get back to solving everyday problems.",
    "41": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and trustworthy enough that people can accept the outcome even when it\u2019s not the one they wanted.

That feels like a practical way to honor the principle that every vote should matter and the reality that communities don\u2019t want to be written off just because they\u2019re smaller or not in a battleground.",
    "744": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College, because I want presidents to have to earn support beyond a few big population centers, but I also don\u2019t think our elections should hinge on a handful of swing counties or leave millions feeling like their vote didn\u2019t matter.

The most workable bridge to me is moving toward a national popular-vote outcome (through the interstate compact or proportional elector allocation) paired with ranked-choice voting so winners earn broader support.

The best common-ground fix is to keep the state-run framework but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional elector allocation (or a district-plus-at-large split with strong anti\u2011gerrymandering rules) and pair it with uniform national standards for access, audits, and automatic recounts. That would reduce the swing-state lottery without making smaller communities feel erased, and it would push candidates to earn broad support instead of narrowly optimizing the map.",

I\u2019m inclined to move toward a national popular vote, ideally through a practical bridge like the National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, and recounts so trust doesn\u2019t depend on where you live, capisce?

If we\u2019re ready to go further, the National Popular Vote compact\u2014ideally with ranked-choice to ensure a real majority\u2014gets us closer to one person, one vote without blowing up the whole process overnight.",

The most workable bridge is moving toward the national popular vote\u2014ideally through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts so every state can trust the process. If that\u2019s not politically reachable yet, ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors would still make campaigns compete beyond a few swing states while easing fears that any single region can dominate.",
    "581": "I\u2019m not convinced we should abolish the Electoral College outright, because it still matters that candidates build support across very different regions instead of just running up margins in a few major metros.

    "706": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every vote feel like it counts, without turning the whole campaign into a chase for a few swing counties or only the biggest media markets. A realistic bridge is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional elector allocation nationwide, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts in razor-thin races. If we\u2019re ready for the next step after that, a national popular vote\u2014ideally with ranked-choice\u2014would better match the outcome to the will of the country while still rewarding candidates who build broad, cross-regional coalitions.",
    "631": "I want a presidential election where my vote feels like it counts the same as anyone else\u2019s and the rules are simple enough to explain at the kitchen table, not a system that turns a few swing counties into the whole story. At the same time, I understand the fear that a pure winner\u2011take\u2011all mindset\u2014whether by big metros or by battleground states\u2014leaves smaller communities feeling unseen. To bridge that, I\u2019d move toward a national popular vote through a practical step like the National Popular Vote compact, paired with ranked-choice voting and clear nationwide standards for access, counting, and automatic recounts, so the winner has broad support and the process stays trusted. In the end, \u516c\u5e73\u6700\u91cd\u8981: fewer distortions, more transparency, and incentives for candidates to show up everywhere."
