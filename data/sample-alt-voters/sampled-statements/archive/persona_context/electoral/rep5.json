    "243": "I want a presidential election that people can explain in plain language and trust, where every vote feels like it matters and no one is written off because they live in a \u201csafe\u201d state. The simplest bridge, to me, is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional electoral votes or joining a popular-vote compact, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the rules are consistent everywhere. That keeps states meaningfully involved while aligning outcomes more closely with what voters actually chose and lowering the temperature when elections are close.",
    "760": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make presidential elections easier to justify in plain terms: the candidate who earns the most support nationwide should win, and every ballot should carry equal weight regardless of state lines. At the same time, I take seriously the concern that a purely winner\u2011take\u2011all map leaves many communities feeling ignored, so I\u2019d support a practical path like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. The common ground is that legitimacy comes from rules that are transparent, hard to game, and stable enough that people can accept the result even when they lose.",
    "49": "I want a presidential election that feels fair and easy to explain: your vote shouldn\u2019t count for more or less just because of the state you\u2019re in, and it\u2019s wild that campaigns can ignore most of the map. The best bridge, to me, is ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or moving through the National Popular Vote compact), paired with clear nationwide standards for access, audits, and recounts so people trust the count. That keeps states in the mix and nudges candidates to show up for both big metros and smaller communities, instead of just gaming a few swing states.",
    "478": "I\u2019ve come to believe the best fix is one that honors our state-based structure while making the outcome match the will of voters more reliably, because trust breaks when people feel the map matters more than their ballot. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation nationwide\u2014or, better yet, adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once enough states join\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts. That combination keeps every region at the table, reduces swing-state gamesmanship, and makes the result easier for neighbors to accept even when they\u2019re disappointed.",
    "46": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make the outcome track the will of voters more closely, because when a system consistently feels \u201coff by design,\u201d trust erodes and people stop believing the data in front of them. The best bridge I see is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional elector allocation\u2014or using a popular-vote compact as a transition\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, auditing, and recount triggers so the process is transparent and hard to game. That combination keeps states meaningfully involved while making campaigns compete for votes everywhere, not just in a few high-leverage zip codes.",
    "388": "I want a presidential election system I can explain in plain language and feel good about teaching kids: every vote should matter, outcomes should track the will of voters, and the rules should be clear, consistent, and easy to audit. The best bridge to me is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide, paired with uniform standards for ballot access, paper trails, and automatic recount thresholds. That keeps states meaningfully involved and eases fears about any one region dominating, while reducing the swing-state roulette that leaves too many communities feeling written off.",
    "383": "I want a presidential election system I can explain to kids with a straight face: every vote should matter about the same, and the rules should be clear, consistent, and hard to game. Rather than keep the winner-take-all setup that turns most states into spectators, I\u2019d move toward a national popular vote through the interstate compact or require proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so people trust the count. That\u2019s a fair shake for big cities and small towns alike, and it would push candidates to show up everywhere instead of camping out in a few swing states.",
    "632": "I want a presidential election that feels fair and easy to explain: the person who gets the most votes should win, and no one\u2019s ballot should matter less because of where they live. If we\u2019re not ready to fully replace the Electoral College, we should at least end winner-take-all by moving to proportional electors or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, paired with clear national standards for access, counting, audits, and recounts so results are trusted. That keeps states involved and reassures smaller communities they won\u2019t be ignored, while pushing candidates to compete beyond a handful of swing states.",
    "313": "I want a presidential election that feels as plain and fair as counting heads at a community meeting\u2014where every vote matters and the winner matches the country\u2019s choice, not quirks of the map. If we\u2019re not ready to move straight to a national popular vote, I could support ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and using the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact as a careful bridge. Either way, we need clear, consistent rules for access, counting, audits, and recounts so people in big cities and small towns alike can trust the result and move on together.",
    "604": "I want a presidential election that works like a solid repair job: simple rules, the same standards everywhere, and a result that matches what voters actually chose so nobody feels the system is rigged. I\u2019m open to keeping a state role, but we should end winner-take-all by moving to proportional electors or the National Popular Vote compact, with clear national rules for counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. That way every vote matters more, candidates have reasons to compete beyond a few swing states, and smaller communities aren\u2019t treated like an afterthought.",
    "353": "I see why people want \u201cone person, one vote,\u201d and I also see why others don\u2019t want presidential campaigns to turn into a race to rack up margins in a few big metro areas while smaller communities get brushed off. A reasonable compromise is to keep the state-based system but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) allocation of electors, paired with clear, consistent national rules for secure voting, audits, and recounts. That would make more votes matter in more places and give the country a result that feels fair, steady, and easier to trust even when your side loses.",
    "171": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain, fair to every voter, and hard to game, because trust in the rules is what keeps people showing up and accepting results even when they\u2019re disappointed. The best path is moving toward a result that matches the national popular vote\u2014ideally through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or by ending winner-take-all with proportional electors\u2014paired with clear, consistent national standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts. That keeps states meaningfully involved while reducing the swing-state distortion and making campaigns compete for voters everywhere, not just in a few zip codes.",
    "603": "I want a presidential election that people can explain at the kitchen table and trust, where every vote feels like it counts and candidates have reasons to listen to communities beyond a few swing states. The best bridge, to me, is moving away from winner-take-all\u2014through proportional allocation or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with clear, consistent national standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts. That respects the role of states and regional voices while making outcomes line up more closely with what voters actually choose.",
    "193": "I want a presidential election system that feels fair and easy to explain: if more people vote for you, you should win, and no one\u2019s voice should shrink just because of the state they live in. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or through the National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the process is consistent and trusted. That keeps states involved and avoids the fear of \u201cbig cities deciding everything,\u201d while pushing candidates to compete for votes everywhere instead of gaming a few battlegrounds.",
    "158": "I want a presidential election that feels as straightforward and fair as keeping a building running: clear rules, consistent standards, and an outcome people can trust even when they\u2019re disappointed. The best common-ground path is to move away from winner-take-all by having states allocate electors proportionally or join a popular-vote compact, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That keeps states meaningfully involved while making every vote matter more and pushing candidates to show up for communities beyond a handful of swing states.",
    "545": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes people feel like their vote counts no matter which state they\u2019re in, because when the rules feel arbitrary trust breaks down fast. The common ground I see is keeping stability while fixing winner-take-all distortions, so I\u2019d support moving toward a national popular vote through the interstate compact or requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear nationwide standards for counting, audits, and recounts. If we also add ranked-choice voting, candidates would have to build broader coalitions and show up for more communities instead of only chasing a few battlegrounds.",
    "799": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap a system that asks candidates to win support across many states, but it\u2019s hard to defend winner-take-all rules that make millions of votes feel like they don\u2019t matter and turn the whole race into a handful of battlegrounds. A sensible reform is to keep the Electoral College while requiring proportional or district-based allocation, with clear national standards for voter rolls, ballot security, and automatic recounts so the results are fair, auditable, and accepted. That kind of steady, practical fix respects the country\u2019s regional balance while making outcomes track the public\u2019s voice more closely.",
    "382": "I want a presidential election that feels like a clean, fair count where every vote matters, not a game where a few swing states get all the attention while most communities are written off. A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional elector allocation (or using the National Popular Vote compact once enough states join), paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the rules are consistent and trustworthy. That respects the idea that different regions should be heard while making outcomes line up better with what voters actually chose.",
    "318": "I want a presidential election that feels fair and easy to explain to my kids: your vote matters the same whether you live in a crowded city or a small town, and the rules don\u2019t change depending on the state. To me, the best middle ground is keeping elections run by states but ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional electoral votes or joining a national popular vote compact, paired with clear national standards for counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. That would reduce the swing-state game, protect trust in the results, and still push candidates to earn support across the whole country.",
    "654": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes people feel like their vote matters whether they live in a big metro area or a small town. A practical way to bridge the divide is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or using the National Popular Vote compact once enough states join), paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the process is consistent and trusted. That keeps the role of states intact while making outcomes track the popular will more closely and reducing the sense that a few battleground zip codes decide everything.",
    "43": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and fair enough that people can accept the outcome even when they\u2019re disappointed. The clearest path is to move toward the national popular vote\u2014ideally through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact as a bridge\u2014while pairing it with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts to build trust. If that transition isn\u2019t feasible soon, ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally would still make more votes matter in more places without erasing the role of states.",
    "752": "Back in my day, people could disagree about politics without assuming the whole system was crooked, and I\u2019d like reforms that rebuild that kind of trust\u2014clear rules, strong audits, and consistent standards so every lawful vote is counted the same way. I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College outright because it encourages candidates to listen beyond the biggest metros, but I do think winner-take-all should be replaced with a proportional or district-based approach so fewer voters feel written off. If we can balance regional voice with a result that better matches the overall will of the voters, we\u2019ll get a process that feels fair, stable, and easier for everyone to accept.",
    "292": "I want a presidential election system I can explain simply and honestly: every vote should matter, and the winner should reflect the broad will of the people rather than a handful of swing states. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or via the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with clear nationwide standards for ballots, audits, and recounts so the process is consistent and trusted. To address fears of big-city dominance, I\u2019d add reforms like ranked-choice voting that reward candidates who earn support across many communities, not just by running up margins in one place.",
    "683": "I respect the Electoral College\u2019s role in making candidates build a broad, state-by-state coalition, but it\u2019s hard to defend a winner-take-all setup that makes so many voters feel written off and occasionally produces outcomes that don\u2019t match the overall vote. A practical reform is to keep the state-based structure while requiring proportional allocation of electors and binding electors to the state result, paired with clear, consistent national standards for ballot security, audits, and recounts. That kind of steady, understandable fix would make more votes matter without turning the presidency into a fight decided only by a few big media markets or a handful of swing states.",
    "544": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College outright, but the winner-take-all approach in most states feels like a distortion that leaves too many voters\u2014red and blue\u2014thinking their voice doesn\u2019t matter. The most workable common-ground reform is to keep the state-based framework while requiring proportional (or district-based with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) allocation of electors, paired with clear, uniform rules for voter eligibility, ballot handling, audits, and recounts so the process is transparent and trusted. That would preserve the idea that every region has to matter in a presidential race while making outcomes track voters\u2019 choices more closely and reducing the incentive to only campaign in a handful of swing states.",
    "338": "Running a kitchen has taught me that people will accept almost any outcome if the rules are clear, consistent, and everyone can see the process is fair, and our presidential elections should work the same way. I\u2019m drawn to moving toward a national popular vote so every ballot carries equal weight, but I also take seriously the worry that whole regions could feel ignored, which is why I\u2019d support a practical bridge like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors. Pair that with uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts, and we can keep the country\u2019s diverse communities in the conversation while making results easier to trust.",
    "21": "I want a presidential election that feels as straightforward as counting up the votes\u2014where your voice matters the same no matter where you live\u2014and right now the winner\u2011take\u2011all Electoral College makes too many people feel written off. The cleanest direction is a national popular vote, but I\u2019m also open to a bridge like the National Popular Vote compact or proportional electors, paired with clear national rules for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the process is secure and trusted. That way we keep campaigns focused on the whole country instead of a few swing states, while still respecting the fear that smaller communities could be ignored.",
    "805": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s simple to explain, hard to game, and fair enough that people accept the result even when their side loses\u2014because in real life, clear rules and honest diagnostics are what keep trust from breaking down. The best middle ground to me is ending winner-take-all by having states award electors proportionally (or through a popular-vote compact that achieves the same result), paired with basic nationwide standards for clean audits, recount triggers, and ballot handling. That keeps states in the driver\u2019s seat while making more votes matter in more places and pushing candidates to compete beyond a few battleground zip codes.",
    "248": "I want a presidential election system that people can explain plainly, audit confidently, and accept even when their side loses, and it\u2019s hard to defend winner-take-all rules that make so many votes feel irrelevant outside a few battlegrounds. The most workable bridge to me is moving toward the national popular vote\u2014through the interstate compact or proportional elector allocation\u2014paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, paper trails, and automatic audits in close races. That keeps the focus on \u201cone person, one vote\u201d while addressing the fear that any one region will dominate by pushing candidates to earn broad, cross-country support.",
    "111": "I don\u2019t want to rip out a load\u2011bearing part of our system, but I also think it\u2019s hard to defend winner\u2011take\u2011all rules that make most states feel like spectators and occasionally produce results that don\u2019t match the broad will of voters. A practical reform is to keep the Electoral College while requiring proportional (or carefully designed district\u2011based) allocation of electors, paired with clear, uniform national standards for ballot integrity, audits, and recounts so the process is transparent and trusted. That keeps the federal balance people value while making campaigns compete for more voters in more places and making close outcomes easier to accept.",
    "686": "I\u2019m not eager to tear out a load\u2011bearing part of the Constitution, but I do think the winner\u2011take\u2011all habit in most states has turned presidential elections into a few swing\u2011state battles and left too many people feeling like their vote doesn\u2019t matter. A fair middle path is to keep the Electoral College while requiring states to allocate electors proportionally or by district, paired with clear, consistent national rules for ballot security, audits, and recounts so everyone can trust the count. That keeps smaller places from being ignored without pretending the national popular will shouldn\u2019t carry real weight.",
    "406": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College outright because I value the federal balance and the need for presidents to earn support across regions, but I also think winner-take-all rules in most states distort outcomes and make too many voters feel irrelevant. A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework while requiring proportional (or district-based with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) allocation of electors and binding electors to the certified vote, paired with clear national standards for audits, recounts, and ballot security. That would make results easier to accept as fair and square, reduce the swing-state obsession, and strengthen confidence without blowing up a load-bearing system.",
    "62": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s simple to explain to the families I serve and easy to trust: every eligible vote should carry as close to the same weight as possible, and the rules for access, counting, audits, and recounts should be clear and consistent nationwide. If we\u2019re not ready to fully move to a national popular vote, we can still reduce the \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions by allocating electors proportionally or through a popular-vote compact, so candidates have incentives to show up beyond a handful of swing states. That kind of step-by-step reform respects the role states play while making outcomes feel fairer\u2014and when the process feels fair, it\u2019s easier for communities to accept results and move forward together.",
    "159": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every vote feel like it counts, because when outcomes hinge on a few swing states it erodes trust fast. The cleanest destination is a national popular vote, but I\u2019d accept a stepwise path\u2014ending winner-take-all with proportional elector allocation or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That approach respects the role of states and the worry about big-city dominance while still pushing candidates to earn broad support across the whole country.",
    "714": "I\u2019m not eager to toss out a system that makes candidates build support across a big, varied country, but it\u2019s also hard to defend winner-take-all rules that make most states feel like they\u2019re watching from the sidelines. The cleanest middle ground to me is keeping the Electoral College while requiring proportional allocation of electors (or a district method with anti-gerrymandering safeguards), paired with clear, uniform standards for voter eligibility, ballot security, audits, and recounts so the result is fair and square. If we can make the rules simple, transparent, and consistent, we can protect both equal treatment for voters and a meaningful role for the states\u2014and maybe lower the temperature when elections are close.",
    "215": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make the outcome track the voters\u2019 will more closely while keeping the process stable, transparent, and hard to manipulate. Ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation of electors\u2014or adopting a national popular vote through an interstate compact\u2014would reduce the \u201cswing-state lottery\u201d without erasing the states\u2019 role overnight. Whatever path we choose should be paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so people in both dense cities and small communities can trust the same rules and accept the result.",
    "310": "I see the appeal of keeping a state-based system that forces candidates to earn support across the country, but it\u2019s hard to defend winner-take-all rules that make millions of votes feel pointless and turn elections into a fight over a few battlegrounds. The most workable middle ground is to keep the Electoral College but require proportional (or carefully designed district-based) allocation of electors, paired with clear, nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount triggers so the rules are simple, transparent, and hard to game. That approach respects federalism and local control while moving closer to the basic idea that votes should matter more equally everywhere.",
    "733": "I want a presidential election system that feels fair in a way I can explain to my kids: the candidate with the most support should win, and every vote should matter no matter what state you live in. At the same time, I take seriously the worry that smaller and rural communities get ignored, so I\u2019d move toward a national popular vote through a practical bridge like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional elector allocation, paired with clear national standards for voting access, audits, and recounts. If we focus on transparency and consistent rules instead of winner-take-all incentives, we can protect both legitimacy and the sense that every community counts.",
    "180": "I want a presidential election that feels fair and easy to explain to my kids: your vote should matter no matter where you live, and the rules should be clear, consistent, and auditable. Instead of clinging to winner-take-all, I\u2019d support a practical shift toward a national popular vote\u2014through the National Popular Vote compact or proportional elector allocation\u2014paired with uniform standards for access, counting, and recounts so the process is trusted. I also take seriously the worry that campaigns will ignore smaller communities, which is why reforms like ranked-choice voting and incentives to compete broadly should be part of the package. The point isn\u2019t to advantage a party; it\u2019s to modernize the system so it\u2019s resilient, transparent, and representative.",
    "176": "I want a presidential election system that feels fair and easy to explain\u2014where the winner matches the voters\u2019 choice more often and people don\u2019t feel written off just because they live in a \u201csafe\u201d state. A good compromise is to keep states involved but end winner-take-all by splitting electoral votes proportionally (or through a national popular vote compact), paired with clear nationwide standards for counting, audits, and recounts so everyone trusts the process. That way big cities don\u2019t get to ignore smaller communities, but smaller communities also can\u2019t override the majority, and candidates have a reason to show up everywhere.",
    "811": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make the presidential result track the national will more closely, because systems endure when they feel fair, teachable, and worthy of public trust. A workable bridge is ending winner\u2011take\u2011all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or using a national popular vote compact) while adopting clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close contests don\u2019t become chaos. That keeps states meaningfully involved and reassures smaller communities they won\u2019t be ignored, while giving every voter a stronger reason to believe their ballot truly matters.",
    "242": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make outcomes track the voters\u2019 choice more closely while keeping a meaningful state role, since winner-take-all rules and swing-state incentives are hard to justify in a system people need to trust. A practical bridge is proportional allocation of electors (or the National Popular Vote compact) paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the process is transparent and consistent everywhere. That combination respects concerns about regional balance without giving any voter\u2019s ballot extra weight just because of geography.",
    "767": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College outright, because I do think it pushes candidates to build support across regions instead of just running up totals in a few major metros, but the winner\u2011take\u2011all setup in most states makes too many votes feel pointless and fuels distrust when outcomes don\u2019t match the broader will. A middle-ground reform I can get behind is requiring states to allocate electors proportionally (or by district with strong anti\u2011gerrymandering safeguards), paired with clear, consistent national standards for counting, audits, and close-race recounts. That keeps the state role and stability people value while making results easier to defend as fair and hard to game.",
    "492": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and legitimate even when my side loses, and it\u2019s tough to defend winner\u2011take\u2011all rules that make most voters irrelevant while a few states get all the attention. The common ground I see is moving closer to \u201cone person, one vote\u201d without pretending regional concerns don\u2019t exist\u2014either through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with clear nationwide standards for ballots, audits, and recounts. If we do that, campaigns have incentives to compete everywhere, and the result is more likely to match the country\u2019s actual choice in a way people can trust.",

    "454": "I want a presidential election that feels fair and easy to explain\u2014like a clean photo edit where the final image actually matches what was captured\u2014so it bothers me that winner-take-all rules can make millions of votes feel like background noise. The most workable bridge, to me, is moving toward the national popular vote through steps like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear, consistent nationwide standards for ballots, audits, and recounts. That keeps states meaningfully involved and reassures smaller communities they won\u2019t be ghosted, while making every voter\u2019s voice count more equally and lowering the temperature when races are close.",
    "430": "I want a presidential election that feels plain, fair, and worth showing up for\u2014where my vote counts just as much as anyone else\u2019s and the result doesn\u2019t hinge on a handful of swing states. The best path to me is moving toward the national popular vote, either through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or by ending winner-take-all and splitting electors proportionally so more votes matter in every state. To meet the worry about big cities drowning out smaller places, I\u2019d pair any change with clear, consistent rules for voting and recounts and reforms like ranked-choice voting so the winner has broad support. If we keep the focus on equal weight, transparency, and trust, I think most people could accept the outcome even when it\u2019s not their side.",
    "240": "I\u2019m reluctant to scrap a load\u2011bearing institution that was designed to force broad, cross\u2011regional coalitions, but I also think the winner\u2011take\u2011all approach in most states distorts incentives and chips away at confidence when outcomes diverge from the popular vote. A workable reform is to keep the Electoral College while requiring proportional (or carefully designed district) allocation of electors, paired with clear nationwide standards for voter eligibility verification, ballot handling, audits, and automatic recount thresholds. That combination would make more votes matter in more places, reduce the swing\u2011state obsession, and strengthen legitimacy without turning every close election into a chaotic national recount.",
    "785": "I see the value in keeping states meaningfully involved so presidents have to build broad, cross-regional coalitions, but it\u2019s also hard to defend a winner-take-all setup that makes so many votes feel irrelevant outside a few battlegrounds. The most workable middle ground, to me, is requiring states to allocate electors proportionally (or by district with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards) and pairing that with clear, consistent rules for voter ID that\u2019s easy to obtain, secure ballot handling, and transparent audits. If we can tighten the process so it\u2019s fair, simple to explain to our kids, and trustworthy even when our side loses, we\u2019ll lower the temperature without tearing down the whole framework.",

At the same time, I hear the concern about big metro areas drowning out smaller communities, so I\u2019d pair any change with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform rules for ballots, audits, and recounts so the outcome is trusted. If we can end winner-take-all distortions while keeping the process simple and secure, we can lower the temperature and get leaders to campaign for more of the country instead of gaming the map.",

The best bridge, in my view, is to end winner\u2011take\u2011all by allocating electors proportionally (or through a national popular vote compact), while also adopting clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the rules feel fair everywhere. That way we move closer to the popular will without dismissing the real concern that smaller states and rural communities shouldn\u2019t be ignored in national campaigns."
