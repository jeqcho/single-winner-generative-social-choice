    "698": "I respect systems that bring stability and make every region feel included, but it\u2019s hard to accept elections where a few swing places matter more than everyone else. I could support keeping the Electoral College while ending winner\u2011take\u2011all through proportional or district allocation, paired with clear, uniform national standards for secure voting, counting, audits, and recounts. That would honor the role of states and smaller communities while making results match how people actually vote and easier for everyone to trust.",
    "633": "I want a presidential election system that feels easy to understand and fair, where nobody\u2019s vote feels wasted just because of the state they live in, but where smaller communities also don\u2019t get brushed aside. A practical compromise is to keep the state role while ending winner-take-all through proportional or district-based electors, and pair that with clear national standards for voting, counting, audits, and automatic recounts so the results are trusted. If that works smoothly, I\u2019m open to moving further toward a national popular vote through an agreement among states, because legitimacy matters more than protecting a system people don\u2019t believe in.",
    "725": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College outright, but it\u2019s hard to defend a system where campaigns treat most states like they\u2019re off the map and the winner-take-all setup makes too many votes feel like they don\u2019t count. A solid middle-ground fix is to keep the state-based framework while requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, paired with uniform, mission-ready standards for ballot security, audits, and recount triggers so the process is clear and trusted. That would push candidates to build a broader national coalition without letting a few swing counties or a few dense metro areas call all the shots.",
    "629": "I\u2019ve come to value election rules that are steady, easy to understand, and hard to game, and I can see why people want both a clear link to the popular will and reassurance that smaller communities won\u2019t be ignored. Rather than scrapping the Electoral College outright, I\u2019d start by ending winner-take-all in the states through proportional or district-based allocation, paired with uniform, transparent standards for voter rolls, ballot security, audits, and recounts. If those changes build confidence and reduce the swing\u2011state trap, then a broader move toward a national popular-vote outcome becomes easier to consider without tearing at the country\u2019s fabric.",
    "323": "I want a presidential election where the candidate who earns the most support nationwide wins, because it\u2019s getting harder to justify why a vote\u2019s impact depends so much on state lines and a few battlegrounds. At the same time, I take seriously the worry that smaller and rural communities could be tuned out, so I\u2019d favor a practical transition\u2014like the National Popular Vote compact or proportional elector allocation\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for access, counting, audits, and recounts. If we can make the rules simpler to explain and harder to game, people will be more willing to accept the outcome even when it stings.",
    "497": "I\u2019ve always valued steady rules people can understand and trust, and it\u2019s hard to defend a presidential system that makes most campaigns revolve around a few swing states while leaving many voters feeling like spectators. Rather than scrapping the Electoral College overnight, I\u2019d start by ending winner-take-all through proportional or district-based allocation, paired with clear nationwide standards for voter rolls, ballot security, audits, and recounts so results are timely and credible. If those steps prove themselves and build confidence, I\u2019m open to a broader shift toward a national popular vote approach that still respects the federal role states play in running elections.",
    "572": "I\u2019m not in a rush to scrap the Electoral College, but I do think it needs fixing so presidential races don\u2019t come down to a handful of swing states while most folks feel ignored. A fair middle ground is ending winner-take-all by having states split electors proportionally or by district, with clear national baselines for secure voting, clean rolls, and straightforward recount rules so the process is the same and trustworthy everywhere. That keeps smaller communities from getting drowned out, but also makes each vote matter more no matter where you live.",
    "305": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and respectful of every voter, because legitimacy matters more than which side benefits in a given year. The strongest common ground I see is ending winner\u2011take\u2011all so fewer people feel ignored, while also setting clear nationwide baselines for access, counting, audits, and recounts so the process is consistent and trustworthy. If we\u2019re not ready to move straight to a national popular vote, proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with something like the National Popular Vote compact\u2014feels like a practical bridge that keeps states involved while making outcomes track the people\u2019s will more closely.",
    "332": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s simple to explain, treats every ballot with equal weight, and produces results people can audit and trust\u2014because when rules feel inconsistent, confidence collapses fast. A practical way to bridge concerns about fairness and regional voice is to move toward the national popular vote through steps like the National Popular Vote compact or proportional elector allocation, paired with uniform national standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers. That keeps states meaningfully involved while reducing winner-take-all distortions and the outsized power of a few swing areas, so candidates have incentives to compete everywhere.",
    "370": "I don\u2019t love the idea of scrapping the Electoral College overnight, but it\u2019s hard to defend a setup where a few swing states get all the attention and millions of votes elsewhere feel like spectators. The most workable middle ground to me is ending winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional (or district-based) elector allocation, paired with clear national baseline rules for voter ID access, clean rolls, audits, and recount triggers so people trust the count. That keeps the state-based structure and the need for broad geographic support, while making the result track more closely with how people actually voted.",
    "719": "I want a presidential election system that people can explain plainly and accept as legitimate, where campaigns don\u2019t revolve around a handful of swing states and every ballot feels like it truly counts. The cleanest destination is a national popular vote, but I\u2019d be comfortable moving there in steps\u2014ending winner\u2011take\u2011all through proportional allocation or the National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts. That approach respects the federal role of states while answering the fair concern that outcomes shouldn\u2019t regularly drift away from the will of the voters.",
    "422": "I\u2019ve come to believe the simplest measure of legitimacy is that the candidate with the most votes should win, especially when the current setup makes millions of people feel like spectators because they don\u2019t live in a swing state. At the same time, I take seriously the worry that smaller and rural communities could be brushed aside, which is why I\u2019d support a practical transition like the National Popular Vote compact and/or ending winner\u2011take\u2011all with proportional elector allocation. No matter the model, I want clear, uniform standards for access, counting, audits, and recounts so the rules are easy to explain, hard to game, and trusted even when our side loses.",
    "225": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain and feels fair in practice, where my vote matters the same whether I\u2019m in a \u201csafe\u201d state or not, and where the rules are clear enough that people can trust the outcome even when emotions run high. The best bridge I see is moving toward the national popular vote\u2014either through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or by ending winner-take-all with proportional electoral votes\u2014paired with uniform standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers. That combination keeps states meaningfully involved while reducing swing\u2011state distortion and making legitimacy rest on broad, nationwide support.",
    "609": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make the presidency track the national popular will more reliably, because it\u2019s hard to sustain trust when voters feel their ballot matters less depending on their zip code. At the same time, I take seriously the fear that smaller and rural communities could be tuned out, which is why I favor practical steps like ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation and moving toward a National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear, uniform standards for voting access, counting, audits, and recounts. The goal is a system that\u2019s simple to explain, hard to game, and rewards candidates for building genuine, cross\u2011regional coalitions.",
    "160": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s simple to explain, hard to game, and makes every ballot feel like it truly counts, because trust breaks down fast when the rules seem to change depending on where you live. I can see the appeal of keeping smaller and rural communities from feeling ignored, but the \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d setup turns too many voters into spectators and puts too much power in a few swing states. A practical bridge is moving toward a national popular vote\u2014through the interstate compact or proportional electors\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for voting access, counting, audits, and recounts so the result is fair, transparent, and widely accepted.",
    "85": "I want a presidential election where it\u2019s easy to understand and where every vote feels like it matters, not just the ones in a few swing states, but I also get the worry that smaller places could be ignored in a pure national tally. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by having states award electors proportionally (or by district) while setting clear, uniform rules for voting, counting, audits, and recounts so the process is consistent and trusted everywhere. If that still doesn\u2019t fix the fairness gap, I\u2019d be open to a national popular vote through a careful transition like the National Popular Vote compact, as long as the guardrails for transparency and confidence are in place.",
    "17": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, treats every vote as equally meaningful, and doesn\u2019t make the outcome hinge on a few swing states while the rest of the country becomes background noise. The most workable bridge, to me, is moving toward the national popular vote\u2014through the National Popular Vote compact or by ending winner\u2011take\u2011all with proportional elector allocation\u2014paired with clear nationwide baselines for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers so trust rises along with fairness. That combination respects the role states play in running elections while pushing campaigns to earn support across more communities, not just the biggest metros or the closest battlegrounds.",
    "764": "I\u2019m not looking to tear up the Electoral College by the roots, but it does need pruning so elections don\u2019t come down to a few swing spots while whole states feel like their votes don\u2019t matter. A fair middle ground is ending winner-take-all by having states award electors proportionally or by district, backed by clear national baseline rules for voter rolls, ID that\u2019s free and easy to get, audits, and recounts so people trust the count. That keeps the states in the process and makes candidates work for votes everywhere, like keeping a lawn healthy by spreading the attention instead of watering just one corner.",
    "280": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s simple to explain to my kids and feels fair no matter which state you live in, because nobody should feel like their vote only matters in a few battlegrounds. I\u2019m open to moving toward the national popular vote, but I\u2019d rather do it with a steady bridge\u2014ending winner\u2011take\u2011all through proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear nationwide standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts. That way we keep the idea that every region has a stake, while making the outcome line up more closely with the will of the people and harder for anyone to game.",
    "334": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, treats every vote as equally as possible, and produces results people can trust without feeling like a few swing counties are running the whole show. A sensible bridge is to move toward the national popular will\u2014through the National Popular Vote compact or proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for voting access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers. That respects the concern about smaller communities being ignored while also reducing winner-take-all distortions that leave too many voters feeling invisible. If we focus on fairness, transparency, and broad legitimacy instead of partisan advantage, we can modernize the system and lower the temperature around close elections.",
    "561": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s simple to explain and defensible on first principles: the candidate who wins the most votes should win, and every ballot should be treated the same no matter the state. At the same time, I hear the concern about smaller and rural communities being brushed aside, which is why I\u2019d pair a move toward a national popular vote\u2014through a careful transition like the National Popular Vote compact\u2014with clear, uniform standards for access, counting, audits, and recounts. If we can reduce winner-take-all distortions and make the rules transparent and consistent, we can keep faith with federalism while strengthening legitimacy and public trust.",
    "347": "I think the end goal should be simple: the candidate who gets the most votes nationwide wins, because a championship should match the scoreboard, but the rulebook has to make sense to every region. If a full switch feels like too big of a mid\u2011game change, I\u2019d start by ending winner\u2011take\u2011all through proportional electoral votes (or the National Popular Vote compact) and pair it with uniform, transparent standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers. That keeps states in the mix while making more voters feel like they\u2019re actually in the game instead of watching a few swing states decide it.",
    "796": "I want a presidential election system that regular families can understand and trust, where the rules are clear, the counting is secure, and no one feels like their vote is pointless just because they don\u2019t live in a swing state. I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College overnight, but I do think we should end the winner-take-all setup by moving states toward proportional or district-based elector awards, with basic nationwide standards for audits, recounts, and clean voter rolls. That keeps the idea that every region matters while doing a better job matching the outcome to what voters actually chose. If we can agree on fairness and integrity first, the rest is just working out the mechanics.",
    "427": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s straightforward enough to explain and consistent enough that people trust it, because when the rules feel uneven, it\u2019s hard to ask neighbors to accept the outcome and move on together. The best direction is to make the winner match the national popular vote, but I\u2019m open to a practical transition\u2014like the National Popular Vote compact or proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with clear nationwide standards for voting access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers. That respects the real concern about smaller communities being ignored while fixing the \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions that leave too many voters feeling like spectators.",
    "1": "I want a presidential election where the candidate who earns the most support nationwide wins, because it\u2019s hard to defend a system that can turn millions of ballots into strategic noise and make a handful of states the entire campaign. At the same time, I take seriously the fear that a pure headcount could leave rural and smaller-state concerns feeling invisible, so I\u2019d favor a practical bridge like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers. The common ground is legitimacy: rules that are simple to explain, hard to game, and consistent enough that people can accept the outcome even when their side loses.",
    "21": "I want a presidential election where every vote counts the same, and where campaigns have a reason to show up in more than a handful of swing states so people everywhere feel seen. The cleanest destination is a national popular vote, but I can respect the worry about smaller places getting ignored by pairing that shift with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts. If changing the Constitution isn\u2019t realistic right away, ending winner-take-all through proportional electors or using the National Popular Vote compact feels like a practical step that improves fairness without blowing up trust in the process.",
    "517": "I want a presidential election where the person with the most votes wins, because it\u2019s hard to square fairness with a system that makes some ballots count more depending on where they\u2019re cast, and it leaves too many of us feeling like spectators. At the same time, I hear the fear that smaller places will be ignored, so I\u2019d support a practical step like the National Popular Vote compact or proportional elector allocation, paired with clear nationwide standards for voting, audits, and recounts so the rules are the same everywhere. If we can make it simpler to explain, harder to game, and easier to trust, we\u2019d spend less time fighting about the process and more time dealing with the problems people live with every day.",
    "161": "I\u2019ve come to appreciate the Electoral College for encouraging broad, cross-regional coalitions, but I also see how winner-take-all rules and a handful of battleground states can leave too many voters feeling irrelevant and suspicious of the outcome. The common ground, to me, is keeping a meaningful role for states while reforming how electors are awarded\u2014more proportional or district-based\u2014and pairing that with clear, uniform standards for ballot security, counting, audits, and recounts. If we can make the rules simpler, harder to game, and easier to trust, we can protect regional balance without drifting so far from the popular will that legitimacy suffers.",
    "680": "I want a presidential election where every vote carries the same weight and the winner usually matches the national popular vote, but I also take seriously the fear that whole regions could feel ignored and lose trust in the system. A realistic bridge is to end winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear, uniform standards for voting access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts. That keeps states involved, makes campaigns compete beyond a few swing states, and makes the rules simple enough that people can accept the outcome even when they\u2019re disappointed.",
    "622": "I want a presidential election where it\u2019s simple to explain why the person with the most votes wins, and where my vote matters just as much whether I\u2019m in a deep-red, deep-blue, or swing state. At the same time, I get the worry that a pure national tally could make some places feel ignored, so I\u2019d support a practical path like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional electoral votes, paired with clear nationwide standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts. That kind of reform keeps the process stable and transparent, reduces the winner\u2011take\u2011all distortion, and pushes candidates to earn support across the whole country instead of a few battleground zip codes.",
    "183": "I want a presidential election where every vote carries the same weight and the outcome usually matches the popular will, because it\u2019s hard to sustain trust when the rules make most states feel like spectators. At the same time, I don\u2019t want reforms that leave rural and smaller communities feeling written off, so I\u2019d start by ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation (or a well\u2011designed National Popular Vote compact) paired with clear, uniform standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts. If we can agree the goal is legitimacy and broad, cross\u2011regional support\u2014not partisan advantage\u2014we can modernize the system without breaking the federal balance people value.",
    "166": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap a system that keeps states in the game, but it also doesn\u2019t sit right that a handful of swing states can outweigh millions of votes and make most of the map feel ignored. The best middle ground to me is ending winner-take-all by having states award electors proportionally (or by district with fair maps), and pairing that with clear, uniform national rules for counting, audits, and recounts so the process is simple, transparent, and hard to game. If that works and trust grows, I\u2019d be open to a wider move toward a national popular-vote outcome\u2014so long as it still respects local control and doesn\u2019t turn the whole election into one endless court fight.",

The most practical fix to me is keeping the state role while ending winner-take-all through proportional or district-based electors, paired with clear nationwide baselines for voter rolls, ID access, audits, and recount triggers so the outcome is sturdy and trusted.

    "374": "I understand why the Electoral College was meant to keep smaller states and rural communities from being brushed aside, but it also troubles me that a few swing places can end up deciding for everyone and leave many voters feeling invisible. The best path, to my mind, is to keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or by district, paired with clear, uniform rules for secure voting, audits, and recounts so the results are easier to trust. That kind of reform respects local voices while making the outcome track the people\u2019s will more closely, which is what helps the country accept an election and move forward together.",
    "434": "No me convence tirar el Colegio Electoral por completo, porque me importa que las comunidades peque\u00f1as y rurales no queden olvidadas, pero tampoco es justo que todo se decida por unos pocos estados \u201cswing\u201d y que tantos votos se sientan in\u00fatiles. Preferir\u00eda mantener la estructura y cambiar las reglas de \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d por un reparto proporcional o por distritos, con est\u00e1ndares nacionales claros para seguridad, conteo, auditor\u00edas y recuentos para que el resultado se pueda confiar. Si alg\u00fan d\u00eda se camina hacia un voto popular nacional, tendr\u00eda que ser con reglas simples y firmes que den confianza a todos y obliguen a los candidatos a buscar apoyo en todo el pa\u00eds, no solo en las ciudades grandes.",
    "121": "I respect the Electoral College\u2019s role in keeping the country\u2019s regions in the conversation, but it\u2019s hard to defend a setup where campaigns fixate on a few battleground states and millions of votes elsewhere feel like window dressing. A practical way to bridge fairness and federalism is to keep the framework while ending winner\u2011take\u2011all\u2014moving toward proportional or district-based allocation\u2014paired with clear, consistent national standards for voter rolls, ballot security, audits, and recounts. Like any system meant to hold up under pressure, the rules should be simple, transparent, and sturdy enough that people can accept the outcome even when their side loses.",
    "492": "I\u2019m persuaded that a president should be chosen in a way that\u2019s easy to explain and makes every ballot count equally, but I also take seriously the worry that a pure national tally could leave smaller or rural communities feeling ignored. The most workable bridge is to move toward a national popular vote\u2014through a compact or constitutional change\u2014paired with uniform standards for access, counting, audits, and automatic recount thresholds so the rules are consistent and trusted everywhere. If a full shift isn\u2019t feasible soon, ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally would reduce swing-state distortion while keeping states meaningfully involved."
