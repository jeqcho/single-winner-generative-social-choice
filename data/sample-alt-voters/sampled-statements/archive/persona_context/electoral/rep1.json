    "148": "Running a small business and raising kids has made me value rules that are simple, predictable, and fair, and it\u2019s hard to defend a system where your vote can matter more or less depending on your ZIP code. I\u2019d support a practical reform that keeps states involved but ends winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close results don\u2019t turn into chaos. That feels like a workable middle path: it respects the worry about smaller communities being ignored while making outcomes track the voters more honestly and building trust in the process.",
    "662": "I don\u2019t want to throw out a system that pushes candidates to listen to different parts of the country, but it also bothers me when \u201cwinner\u2011take\u2011all\u201d makes millions of votes feel like they didn\u2019t matter. A fair middle step is to keep the Electoral College but require electors to follow the voters and have states award electoral votes proportionally or by district with strong anti\u2011gerrymandering rules. On top of that, we need clear, consistent national standards for voter rolls, ballot counting, audits, and recounts so people can trust the result and move on.",
    "42": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and consistent from state to state, because trust breaks down fast when the rules feel different depending on where you live. I\u2019m open to keeping the Electoral College but ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional (or district-based with strong anti\u2011gerrymandering rules) allocation, while also binding electors and setting clear national standards for ballots, audits, and recounts. That would make more votes matter everywhere without turning the race into a contest focused only on a few big media markets or a handful of swing states.",
    "751": "I\u2019m cautious about ripping out a system that\u2019s helped keep the country stitched together, but it also shouldn\u2019t feel like your vote matters less because of where you live. The best path forward, to me, is keeping the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all through proportional or district-based allocation, binding electors to the voters, and setting clear nationwide standards for ballot handling, audits, and recounts so the rules are steady and trusted. That way we protect smaller communities from being brushed aside while making the outcome track what people actually chose and lowering the temperature after close elections.",
    "235": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and fair enough that people can accept the result even when they\u2019re disappointed. If we can\u2019t move straight to a national popular vote, then ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or in a district-based way with strong anti\u2011gerrymandering rules), along with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts, would make more votes matter without making smaller communities feel written off. The point isn\u2019t to hand an advantage to anyone, but to strengthen trust and encourage candidates to listen beyond a handful of swing states.",
    "797": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College outright, but it shouldn\u2019t feel like the result hinges on a handful of swing counties while millions of votes elsewhere don\u2019t really matter. A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework but require electors to be bound to voters and award electoral votes proportionally (or by district with strong anti-gerrymandering rules), paired with clear national standards for voter rolls, ballot handling, audits, and recount triggers. That would protect the idea of broad geographic support while making outcomes easier to explain, harder to game, and more trusted even when your side loses.",
    "497": "I\u2019m not eager to throw out a system that encourages candidates to listen beyond the biggest cities, but it also shouldn\u2019t feel like your vote matters less depending on which state line you\u2019re on. The best path forward seems like keeping the basic framework while ending winner-take-all\u2014through proportional or district-based electoral votes\u2014paired with clear, consistent national standards for ballots, audits, and recounts so results are trusted and easier to accept. If we can agree the goal is legitimacy and broad coalitions rather than partisan advantage, we can modernize the process without tearing up what\u2019s held the country together.",
    "494": "I\u2019m cautious about scrapping the Electoral College, because I don\u2019t want presidential campaigns to become a numbers game where whole regions get written off, but I also understand the frustration when winner\u2011take\u2011all makes millions of votes feel pointless. A solid middle path is to keep the state-based structure while requiring electors to follow the voters and pushing states to allocate electoral votes proportionally or by district, paired with clear national standards for clean voter rolls, secure ballots, audits, and recounts. If the rules are consistent and transparent, it\u2019s easier to trust the outcome, accept it, and get back to helping our communities\u2014\u00f3rale.",
    "641": "I\u2019m not convinced we should scrap the Electoral College outright, but I do think we need reforms that make it easier to explain, harder to game, and more legitimate when the race is close. A workable compromise is ending winner\u2011take\u2011all by requiring proportional (or district-based with strong anti\u2011gerrymandering rules) allocation of electors, binding electors to the voters\u2019 outcome, and setting clear nationwide standards for audits, recount triggers, and ballot security. That keeps the incentive for candidates to earn support across many communities while making every vote matter more and giving the country fewer reasons to doubt the result.",
    "198": "I\u2019m open to updating how we choose presidents so the outcome matches the voters\u2019 intent more closely, but I\u2019m cautious about ripping out a load\u2011bearing system without a stable, testable replacement. A practical compromise is ending winner\u2011take\u2011all by moving states toward proportional (or district-based with strong anti-gerrymandering rules) elector allocation, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers so close elections don\u2019t spiral into chaos. Done right, that keeps incentives for candidates to compete across regions while making every vote matter more and strengthening trust in the result.",
    "463": "I keep coming back to the idea that the president should win because they earned the most support, but I also don\u2019t want a change that makes whole regions feel written off or turns every close election into a never\u2011ending fight. A practical bridge is moving away from winner\u2011take\u2011all\u2014through proportional electors or the National Popular Vote compact\u2014paired with clear, nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the rules feel consistent and trustworthy. That kind of update is easier to explain, harder to game, and it pushes campaigns to listen beyond a handful of swing states.",
    "372": "I want a presidential election where the winner matches the will of the most voters, but I also get why people don\u2019t want campaigns to turn into a few big media markets and leave whole regions behind. The best bridge, to me, is ending winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional electors (or a well-structured national popular vote compact), paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close races don\u2019t become trust-crushing chaos. That combination keeps the process stable and understandable while making every vote matter more, no matter where it\u2019s cast.",
    "643": "I\u2019m sympathetic to the instinct that the winner should match the most votes, but I also don\u2019t want to trade one distortion for another by making presidential campaigns rationally focus on a few dense media markets. A workable bridge is to keep the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation (or a fair district method), binding electors to the results, and pairing that with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the rules are predictable and trusted. That combination would make more votes matter in more places, reduce swing-state gaming, and strengthen legitimacy without ripping out a load\u2011bearing part of the system overnight.",
    "308": "I want a system that\u2019s easy to explain, feels fair to every voter, and doesn\u2019t boil the country down to a handful of swing states, because when rules feel arbitrary people stop trusting the outcome. The best bridge I see is moving away from winner-take-all\u2014either through proportional electoral votes in every state or the National Popular Vote Compact\u2014paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close elections don\u2019t turn into chaos. That keeps a meaningful role for states and regional voices while making the result track what voters actually chose.",
    "81": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make the outcome match what voters actually chose, because it\u2019s hard to defend a system where your voice can feel discounted just because of your ZIP code, yet I also don\u2019t want to write off smaller states or rural communities that already feel ignored. The most workable bridge, to me, is moving away from winner-take-all\u2014either through proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote compact\u2014paired with clear, nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the rules are consistent and trust is easier to earn. If we can agree that fairness and legitimacy matter more than partisan advantage, we can modernize the process without turning every close election into a permanent crisis.",
    "464": "I can see why people want the president to match the popular vote, and I also don\u2019t want a system that makes smaller places feel like they don\u2019t matter or turns every close election into a national recount fight. The best path to me is keeping the state-based framework but ending most winner-take-all results by allocating electors proportionally or by district, with electors bound to the voters\u2019 choice and clear, consistent rules for ballots, audits, and recounts. That would make outcomes feel fairer and easier to trust, while still encouraging candidates to earn support across the whole country.",
    "765": "I want a system where the candidate with the most support nationwide wins, because it\u2019s hard to defend outcomes that can diverge from the popular vote and leave people feeling unheard. At the same time, I take seriously the fear that whole regions could be written off, so I\u2019d back a practical transition like the National Popular Vote compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear, consistent national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. The point isn\u2019t partisan advantage\u2014it\u2019s a process that\u2019s simple to explain, hard to game, and trusted enough that we can accept results and get back to serving our communities.",
    "597": "I\u2019m drawn to a system where the candidate with the most votes wins, because that\u2019s the cleanest way to keep faith in the outcome, but I also don\u2019t want entire regions to feel written off while campaigns chase only the biggest media markets. A practical bridge is moving toward the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or ending winner\u2011take\u2011all with proportional electors, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close elections don\u2019t become endless courtroom fights. That combination keeps the process transparent and secure while pushing candidates to earn broad support across the country.",
    "616": "I keep coming back to the idea that election rules should be simple enough to explain at the dinner table and fair enough that people accept the outcome even when it stings. The best bridge I see is keeping the state-run structure but ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional elector allocation, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so every vote is handled consistently. If we want to go further, the National Popular Vote compact\u2014ideally alongside ranked-choice voting\u2014offers a practical way to align results with the national will while still pushing candidates to earn support across regions.",
    "376": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and legitimate enough that families and coworkers can move on from the result and get back to living their lives. The clearest destination is aligning the winner with the national popular vote, but I\u2019d accept a stepwise bridge\u2014ending winner\u2011take\u2011all through proportional electors or a popular-vote compact\u2014paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers. That combination keeps the state role and the need for broad coalitions while making every ballot matter more, whether it\u2019s cast in a dense metro or a small town.",
    "459": "I want a presidential election where every vote carries the same weight and the winner reflects the will of the people, but I also take seriously the fear that whole regions could feel written off if campaigns only chase the biggest population centers. A practical bridge is to move away from winner-take-all by allocating electoral votes proportionally (or through a well-guarded district method) while building toward a national popular vote through an interstate compact, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. If we focus on fairness, transparency, and rules that are consistent everywhere, it becomes easier for communities with very different needs to trust the outcome and move forward together.",
    "776": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that reduce the winner-take-all distortions and the swing-state obsession, because any system that\u2019s hard to explain and easy to game erodes trust and performance over time. A practical path is to keep the state-run framework but require proportional (or district-based with strong anti-gerrymandering rules) allocation of electors, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers. That combination respects concerns about regional voice while making outcomes track voters more closely, and it channels our energy into improving the process instead of relitigating legitimacy every four years.",
    "228": "I don\u2019t want to rip out a load\u2011bearing part of the system and replace it with something that makes huge parts of the country feel ignored, but I also think it\u2019s fair to reduce the winner\u2011take\u2011all distortion so more votes actually matter. A workable compromise is to keep the Electoral College while requiring bound electors and moving states to proportional or district-based allocation with strong anti\u2011gerrymandering rules, paired with clear nationwide standards for voter rolls, ballot handling, audits, and recount triggers. That would push candidates to earn support in more places, make outcomes easier to trust, and let us argue about policy again instead of the rules.",
    "675": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make the outcome match the will of the voters more consistently, because it\u2019s hard to defend a system where a ballot\u2019s impact depends so much on geography and a few swing states. At the same time, I don\u2019t want a fix that simply shifts all attention to a handful of big media markets, so I\u2019d support a practical transition like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. If we prioritize transparency, consistency, and broad coalition-building over partisan advantage, we can make elections feel fairer without destabilizing the system every four years.",
    "339": "I\u2019m persuaded that legitimacy suffers when the presidency can diverge from the national popular vote, but I\u2019m equally mindful that durable rules should not leave whole regions feeling effectively disenfranchised. The most workable bridge is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or fairly drawn district-based) allocation of electors, pair it with binding electors, and adopt uniform national baselines for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers so disputes are resolved transparently and promptly. If that proves insufficient, a carefully designed national popular vote\u2014ideally with ranked-choice and clear recount standards\u2014would better align outcomes with voter intent while still rewarding candidates who build broad, cross-regional coalitions.",
    "124": "I\u2019m not looking to blow up the Electoral College, but I do think we can reduce the winner-take-all distortion so people in every state feel their vote matters and campaigns aren\u2019t just a swing-state scavenger hunt. A workable compromise is to keep the state-based framework while requiring electors to follow the vote and allocating them proportionally (or by district with strong anti-gerrymandering rules), paired with clear national baselines for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That approach respects the need for broad geographic support while strengthening fairness, transparency, and trust in close elections.",
    "237": "I\u2019m not interested in tearing down a system that has helped hold a big, diverse country together, but I also think it\u2019s hard to defend winner\u2011take\u2011all outcomes that can make millions feel like their votes were functionally irrelevant. The compromise I can live with is keeping the Electoral College while requiring electors to be bound to results and moving states toward proportional or district-based allocation, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the process is secure, consistent, and easier to trust. If reforms are framed around legitimacy, transparency, and broad coalition-building\u2014rather than partisan advantage\u2014we can protect smaller communities from being ignored while making the outcome better match what voters actually chose.",
    "128": "I want a presidential election where the winner is the one most voters actually chose, because rules that don\u2019t match the plain count invite endless suspicion and nitpicking. At the same time, I don\u2019t want campaigns to write off whole regions, so I\u2019d push for ending winner-take-all with proportional elector allocation as a near-term step, and move toward a national popular vote once there are clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That combination keeps the process stable and state-run, but makes every vote matter more and gives people on all sides a cleaner result they can trust.",
    "215": "I\u2019m persuaded by the basic fairness of having the presidency track the national popular vote, but I also take seriously the concern that large regions can feel written off when politics becomes a pure numbers game. The most workable bridge, in my view, is a national popular-vote outcome achieved through an orderly mechanism like an interstate compact, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so close elections don\u2019t devolve into suspicion and litigation. If that proves out of reach, ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation would still make more votes matter in more places while preserving the federal structure people rely on.",
    "0": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make the winner line up with the will of the voters while keeping the process stable and easy to trust, because confidence in the rules matters as much as the outcome. The best bridge I see is ending winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional allocation (or a well-designed popular-vote compact) and pairing that with clear, consistent national standards for access, counting, audits, and recounts. That approach keeps candidates accountable to a broad range of communities instead of just a few battlegrounds, and it\u2019s a change I think people can support even if they disagree on whether the long-term goal should be a full national popular vote.",
    "590": "I\u2019m not eager to rip out a constitutional system that has generally kept transitions orderly, but it\u2019s also hard to defend winner\u2011take\u2011all rules that make millions of votes feel irrelevant and occasionally produce a result that doesn\u2019t match the country\u2019s overall choice. The most workable middle ground is to keep the Electoral College yet require electors to be bound to results and have states allocate votes proportionally or by district under firm, uniform national standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts. That would push campaigns to compete in more places, protect regional balance, and give more Americans confidence that the rules are fair even when their side loses.",
    "596": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap a system that pushes candidates to earn support across the whole country, but it shouldn\u2019t be so winner\u2011take\u2011all that millions of voters feel written off and legitimacy takes a hit. A workable compromise is to keep the Electoral College while requiring electors to follow the voters and allocating electoral votes proportionally or by district under firm, uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That would reduce swing\u2011state gamesmanship, make outcomes easier to accept, and keep the focus on broad coalitions rather than procedural fights.",
    "31": "I\u2019m cautious about scrapping a load\u2011bearing part of the Constitution, but it\u2019s also hard to defend a system where \u201cwinner\u2011take\u2011all\u201d means millions of votes effectively don\u2019t matter and a handful of states get all the attention. The most workable compromise to me is keeping the Electoral College while requiring proportional (or district\u2011based, with strong anti\u2011gerrymandering rules) allocation and binding electors to the vote, paired with clear national standards for voter rolls, counting, audits, and recounts. That preserves the federal balance people value while making outcomes track the voters more closely and boosting confidence that the rules are fair no matter who wins.",
    "698": "I don\u2019t want to throw out a system that has helped keep the country steady, but it also bothers me when the result can feel far from what most voters chose and when a few battleground places get all the attention. A fair middle way is to keep the Electoral College while ending winner\u2011take\u2011all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with strict rules against gerrymandering), and to set clear national standards for secure ballots, audits, and recounts so the process is simple and trusted. That would push candidates to listen to more communities, protect regional balance, and still respect the basic idea that every vote should matter.",

I can see the value in keeping a state-based role so campaigns don\u2019t write off smaller communities, but I\u2019d end winner-take-all by moving toward proportional allocation (or a carefully designed popular-vote compact) and pair it with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That kind of reform protects regional voice while making outcomes track voter intent more closely and lowering the temperature after close elections.",
    "568": "I\u2019m not convinced we should scrap the Electoral College outright, but I do think the winner\u2011take\u2011all setup and loose, patchwork rules feed distrust and make too many voters feel written off. A workable middle ground is to keep the state-based framework while requiring electors to follow the statewide vote and shifting to proportional or district-based allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering guardrails. Pair that with clear national baselines for voter roll accuracy, ballot security, audits, and recount triggers so close races are resolved transparently and people can accept the outcome even when their side loses.",
    "686": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College, because a good system should make candidates take the whole country seriously, not just run up the score in a few big places, but it also shouldn\u2019t leave people feeling like their vote counts less depending on where they live. A steady reform I can live with is ending winner-take-all by having states award electors proportionally or by district, while binding electors to the voters\u2019 choice and setting clear national rules for ballot security, audits, and recounts. That keeps the state-based balance many value, makes outcomes feel fairer, and helps more folks trust the result even when their side loses.",

The cleanest bridge is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide (or a popular-vote compact once uniform standards are in place), paired with clear, consistent rules for access, auditing, and recounts so close elections don\u2019t become trust-crushing legal wars. If we can keep the process simple, transparent, and hard to game, we can protect both majority rule and the sense that every community still matters.",

The most workable bridge to me is ending winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional electoral votes (or joining the National Popular Vote compact once there are clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts).

If the rules are transparent, consistent, and easier to explain, candidates will have stronger incentives to compete everywhere and more people will trust the outcome even when their side loses.",
    "614": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make it easier to explain to my kids why every vote matters, while still respecting the feeling many communities have that they shouldn\u2019t be written off just because they\u2019re not in a big metro area. The cleanest direction is a national popular vote\u2014ideally through a practical step like the National Popular Vote compact\u2014paired with clear, consistent rules for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the results are trusted. If that\u2019s not achievable soon, ending winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional electoral votes feels like a fair bridge that lowers the temperature and pushes candidates to listen in more places.",
    "738": "I\u2019m not sold on ripping out the Electoral College entirely, but the current winner-take-all setup feels like a system that runs fine until one worn part throws the whole result out of alignment with what voters actually did. A solid middle-ground fix is to keep the state-based framework while requiring electors to follow the vote and allocating them proportionally (or by district with strict anti-gerrymandering rules), paired with clear, consistent national standards for counting, audits, and close-election recounts. That keeps smaller places from getting treated like flyover country, while making it easier for everyone to trust that the winner earned it fair and square.",
    "758": "I want a system where the person who gets the most votes becomes president, because it\u2019s hard to accept rules that make some votes count more just because of the state line. At the same time, I don\u2019t want elections to be only about big cities, so I\u2019d support a practical step like ending winner\u2011take\u2011all with proportional electoral votes or the National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear national rules for counting, audits, and recounts. That keeps the process stable and trustworthy while pushing candidates to earn support in more places, not just a few swing states.",
    "20": "I want a presidential election where the winner is clearly the choice of the most voters, but I also take seriously the fear that whole regions could feel written off if we flip the system overnight. The best path looks like ending winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional electoral votes (or a popular-vote compact with broad buy-in) and pairing that with simple, uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so people can trust the count. That keeps the incentive for broad, cross-regional campaigning while making outcomes feel fairer and easier to accept, even when your side loses."
