    "346": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make the outcome track the national popular vote more directly, because it\u2019s hard to sustain trust when millions of ballots feel discounted by geography, yet I don\u2019t want smaller and rural communities to feel written off in the process. A practical bridge is moving toward a national popular vote through an interstate compact, paired with ranked-choice voting so the winner reflects broad support and not just narrow pluralities. Whatever model we choose should come with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts, because legitimacy in a close contest depends on rules that are consistent, transparent, and easy to explain.",
    "574": "I\u2019m cautious about scrapping the Electoral College outright, but I do think the winner\u2011take\u2011all approach has turned too many states into spectators and a few battlegrounds into kingmakers. A sensible compromise is to keep the state-based structure while encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors, alongside clear, uniform rules for ballot handling, audits, and recounts so people can trust the count. That way we protect regional voices without ignoring the plain fairness of making more votes matter in more places.",
    "283": "I want a presidential election where every vote carries the same weight and campaigns have a reason to show up everywhere, not just in a few swing states. The cleanest path is a national popular vote\u2014ideally via the National Popular Vote compact\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform rules for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts so people trust the result. If that full shift isn\u2019t doable yet, ending winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional elector allocation would make more voters matter while keeping a role for states.",

    "767": "I\u2019m not convinced we should scrap the Electoral College outright, because I want candidates to have to earn support across the whole map, not just run up totals in a few big metro areas. But the winner\u2011take\u2011all approach in most states makes too many votes feel pointless and puts way too much power in a handful of swing states, so I\u2019d back reforms like proportional or district-based allocation paired with clear national standards for ballot security, audits, and recounts. If we can make the system both more representative and more trustworthy, it gets a lot easier for people to accept the outcome and move on.",
    "285": "I want a presidential election where every ballot carries the same weight and the outcome is easy to explain and trust, because cynicism grows when people feel written off based on where they live. A realistic bridge is moving toward a national popular vote\u2014through the National Popular Vote compact if that\u2019s what\u2019s achievable\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. That combination honors the desire for equal voice while addressing the fear that candidates will ignore smaller communities by rewarding broad, cross\u2011regional support instead of narrow swing\u2011state strategies.",
    "8": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make it easier to explain\u2014and to accept\u2014that the person with the most support from voters should win, because trust depends on rules that feel fair and consistent everywhere. At the same time, I don\u2019t want whole regions written off, so I\u2019d support moving toward a national popular vote through a practical step like the National Popular Vote compact, paired with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform standards for counting, auditing, and recounts. That combination keeps campaigns focused on building broad coalitions instead of chasing a few swing states, while reassuring smaller and rural communities that their voices still matter in the final outcome.",
    "375": "I want a presidential election where every vote counts the same and the rules are clear enough that families can trust the result and move on, instead of feeling like a handful of swing states decide everything. The cleanest path is moving toward a national popular vote, but only with uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts so it\u2019s fair and secure everywhere. To address the worry that smaller and rural communities get ignored, I\u2019d pair that shift with ranked-choice voting so candidates have to earn broad, cross\u2011regional support, not just rack up margins in a few places.",
    "229": "I\u2019m cautious about scrapping the Electoral College outright, because I\u2019ve seen how smaller communities can get overlooked, but I also think winner\u2011take\u2011all rules make too many voters feel written off and fuel distrust when the outcome doesn\u2019t match the overall vote. A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework while requiring states to allocate electors more proportionally (or by district) and setting clear, uniform standards for ballot handling, audits, and recounts. That would push candidates to earn support in more places, make results easier to accept, and strengthen confidence that every lawful vote is counted fairly.",

A practical bridge is moving toward the national popular vote through the National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts so the outcome is trusted. If a full shift isn\u2019t in the cards yet, ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally would be a solid step that respects state roles without erasing millions of voters.",
    "649": "I\u2019m not eager to throw out a system that makes candidates think about more than just the biggest media markets, but it\u2019s also hard to defend winner-take-all rules that leave a lot of voters feeling like their ballot didn\u2019t matter. A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College while requiring states to allocate electors proportionally or by district, and pair that with clear, consistent national standards for ballot handling, audits, and recounts so people trust the results. If we can make the outcome track the voters more closely without sidelining smaller communities, we\u2019ll lower the temperature and strengthen confidence in whoever wins.",
    "224": "The Electoral College may have been a sturdy scaffold once, but today it too often turns whole states into spectators and leaves people doubting whether their vote truly counts. I can see the legitimate fear that a pure popular vote could make smaller communities feel unheard, so I\u2019d support moving toward a national popular vote paired with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts\u2014rules that are simple enough to explain at the kitchen table and consistent enough to trust. That combination keeps the focus on majority support while pushing candidates to earn broad, cross-regional coalitions instead of gaming a handful of battlegrounds.",
    "44": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that are straightforward, auditable, and treat each ballot as equally as possible, because when the rules are inconsistent or outcomes feel disconnected from the vote totals, trust erodes fast. Moving toward a national popular vote\u2014ideally via a broad interstate compact\u2014makes sense to me, but only if it comes with uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. To address the real worry that campaigns will ignore smaller or rural communities, I\u2019d pair that shift with ranked-choice voting so winners need broad support and candidates have incentives to compete beyond a few media markets and swing states.",
    "647": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s straightforward and auditable, where every vote carries the same weight and the outcome is easy to accept even when it\u2019s not my preferred result. Moving toward a national popular vote\u2014ideally with ranked-choice ballots to ensure majority support\u2014makes sense to me, but it should come with uniform national standards for ballot access, recounts, and routine post\u2011election audits so trust doesn\u2019t depend on which state you live in. If a full switch isn\u2019t immediately workable, I\u2019d start by ending winner\u2011take\u2011all through proportional allocation and consider a popular-vote compact as a practical bridge, while keeping incentives for candidates to compete beyond a few big media markets and swing states.",
    "565": "I\u2019m hesitant to scrap the Electoral College outright, but it\u2019s hard to defend a system where campaigns revolve around a few swing states and a lot of voters feel written off before Election Day. A sensible compromise is to keep the state-based structure while ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional (or district-based) elector allocation, paired with clear, uniform rules for ballots, counting, audits, and recounts so the results are trusted. That would make outcomes track voter intent more closely while still pushing candidates to earn support across the whole country, not just the biggest cities or the loudest regions.",

The common ground I see is updating the rules so outcomes track voter intent more closely\u2014through proportional or district-based elector allocation\u2014and pairing that with clear, uniform standards for ballot security, auditing, and recounts so the results are solid as a rock. If we can keep incentives for candidates to earn support across the whole map while making every vote count more, we\u2019ll lower the temperature and make it easier for people to accept the outcome and move on.",
    "473": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s simple to explain and honest in its math, where every ballot feels like it matters and the winner usually reflects the most votes nationwide. At the same time, I don\u2019t want reform to translate into whole regions being written off, so I\u2019d favor moving toward a national popular vote through a broad, steady approach\u2014ideally with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform rules for ballots, recounts, and audits. If the country isn\u2019t ready for that all at once, ending winner\u2011take\u2011all by shifting to proportional electoral votes is a practical step that makes results feel fairer without ripping up the whole system.",
    "641": "I\u2019m reluctant to scrap the Electoral College outright because a stable system should force candidates to earn support across the whole country, not just run up margins in a few media-heavy population centers, but I also think winner-take-all rules and swing-state math leave too many voters feeling sidelined. A practical reform is to keep the state-based structure while requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors and binding electors to the state vote, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot handling, audits, and close-election recounts. That approach protects regional voice while making outcomes track voter intent more closely and giving people on all sides a result they can trust.",

    "106": "I\u2019m cautious about ripping out the Electoral College, but it\u2019s also hard to defend winner-take-all rules that make too many voters feel invisible and turn everything into a fight over a few states. The common ground I see is keeping the state-based framework while requiring a more proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with clear national standards for secure voting, transparent audits, and consistent recount rules. That would push candidates to earn support in more places, protect smaller communities from being ignored, and make the final result easier for people to trust even when their side loses.",
    "730": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain and easy to trust: the candidate who earns the most support nationwide should win, because it\u2019s hard to justify why a vote\u2019s impact changes depending on where it\u2019s cast. At the same time, I don\u2019t want campaigns to write off smaller and rural communities, so I\u2019d pair a national popular vote (or the National Popular Vote compact as a practical step) with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts. That combination would reduce the swing\u2011state jackpot, reward broader coalitions, and make it more likely that people accept the results even when their side loses.",
    "531": "I want a presidential election where every vote carries the same weight and the outcome is easy to explain and accept, because a system that hinges on a few swing states undermines trust. The cleanest path is moving toward a national popular vote\u2014ideally via the National Popular Vote compact\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting so winners have broad support and voters can choose honestly without fear of spoilers. To respect concerns about smaller and rural communities being ignored, I\u2019d keep strong state and local roles in running elections but require clear, uniform national standards for access, audits, and recounts so the rules are consistent everywhere.",

The current winner-take-all setup makes too many communities feel ignored, so I\u2019d move toward a national popular vote through a broad interstate compact, paired with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts.

    "225": "I want a presidential election where every vote carries the same weight and the rules are clear enough that people trust the outcome even when their side loses, because I\u2019ve seen how quickly communities shut down when they feel ignored or treated unfairly. Moving toward a national popular vote\u2014ideally through a workable step like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014makes sense to me, but it should come with uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts so close elections don\u2019t spiral into suspicion. To address the fear that smaller and rural places get sidelined, I\u2019d pair that shift with ranked-choice voting so winners need broader support and campaigns have incentives to listen in more than a few battleground markets.",
    "78": "I\u2019m reluctant to scrap the Electoral College outright, but I also think the winner\u2011take\u2011all approach in most states and the outsized focus on a few battlegrounds has worn down trust and left too many voters feeling sidelined. A workable compromise is to keep the state-based framework while requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot handling, audits, and recounts so the rules feel the same everywhere. That keeps smaller communities from being ignored while making outcomes track voter intent more closely and giving people a clearer reason to accept the result and move on.",

If that\u2019s not attainable soon, ending winner-take-all by shifting states to proportional elector allocation would be a steady step that makes more votes matter without ripping up the whole system overnight.",

    "516": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain at the kitchen table and, more importantly, one where every vote carries the same weight so people don\u2019t feel written off because of where they live.

That combination respects the desire for broad, cross-regional support while reducing the winner-take-all swing-state dynamic that keeps fueling distrust.",
    "278": "I\u2019m drawn to a system where the candidate with the most votes nationwide wins, because it\u2019s hard to justify why geography should outweigh equal ballots, and the current setup makes too many voters feel like spectators outside a few swing states. At the same time, I take seriously the fear that a pure popular vote could narrow campaigns to the biggest media markets, so I\u2019d pair a national popular vote (or the compact as a practical bridge) with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform standards for counting, audits, and recounts. That combination would make outcomes easier to explain, harder to game, and more legitimate to accept\u2014whether you live in a dense city or a small town.",
    "451": "I want a presidential election where every vote carries the same weight and the outcome is easy to explain, but I also take seriously the fear that a pure winner-take-all mindset can leave whole regions feeling ignored.

A good middle path is keeping the state-based framework while pushing states to split electors proportionally (or by district) and pairing that with clear, uniform rules for ID options, ballot handling, audits, and close-election recounts so the results are solid ground everyone can stand on. That way big cities don\u2019t drown out smaller communities, but the final outcome tracks the voters more honestly.

    "322": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make the presidency track the national popular vote more directly, because it\u2019s hard to defend a system where turnout and margins in a few states can outweigh millions of other ballots, but I don\u2019t want changes that leave smaller or rural communities feeling written off. A practical bridge is moving toward a national popular vote through the interstate compact while pairing it with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts so the winner has broad support and the process is easy to trust. If that full shift isn\u2019t achievable soon, ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally would still reduce distortions and lower the incentive to campaign only in a handful of swing states.",
    "77": "I\u2019ve lived long enough to see how quickly trust breaks when people feel their vote doesn\u2019t count, and I want a system that\u2019s simple: the candidate with the most votes should win, with clear, uniform rules for ballots, audits, and recounts so nobody doubts the count. At the same time, I don\u2019t want campaigns to forget quiet places, so I\u2019d pair a national popular vote (or the popular\u2011vote compact as a step) with ranked-choice voting to reward broad, cross\u2011regional support instead of narrow swing\u2011state games. If we can keep the rules fair and the process transparent, more of us can accept the result and move on together.",
    "442": "I\u2019ve spent enough years watching young people wrestle with civics to know folks will accept results they don\u2019t like when the rules are plain, consistent, and feel fair\u2014right now the winner\u2011take\u2011all setup makes too many voters feel like spectators. I\u2019d move us toward a national popular vote, but I\u2019d pair it with ranked-choice voting and clear nationwide standards for counting, audits, and recounts so the winner has broad support and people can trust the process. And if we can\u2019t get all the way there yet, ending winner\u2011take\u2011all by shifting to proportional electors is a good \u201cmeet-in-the-middle\u201d step that keeps every community in the conversation."
