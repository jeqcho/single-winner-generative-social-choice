    "29": "I want a presidential election where the winner matches the choice of the most voters, without turning every close race into a chaotic fight over rules and recounts. A practical bridge is to move toward a national popular vote through steps like the National Popular Vote compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, accessibility, audits, and recount triggers so people can trust the outcome. That keeps states meaningfully involved in running elections while reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions that make too many communities feel ignored.",
    "780": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every vote feel meaningful, because when the rules feel arbitrary people stop trusting the outcome. The most workable bridge to me is ending winner\u2011take\u2011all by moving states toward proportional elector allocation (or the National Popular Vote compact once clear safeguards are in place), paired with uniform national standards for ballots, audits, and recount triggers. That keeps a real role for states and regional voices while reducing the \u201cswing state\u201d distortion and making it far more likely the winner matches the country\u2019s overall choice.",
    "328": "I\u2019m not interested in blowing up the Electoral College, but I do think we can fix what drives people nuts: winner-take-all rules that make most states feel ignored and a lack of consistent, trustworthy procedures. A practical reform is to keep the state-based system while awarding electoral votes by congressional district or proportionally, paired with clear national baselines for voter-roll maintenance, secure ID options, paper trails, and routine audits so close races don\u2019t turn into chaos. That keeps smaller communities from getting steamrolled by a few big-city totals, while making more votes matter and giving everyone a cleaner, more believable outcome.",
    "381": "I\u2019m not interested in blowing up a system that helps keep the whole country\u2014small states and big metros alike\u2014at the table, but I also think \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d has turned too many votes into throwaways and put too much power in a handful of swing counties. A solid middle ground is to keep the Electoral College but require states to allocate electors proportionally or by district, paired with clear, uniform national rules for voter rolls, ID options that are easy to obtain, and transparent audits and recount standards. That would make outcomes track voters more closely while keeping elections orderly and easier to trust, even when your side loses.",
    "542": "I\u2019ve spent enough time outdoors and in public service to value rules people can understand and trust, and the current winner-take-all Electoral College leaves too many voters feeling invisible while a few battlegrounds get all the attention. A workable bridge is to keep states administering elections but require proportional allocation of electors (or use the National Popular Vote compact), paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, paper trails, audits, and recounts. That moves us closer to \u201cevery vote counts\u201d without dismissing the real concern that smaller and rural communities shouldn\u2019t be written off.",
    "254": "I want a presidential election that feels as fair and steady as a well-marked trail: every ballot should matter, and the rules should be clear, consistent, and easy to trust. The best bridge to me is ending winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional electoral votes\u2014or using the National Popular Vote compact\u2014paired with uniform standards for access, paper trails, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. That keeps states meaningfully involved and reassures smaller communities they won\u2019t be brushed aside, while also making it much harder for a few swing counties to speak for the whole country.",
    "644": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, treats each vote as equally as possible, and produces results people can accept even when they\u2019re disappointed. The best bridge, to me, is moving away from winner-take-all\u2014either through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts in very close races. That keeps states meaningfully involved while reducing the swing-state stranglehold and giving rural and urban communities alike a real reason to expect candidates will listen to them.",
    "78": "I\u2019m cautious about scrapping the Electoral College outright because I value a system that pushes candidates to earn support across regions, not just rack up margins in a few major metros, but I also understand why winner-take-all makes too many voters feel ignored. A workable compromise is to keep the state-based framework while requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors and binding electors to the certified vote, so outcomes track voters more closely without blowing up the structure. Whatever reform we choose should come with clear, uniform rules for voter eligibility, ballot handling, and transparent audits so people can trust the count and accept the result even when their side loses.",
    "319": "I respect the stability of a state-based system, but I also understand why people lose faith when winner\u2011take\u2011all rules make most ballots feel wasted and a few swing areas decide everything. A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College while requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, paired with clear nationwide standards for voter rolls, ID options, paper trails, and transparent audits so the rules feel consistent and trustworthy. If we focus on fairness and order at the same time, we can protect smaller communities from being ignored while making the result easier to accept, win or lose.",
    "615": "I want a presidential election where cada voto cuente de verdad and the winner reflects the people\u2019s choice, but I also understand the need for a clear, orderly process that keeps faith with states and communities that don\u2019t always get the spotlight. A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by moving to proportional elector allocation (or the National Popular Vote compact), paired with simple nationwide standards for ballots, audits, and recounts so results are transparent and trusted. If we keep the focus on fairness and confidence\u2014not partisan advantage\u2014we can modernize the system without tearing the country further apart.",
    "489": "I\u2019m cautious about scrapping the Electoral College outright, but I don\u2019t think \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d is serving us well when it makes most states feel irrelevant and leaves half the country doubting the result. A sensible step is to keep the state-based framework while moving toward proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with clear, consistent rules for voter rolls, verification options, paper trails, and transparent audits so people can trust the count. That kind of reform respects the idea that different regions should matter, while making outcomes track voters\u2019 choices more closely and lowering the temperature after close elections.",
    "448": "I\u2019m hesitant to scrap the Electoral College outright because the presidency should require support that reaches beyond the biggest population centers, but the current winner-take-all approach in most states makes too many votes feel wasted and turns a few battlegrounds into the whole contest. A workable compromise is to keep the state-based structure while moving states toward proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, paired with clear, consistent national guardrails for election security, audits, and recount triggers. That would preserve federal balance while making outcomes easier to explain, harder to game, and more broadly trusted\u2014even when your side loses.",
    "71": "I want a presidential election system that passes a simple fairness test\u2014every eligible vote should matter, and the winner shouldn\u2019t routinely be someone who earned fewer votes\u2014while still keeping an orderly process that people in every state can trust. The most workable bridge to me is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional elector allocation nationwide, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts so close elections don\u2019t spiral into chaos. If we can prove that reform makes campaigns compete beyond a handful of swing states and strengthens confidence in the count, then a national popular vote\u2014ideally with ranked-choice to ensure broad support\u2014becomes a reasonable next step.",
    "304": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every ballot feel like it matters, not just the ones cast in a few swing states. The best bridge to me is ending winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional electors (or the National Popular Vote compact), paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, paper trails, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. That keeps a real role for states and regional voices while aligning outcomes more closely with what voters actually chose, so trust doesn\u2019t depend on which side wins.",
    "88": "I\u2019m hesitant to scrap the Electoral College outright because I don\u2019t want presidential campaigns to become a pure big\u2011metro numbers game, but I also think the winner\u2011take\u2011all approach leaves too many voters feeling written off. The most workable bridge to me is keeping the state-based framework while shifting states toward proportional or district-based allocation, paired with clear national standards for voter rolls, ID options, paper trails, and post\u2011election audits so people trust the count. If reform can make outcomes track voters more closely without inviting endless recount chaos, I think more Americans could accept results even when their side loses.",
    "352": "I\u2019m not keen on tossing out the Electoral College outright, because a president ought to win support that reaches beyond the biggest population centers, but it also isn\u2019t right that a few swing states get to hold the whole country hostage. A sensible compromise is to keep the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all\u2014allocate electors proportionally or by district\u2014and pair that with clear, uniform rules for voter rolls, ID options, audits, and recount triggers so the count is trusted. If we can agree the aim is both fairness and confidence, we can modernize the machinery without turning every close election into a national quarrel that never ends.",
    "15": "I want a presidential election system that people can explain at the kitchen table and trust when it\u2019s close: every lawful vote counted the same way, with clear nationwide standards for voter rolls, ID options, paper trails, and transparent audits. I\u2019m not looking to scrap the Electoral College overnight, but I do think we should end the winner-take-all habit by moving states toward proportional or district-based allocation so fewer votes feel wasted and campaigns have a reason to show up beyond a handful of swing states. If reforms can protect smaller communities from being ignored while better matching the overall will of the voters, that\u2019s the kind of steady, practical change I can get behind.",
    "509": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes folks feel like their vote matters no matter where they live, without turning every close race into a nationwide meltdown. The cleanest bridge to me is ending winner-take-all by having states award electors proportionally (or by district with strong anti-gerrymander rules), paired with simple, uniform standards for recounts and transparent audits so the count is trusted. That keeps states in the mix and small communities from getting ignored, while tracking the popular will more honestly and taking some heat out of the \u201cswing state\u201d circus.",
    "814": "I\u2019ve always believed good systems work like healthy habitats: they\u2019re resilient, understandable, and they don\u2019t leave whole regions feeling ignored, which is why the current winner-take-all Electoral College needs repair even if we keep a state-based framework. I\u2019d start by ending winner-take-all through proportional or district-based elector allocation, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, paper trails, audits, and recounts so the result is trusted. If we can agree that every lawful vote should matter and that campaigns shouldn\u2019t revolve around a handful of swing states, we can move toward a fairer outcome without tearing the country further apart.",
    "666": "I want a presidential election where the winner reflects the people\u2019s choice and every ballot carries equal weight, but I also take seriously the fear that whole regions could feel written off and trust could erode further. The most workable bridge, to me, is moving toward the national popular vote through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (or at least ending winner-take-all with proportional elector allocation), paired with clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, paper trails, audits, and recounts. That combination honors fairness and equality while keeping the process transparent, stable, and credible enough that people can accept the outcome even when their side loses.",
    "147": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, rewards broad support, and makes every vote feel like it counts\u2014because when the rules feel arbitrary, it\u2019s harder to teach the next generation why participation matters. The best bridge I see is moving away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through the National Popular Vote compact) while adopting clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts. That approach keeps states meaningfully involved, reduces the outsized power of a few swing states, and strengthens trust whether you live in a dense city or a small rural community.",
    "493": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s simple to explain, hard to game, and fair enough that people accept the result even when their side loses\u2014right now, winner-take-all and a few swing states make too many voters feel invisible. A workable bridge is to keep states running elections but move toward outcomes that match the national popular vote, either through proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballots, audits, and recounts. Like tending a garden, I\u2019d rather improve the structure step by step\u2014keeping what provides stability while fixing what undermines trust and equal voice.",
    "157": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and leaves people feeling their vote mattered no matter where they live, because legitimacy is the frame that keeps the whole picture from cracking. The cleanest direction is to move toward the national popular vote\u2014ideally through the National Popular Vote compact\u2014while pairing it with uniform, transparent standards for ballots, audits, and automatic recounts in close races so the outcome is trusted. If a full shift isn\u2019t workable yet, ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally is a practical step that reduces \u201cswing state\u201d distortions without pretending regional concerns don\u2019t exist.",
    "663": "I can appreciate why the Electoral College was meant to keep the whole country in view, not just the biggest media markets, but the winner\u2011take\u2011all approach in most states leaves too many people feeling like their vote doesn\u2019t matter and fuels distrust when things are close. A sensible path forward is to keep the state-based framework while allocating electors proportionally or by district, paired with clear nationwide standards for secure ballots, transparent audits, and straightforward recount rules. If we focus on fairness we can explain at the kitchen table and safeguards that build confidence, we can protect local voices and still have results most people can accept\u2014even when their side loses.",
    "261": "I want a system where the person with the most votes becomes president, because it\u2019s hard to accept that your voice can matter less just because of where you live, and that can make people disengage. At the same time, I understand the worry about smaller towns and states being ignored, so I\u2019d support a practical path like ending winner-take-all with proportional electors or the National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear nationwide rules for counting, audits, and recounts so everyone can trust the result. If candidates had to earn support beyond a few swing states, more families would feel seen and the country could focus more on solving problems than fighting over the process.",
    "604": "I want a system that\u2019s simple to explain and hard to game, where the candidate with the most support nationwide wins, but where the rules and recounts are clear enough that people trust the result even in a close race. A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by having states award electors proportionally (or through a national popular vote compact once basic national standards for ballots, audits, and recount triggers are in place). That keeps states involved in running elections while making fewer votes feel \u201cwasted\u201d and pushing candidates to compete beyond a handful of swing states.",
    "488": "I\u2019m not looking to blow up a system that helps keep the whole map in play, but it\u2019s hard to defend winner-take-all rules that make most states feel like spectators and can leave people arguing about legitimacy for years. The common ground, to me, is keeping the state-based structure while allocating electors proportionally or by district, and pairing that with clear nationwide basics for voter rolls, ID options, paper trails, and routine audits so every legal vote is counted the same way. If reforms push candidates to compete in more places and make the rules simpler to trust and explain at the kitchen table, that\u2019s a change worth making.",
    "534": "I want a presidential election system where the winner aligns with the national popular will, but the rules also stay simple, auditable, and consistent enough that people trust the outcome even in a close race. A workable bridge is to keep states administering elections while moving away from winner-take-all\u2014through proportional allocation of electors or the National Popular Vote compact\u2014paired with clear nationwide standards for ballots, recounts, and transparent audits. That approach reduces the swing-state jackpot effect, makes more votes feel meaningful in every state, and focuses reforms on legitimacy rather than partisan advantage.",
    "444": "I\u2019m not eager to blow up a system that helps keep the whole country in view, but it\u2019s hard to defend winner-take-all rules that make millions of ballots feel irrelevant and let a few battlegrounds run the show. The most workable middle ground to me is keeping states in charge of running elections while requiring proportional allocation of electors (or a carefully designed national popular vote compact) with clear, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts. If we focus on equal respect for each voter and a process people can verify and trust, we can reduce gamesmanship without turning every close election into chaos.",
    "6": "I\u2019m not convinced we should scrap the Electoral College outright, because I think the presidency ought to require support that reaches beyond a few dense media markets, but it\u2019s also hard to defend a system where a handful of swing counties get all the attention and millions of votes feel \u201cwasted.\u201d A sensible middle ground is to keep the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all through proportional or district-based elector allocation, paired with clear, uniform rules for voter registration, ballot handling, audits, and recount triggers so people can trust the result. If reforms are built around transparency, security, and broad geographic support\u2014not partisan advantage\u2014I think more Americans could accept outcomes even when their side loses.",
    "655": "I want a presidential election outcome that\u2019s easy to explain and feels fair\u2014where votes aren\u2019t effectively \u201cwasted\u201d just because of the state you live in, but where the process is still orderly and trusted. A practical compromise is to keep the state-run structure while ending winner-take-all through proportional electoral votes or a National Popular Vote compact, paired with clear national standards for ballots, audits, and recounts so close elections don\u2019t spiral into chaos. That balances the goal of one person, one vote with the real concern that candidates shouldn\u2019t only chase a few swing states or a handful of big media markets.",
    "307": "I\u2019m not interested in blowing up a system that\u2019s kept national elections orderly, but I also don\u2019t think it makes sense that a few swing states get all the attention while millions of votes elsewhere feel like they don\u2019t matter. A workable compromise is to keep the state-based framework yet end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or by district, paired with clear nationwide baseline rules for voter rolls, verification, paper trails, and transparent audits. That would reward broad, cross-regional support and give people more confidence that the outcome matches the votes without turning every close race into chaos.",
    "591": "I\u2019m not eager to throw out the Electoral College, because I\u2019ve always valued a system that keeps candidates paying attention to smaller communities and not just the biggest population centers. At the same time, it\u2019s gotten too hard to defend winner-take-all rules that make so many votes feel wasted and put the whole country on edge over a few battleground states. A sensible compromise is to keep the state-based framework but move toward proportional or district-based elector allocation, paired with clear, consistent rules for voter rolls, identification options, and transparent audits so people can trust the count. If we focus on fairness and confidence instead of partisan advantage, we can modernize the process without tearing the country further apart.",
    "514": "I\u2019m not interested in blowing up a system that\u2019s kept the country balanced, but I do think winner-take-all has turned presidential races into a narrow fight over a few battlegrounds and left too many people feeling ignored. The reforms that make the most sense to me keep the state-based structure while allocating electors by district or proportionally, paired with clear, uniform rules for voter rolls, ID options, and transparent audits so the count is trusted everywhere. If the goal is legitimacy, the winner should have broad, cross-regional support\u2014and the rules should be steady enough that both sides can accept the result and get back to work.",
    "187": "I\u2019m hesitant to scrap the Electoral College outright because I want candidates to pay attention to smaller communities and not just rack up votes in a few big cities, but the current winner-take-all setup leaves too many people feeling like their vote doesn\u2019t matter unless they live in a swing state. A commonsense step is to keep the state-based framework while pushing states toward proportional (or district-based) electoral votes and pairing that with clear, uniform rules for voter eligibility, ballot handling, and post\u2011election audits so the results are easier to trust. If reforms are going to stick, they should be simple enough to explain at the kitchen table and focused on fairness and confidence rather than partisan advantage.",
    "721": "I\u2019m hesitant to scrap the Electoral College outright because I don\u2019t want presidential campaigns to become a pure big\u2011city numbers game, but it\u2019s also hard to defend a setup where a few swing states get all the attention and too many votes feel \u201cwasted.\u201d The best middle ground to me is keeping the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all through proportional or district-based allocation, paired with clear nationwide standards for voter roll maintenance, ID options, paper trails, and routine post\u2011election audits. If we can prioritize both fairness and verifiable confidence in the count, we can modernize the system without turning every close election into a nationwide legitimacy crisis.",
    "137": "I don\u2019t see why the presidency should come down to a handful of swing counties, but I also don\u2019t want a rushed overhaul that leaves half the country doubting the count\u2014fair rules and clean, auditable administration are the price of admission. A sensible middle path is to keep the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all through proportional elector allocation (or a carefully designed interstate compact), paired with clear national standards for ballots, recount triggers, and transparent post-election audits. That way more votes matter everywhere, smaller communities still have a seat at the table, and the outcome is easier to accept even when it isn\u2019t the one you were hoping for.",
    "695": "I\u2019m reluctant to scrap a constitutional structure that has helped hold a large, varied country together, but it\u2019s hard to defend a winner\u2011take\u2011all practice that leaves most voters in \u201csafe\u201d states feeling sidelined and turns campaigns into a handful of battlegrounds. The most workable common ground, to my mind, is to keep the Electoral College while requiring electors to be bound and allocating them proportionally (or by district with strong anti\u2011gerrymandering rules), paired with clear nationwide standards for voter rolls, accessible ID options, paper trails, and automatic recounts in close races. That would preserve the federal character many people value while making outcomes easier to explain, harder to game, and more broadly trusted.",
    "632": "I want a presidential election that feels like good operations: clear rules, the same standards everywhere, and a result people can audit and accept even when their side loses. To bridge \u201cevery vote should count the same\u201d with the worry about smaller communities being ignored, I\u2019d start by ending winner-take-all with proportional electors (and strong anti\u2011gerrymandering guardrails if districts are used), then move toward a national popular vote option like the interstate compact paired with ranked-choice voting. That would cut down on swing\u2011state games, make more votes matter in every state, and push candidates to earn broad support instead of just targeting a few places.",
    "256": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain at the dinner table and hard to game, because people work too hard to feel like their vote only matters in a few swing states. The best common-ground path to me is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional electoral votes (or the National Popular Vote compact once clear, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts are in place), so the outcome tracks the people\u2019s will without leaving smaller communities feeling written off. If reforms reward broad, cross-regional support and make the rules consistent and transparent everywhere, we can argue less about the process and more about what leaders will actually do for families.",
    "108": "Running a busy operation has taught me that people accept outcomes when the rules are simple, consistent, and transparent, and right now the winner-take-all Electoral College leaves too many voters feeling ignored while a few battlegrounds get all the attention. I\u2019d move toward a system that guarantees the national popular-vote winner becomes president\u2014either through the National Popular Vote compact or proportional elector allocation\u2014paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, auditing, and automatic recounts in truly close races. That balances the desire for equal weight per vote with the need for stable, trusted results and incentives for candidates to compete beyond the same handful of states.",
    "679": "I\u2019m not looking to scrap the Electoral College overnight, but I do think it should be updated so elections don\u2019t hinge on a few swing counties and so more voters feel like their ballot matters. A good middle path is keeping the state-based structure while ending winner-take-all through proportional or district-based elector allocation, paired with clear nationwide standards for voter rolls, ID options, paper trails, and post\u2011election audits. That balances regional voice with basic fairness and, most importantly, gives people on all sides a process they can trust even when their candidate loses.",
    "77": "Quiero un sistema que sea f\u00e1cil de entender y de confiar: que el que gane tenga el apoyo de m\u00e1s personas y que cada voto pese lo mismo, sin importar el estado. Para tender puentes, me parece razonable movernos hacia un voto popular nacional (por ejemplo con el National Popular Vote compact) y acompa\u00f1arlo con reglas claras y uniformes para contar, auditar y hacer recuentos, para que nadie sienta que el proceso est\u00e1 ama\u00f1ado. Si eso no se logra pronto, al menos deber\u00edamos terminar con el \u201cwinner\u2011take\u2011all\u201d y repartir los electores de forma proporcional, para que menos votos se sientan perdidos y los candidatos tengan que escuchar a m\u00e1s comunidades.",
    "166": "I\u2019m not looking to blow up the system, but I do think it ought to be easier to explain why a vote in one place shouldn\u2019t feel \u201cworth more\u201d than a vote somewhere else, and it bothers me that a handful of swing states get to hog all the attention. A fair middle ground is keeping states in the driver\u2019s seat for running elections while ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional or district-based elector allocation, backed by clear, nationwide minimum standards for ballots, recounts, and transparent audits. That keeps the country from turning into a pure big-city numbers game, makes more votes matter, and gives people on all sides a reason to trust the result even when their candidate loses.",
    "181": "I\u2019m not eager to toss out the Electoral College, because I like the idea that candidates have to pay attention to more than just the biggest cities, but I also don\u2019t think our elections should come down to a few swing counties while millions of votes elsewhere feel pointless. A practical way to meet in the middle is to keep the state-based structure but end winner-take-all by moving to proportional or district-based electoral votes, with clear nationwide standards for voter rolls, ID options that are easy to get, paper trails, and transparent audits. If we can make the rules consistent and the results easier to accept\u2014win or lose\u2014we\u2019d lower the temperature and have more confidence that the process is fair.",
    "640": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make the outcome match the most votes while keeping the process steady and trustworthy, because systems work best when the rules are clear and people can see the checks\u2014paper trails, transparent audits, and consistent recount standards\u2014are solid. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional electoral votes (or using the National Popular Vote compact once strong, uniform guardrails are in place), so fewer ballots feel \u201cwasted\u201d and campaigns have reasons to show up beyond a handful of battlegrounds. If we also pair that with ranked-choice voting, the winner is more likely to reflect broad support, and it gets easier for Americans in very different places to accept the result and move forward.",

Like watching a flock settle into formation, the goal isn\u2019t perfect uniformity\u2014it\u2019s a set of rules that rewards broad support across regions and lets people accept the result even when their side loses.",
    "185": "I want a presidential election where it\u2019s easy to explain to a busy household why their vote matters, no matter what state they live in, and where the winner lines up with the most support from real people. The clearest path is moving toward a national popular vote\u2014through the National Popular Vote compact as a practical step\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting and uniform, transparent rules for ballots, audits, and recounts so close elections don\u2019t turn into chaos. To respect worries about smaller communities being ignored, reforms should push candidates to compete everywhere and make it harder to game the map, not just shift power from one set of \u201csafe\u201d places to another.",
    "366": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make the result line up with the national vote so it\u2019s easier to explain why someone won, but I also don\u2019t want a system that leaves smaller states and rural communities feeling written off. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation (or the National Popular Vote compact once clear guardrails are in place), paired with uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount triggers\u2014basically a consistent, transparent process with a clear paper trail. If we treat this like any high-stakes system where trust is the outcome metric, we can improve fairness without turning every close election into chaos."
