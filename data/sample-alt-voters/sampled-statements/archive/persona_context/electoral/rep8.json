    "256": "I want a presidential election where my vote carries the same weight as anyone else\u2019s and where the rules are clear enough that families can trust the outcome and move on, not argue for years. The most workable bridge to me is ending winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional electors or the National Popular Vote compact, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, paper trails, audits, and recounts. That keeps states in the process and eases fears about big cities dominating, while making campaigns compete for more people instead of only a few battlegrounds.",
    "6": "I see why people want the president to reflect the national popular will, and I also don\u2019t want a system that encourages candidates to write off whole regions or turns every close race into a nationwide recount. A sensible bridge is to keep the state-based framework but end winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional (or district-based) elector allocation, paired with clear, uniform rules for voter verification, paper trails, audits, and recount triggers. That would make more votes matter in more places while protecting trust and stability\u2014so even when emotions run hot, the result feels earned and verifiable.",
    "795": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and auditable\u2014where every vote feels like it counts instead of hinging on a handful of swing states. I\u2019m open to moving toward the national popular vote through a practical bridge like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, or at least ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear national standards for ballots, recounts, and post-election audits. That strikes a balance between voter equality and the real concern that smaller communities shouldn\u2019t be ignored, while rebuilding trust through consistent rules and transparent verification.",
    "802": "I\u2019m not interested in blowing up the Electoral College just to score a win, but I do think it should be tightened and modernized so the outcome tracks what voters actually chose and more people feel their ballot matters. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear national baselines for secure, auditable elections, uniform recount triggers, and rules that bind electors to the certified results. That keeps the country\u2019s regional balance in the mix while lowering the temperature and making the process feel fair, predictable, and hard to game.",
    "706": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every vote feel like it carries real weight, not just the ones cast in a few swing states. The strongest common ground I see is moving away from winner-take-all\u2014either through proportional electors or the National Popular Vote compact\u2014paired with clear national standards for ballots, audits, and recounts so people can trust the result. That approach respects the role of states and quieter regions while pulling the outcome closer to the will of the voters overall.",
    "15": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and trusted enough that families can accept the result even when their side loses. I\u2019m not convinced we need to scrap the Electoral College overnight, but we should end the winner\u2011take\u2011all distortion by moving states toward proportional or district-based elector allocation, paired with clear national baselines for voter roll accuracy, audits, and recounts. That would make more votes matter in every state while still keeping candidates accountable to smaller communities and the country\u2019s wide-open places, not just the biggest media markets.",
    "645": "I want a presidential election where every vote carries the same weight and people don\u2019t feel written off just because they live in a \u201csafe\u201d state, but I also understand the worry that a pure winner\u2011take\u2011all system can make smaller communities feel invisible. A practical bridge is moving toward the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear national standards for voting access, paper\u2011trail audits, and transparent recount rules so trust goes up no matter who wins. If we focus on fairness, simplicity, and confidence in the count\u2014not partisan advantage\u2014we can modernize the system in a way that makes more people feel heard and willing to accept the result.",
    "673": "I want a presidential election that feels as straightforward and fair as counting heads: every vote should carry the same weight, and the outcome should match what people actually chose, not quirks of a map. At the same time, I don\u2019t want smaller or rural communities written off, so I\u2019m drawn to a practical bridge like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional electors, paired with ranked-choice voting so winners earn broader support. Whatever we do, we need clear, consistent nationwide standards for ballot access, paper trails, audits, and recounts, because trust is the habitat democracy needs to thrive.",
    "237": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College outright, but I do think we should fix the winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions that leave most voters in \u201csafe\u201d states feeling sidelined and put too much power in a few battlegrounds. A practical middle ground is proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors in every state, paired with clear nationwide baselines for voter verification, paper-backed audits, and recount rules so the outcome is transparent and trusted. That preserves the role of states and regional voices while making results track voter intent more closely and reducing the sense that the system is rigged.",
    "136": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every vote matter instead of putting the whole focus on a handful of swing states. A practical compromise is to keep the state-run setup but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional elector allocation (or a district method with real anti-gerrymandering rules), and pair it with clear national standards for voter rolls, audits, and recount triggers so people trust the count. If the country can\u2019t agree on a full national popular vote yet, steps like that move us closer to \u201cone person, one vote\u201d without making smaller communities feel written off.",
    "722": "I want a presidential election where every vote feels like it truly counts, not just in a handful of swing states, while still giving smaller communities confidence they won\u2019t be brushed aside. A practical bridge is to move toward the national popular vote through the interstate compact or, at minimum, end winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts so the results are simple to understand and hard to dispute. If we keep the focus on fairness, transparency, and trust instead of partisan advantage, we can modernize the system without making any part of the country feel invisible.",
    "459": "I want a presidential election where every ballot carries equal weight and people in \u201csafe\u201d states don\u2019t feel written out of the outcome, while still respecting the real differences between regions and the role states play in running elections. A practical bridge is moving toward the National Popular Vote approach\u2014or at least ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation\u2014paired with clear national baselines for voting access, paper-audited counts, and automatic recount rules in close races. If reforms are transparent and hard to game, they can honor both majority rule and the need for every community to feel seen, which is essential for trust and participation.",
    "656": "I\u2019m cautious about scrapping the Electoral College outright, because I don\u2019t want presidential campaigns to chase only big population centers and forget smaller communities, but it\u2019s also hard to defend a system where millions of votes can feel irrelevant in \u201csafe\u201d states. A workable bridge is to keep the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all through proportional or district-based elector allocation, paired with clear, uniform national standards for verification, paper trails, audits, and recounts so the outcome is both fair and trusted. If the goal is legitimacy rather than partisan advantage, we can modernize the mechanics without losing the idea that the whole country\u2014not just a few swing counties\u2014should matter.",
    "87": "I want a presidential election that people can explain simply and accept as legitimate, because when the rules feel like a trick, trust in the whole system erodes. To me the best bridge is moving toward the national popular vote\u2014ideally through the National Popular Vote compact\u2014while pairing it with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the count is both fair and secure. If that full step isn\u2019t possible yet, ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally in each state would make more votes matter without making smaller communities feel written off.",
    "580": "I want a presidential election where every ballot carries equal weight and the winner reflects the will of the country, but I also take seriously the fear that smaller communities could be written off if campaigns only chase big population centers. A practical bridge is to move toward the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014or, at minimum, end winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally\u2014paired with clear national standards for voting access, paper-based audits, and automatic recount rules in close races. If we design reforms around transparency, consistency, and broad legitimacy instead of partisan advantage, we can lower the temperature and make it easier for people to accept the outcome even when they\u2019re disappointed.",
    "426": "I\u2019m hesitant to scrap the Electoral College outright because I don\u2019t want presidential campaigns to turn into pure big\u2011metro math, but I also think it\u2019s hard to defend a system where millions of votes in \u201csafe\u201d states feel like they don\u2019t matter. A fair, workable middle ground is to keep the state-based structure while ending winner\u2011take\u2011all\u2014either through proportional allocation or a district method paired with nonpartisan maps\u2014so results track voters more closely without erasing regional voices. Whatever route we take should come with clear, uniform baseline rules for ballot handling, audits, and recounts so the outcome is straightforward to verify and easier to accept even when your candidate loses.",
    "467": "I\u2019m cautious about scrapping the Electoral College outright because I don\u2019t want presidential campaigns to chase only big-city margins and forget smaller communities, but it\u2019s also hard to defend a system that can feel like some votes matter more than others. A reasonable middle step is to keep the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional or district-based elector allocation, paired with clear, uniform rules for secure voting, audits, and recounts so people can trust the result. If we focus on fairness, transparency, and stability\u2014not partisan advantage\u2014we can reduce the \u201cswing state\u201d problem and make outcomes easier for most Americans to accept.",
    "663": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College outright, because I believe our election system should keep candidates listening to smaller communities and not just running up margins in the biggest metros, but it also shouldn\u2019t leave most families feeling like their votes don\u2019t matter. A workable compromise is to keep the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally or by district, paired with clear nationwide standards for voter-roll accuracy, audits, and recounts so results are trusted. If we can agree on fairness and integrity\u2014no games, no confusion\u2014we can honor both the voice of the people and the role of the states.",
    "60": "I want a presidential election where the simplest truth holds up: if you earn more votes, you win, because people lose faith when their ballot feels discounted or when a few swing areas get all the attention. At the same time, I don\u2019t want reforms that make smaller states and rural communities feel written off, so I\u2019d back a practical path like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional elector allocation, paired with clear national standards for secure counting, audits, and automatic recounts in tight races. If we keep the focus on transparency and fairness rather than partisan advantage, we can get to a system that\u2019s easier to trust even when the outcome stings.",
    "379": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College outright, because I don\u2019t want presidential campaigns to write off smaller towns and whole regions, but I also get the frustration when the winner-take-all setup makes a lot of votes feel pointless. A practical fix is to keep the state-based system while requiring proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with clear national standards for clean voter rolls, secure ballots, and transparent audits so the result is easy to verify. If the rules are simple, consistent, and hard to game, more people can accept the outcome even when their side loses.",
    "71": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and leaves people confident the winner reflects the will of the voters, not quirks of geography or procedure. The best bridge to me is moving toward a national popular vote\u2014ideally through a phased approach like the National Popular Vote compact\u2014paired with uniform, auditable standards for ballot access, counting, and automatic recounts in close races. If full replacement isn\u2019t workable yet, ending winner-take-all by shifting to proportional allocation within states would make more votes matter while keeping a meaningful role for states and smaller communities.",
    "503": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make the presidency reflect the national popular will more consistently, because it\u2019s hard to defend a system where a voter\u2019s influence varies so much by state, yet I don\u2019t want changes that leave smaller communities feeling written off. A practical bridge is moving toward the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount rules so outcomes are both fair and verifiable. If we can focus on equal weight for voters and confidence in the process\u2014not partisan advantage\u2014we can modernize the system while keeping the country\u2019s regional diversity meaningfully in view.",
    "380": "I want a presidential election system that feels as fair and transparent as possible, because trust is the foundation for everything else, and it\u2019s hard to justify a setup where a handful of swing states matter more than the rest of us. The most workable bridge to me is moving toward a national popular vote\u2014ideally through a phased approach like the interstate compact\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, paper-based auditing, and recounts so the outcome is both simple to understand and hard to dispute. If we can\u2019t get there soon, ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors would still make more votes count while easing fears that any one region gets ignored.",
    "564": "I want a presidential election system that people can explain simply, trust even when their side loses, and feel is fair no matter what state they live in\u2014because when people believe their voice doesn\u2019t matter, they disengage. I\u2019m drawn to moving toward a national popular vote, but I think it needs guardrails that respect regional concerns: uniform standards for ballot access and counting, transparent audits and recount rules, and a change like ranked-choice voting or proportional allocation as a step that reduces winner-take-all distortions. If we focus on equal vote weight and shared confidence in the process, we can modernize the system without making smaller communities feel written off.",
    "652": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make the presidency reflect the national popular will more directly, because it\u2019s hard to sustain trust when the same number of ballots can carry different weight depending on the state. At the same time, I take seriously the concern that campaigns shouldn\u2019t write off smaller or rural communities, so I\u2019d favor a practical transition\u2014like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts. The goal should be a system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and stable enough that people can accept the outcome even when their candidate loses.",
    "376": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every ballot feel equally consequential, since legitimacy is the one \u201cinventory\u201d democracy can\u2019t afford to run out of. The cleanest destination is a national popular vote, but I\u2019d accept a practical bridge like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform baseline standards for access, audits, and recounts so close elections don\u2019t spiral into chaos. To address the real fear of big metros drowning out smaller communities, I\u2019d also support ranked-choice voting so candidates have incentives to build broader, cross-regional coalitions instead of just chasing narrow margins in a few battlegrounds.",
    "446": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College, because I don\u2019t want a president picked by running up totals in a few big-city pockets while the rest of the country gets ignored, but I also understand the frustration when the popular vote and the result don\u2019t line up. A common-sense fix is to keep the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all by awarding electors by district or proportionally, and pairing that with clear, uniform rules for voter rolls, ID, audits, and recounts so people trust the count. If we aim for a system that\u2019s simple, secure, and gives more Americans a reason to believe their vote mattered, we can lower the temperature without tipping the scales for either side.",
    "178": "I want a presidential election system where every ballot carries the same weight and most voters aren\u2019t treated like bystanders just because they live outside a handful of swing states. The most workable path is to move toward a national popular vote\u2014through the interstate compact if that\u2019s what it takes\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts so the result is both fair and trusted. To address worries about big regions dominating, I\u2019d also support reforms like ranked-choice voting and ending winner-take-all rules in the meantime, so candidates have to earn broader, cross-regional support.",
    "497": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College outright, because I value a system that encourages candidates to pay attention to smaller states and local communities, not just run up totals in a few big metro areas. But it\u2019s also hard to defend winner-take-all rules that leave many voters feeling sidelined, so I\u2019d support moving states toward proportional or district-based elector allocation, paired with clear, uniform standards for voter rolls, audits, and recounts so the process is both fair and trusted. If we keep the focus on transparency and broad participation rather than partisan advantage, we can modernize the system without losing the federal balance that helps hold the country together.",
    "340": "I\u2019m cautious about scrapping the Electoral College outright because I want a president who has to earn support across the country, not just run up margins in a few population centers, but I also think it\u2019s hard to justify a system where the winner can routinely diverge from the national popular vote. A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all through proportional (or district-based) elector allocation, paired with clear nationwide baselines for voter verification, paper trails, audits, and recount rules so people trust the outcome. If reforms are phased in with simple, transparent rules, we can make more voters feel like their ballots matter without turning every close election into chaos.",
    "112": "I want a presidential election system where every lawful vote carries equal weight and the outcome is easy to explain, verify, and accept\u2014even when my side loses\u2014because legitimacy is mission-critical. I can also respect the concern that a few population centers shouldn\u2019t drown out smaller communities, which is why I\u2019d start by ending winner-take-all through proportional or district-based elector allocation and pairing it with clear national baselines for ballot access, audits, and recounts. If that proves stable and trusted, moving to a national popular vote (ideally with ranked-choice voting) feels like a natural next step that rewards broad, cross-regional support.",
    "687": "I want a presidential election system where every vote carries the same weight and people in \u201csafe\u201d states don\u2019t feel written off, but I also understand the worry that smaller communities could be ignored if the rules change too fast.

If that full step isn\u2019t achievable yet, ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally would still make results match voters more closely while cooling the sense that the system is rigged.",
    "173": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every vote feel like it counts\u2014because trust and participation matter, especially when we\u2019re teaching the next generation what fair rules look like. Moving toward the national popular vote through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, or at least ending winner\u2011take\u2011all with proportional electors, seems like a practical way to better match outcomes to voters while still respecting states\u2019 roles. Whatever route we take, it should come with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so people in big cities and small towns alike can accept the results even when their side loses.",
    "137": "I\u2019m not eager to blow up a system that\u2019s kept elections predictable, but it\u2019s hard to defend rules that make millions of people feel like their votes don\u2019t count just because of where they live. The most workable middle ground to me is ending winner-take-all by moving to proportional electors (or a carefully designed national popular-vote compact), paired with clear nationwide baselines for ballot security, audits, and recounts so the result is straightforward and trusted. That way, candidates still have to earn support across the map, and everyday voters aren\u2019t left thinking the process is all quirks and no fairness.",
    "547": "I respect the Electoral College\u2019s role in making candidates earn support across the country, but I also think it\u2019s hard to defend a system where a lot of voters feel sidelined because of winner-take-all rules. Rather than abolish it overnight, I\u2019d start by requiring states to award electors proportionally or by district using fair maps, and pair that with clear, uniform standards for secure ballots, clean voter rolls, and transparent audits so the results are easier to trust. The point isn\u2019t to tilt the field for either side\u2014it\u2019s to make the outcome track the voters more closely while keeping smaller communities from being treated like an afterthought.",
    "23": "I want a presidential election where every ballot has equal weight and where the winner is clearly the one most voters chose, but I also take seriously the fear that less-populated regions get ignored when politics becomes a pure turnout-and-media game. The most workable bridge to me is ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation or the National Popular Vote compact, paired with uniform, auditable election standards and automatic recount rules so the process stays trusted and stable.

If we focus on transparency, consistency, and broad legitimacy instead of partisan advantage, we can modernize the system while keeping faith that every community\u2019s voice matters.",
    "241": "I\u2019m drawn to reforms that make the presidency track the national popular will more closely so no one feels their vote matters less based on their ZIP code, while still taking seriously the fear that smaller communities will be overlooked. A practical bridge is ending winner-take-all through proportional electors (or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the result is easy to verify and harder to fight over. If we also add ranked-choice voting, winners would better reflect broad support and campaigns would have incentives to engage more of the country instead of a few battlegrounds.",
    "703": "I want a presidential election where every vote carries the same weight and people in \u201csafe\u201d places don\u2019t feel written off, but I also take seriously the worry that a few dense areas could dominate if the rules aren\u2019t designed well. The most practical path looks like moving toward the national popular vote through the interstate compact, paired with uniform, auditable standards for ballots, recounts, and paper-trail verification so the result is easy to trust. If that full step isn\u2019t reachable yet, ending winner-take-all and requiring proportional allocation of electors would make outcomes track voters more closely while keeping the state-based framework.",
    "307": "I\u2019m not eager to scrap the Electoral College outright, because the system should still force presidential candidates to earn support across a wide map, not just run up margins in a few population centers. But I can\u2019t ignore how winner-take-all rules and uneven state procedures leave too many voters feeling sidelined and fuel doubts about legitimacy. A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework while moving toward proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with clear, uniform standards for secure voting, audits, and recounts so the outcome is easier to verify and accept. That would make results track voter intent more closely without turning every election into a single national recount.",
    "180": "I want a presidential election where every vote carries the same weight and most people can plainly see that the winner is the one the country actually chose, not the one who best worked the map. The most practical bridge, to me, is moving toward a national popular vote through the interstate compact while pairing it with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, paper trails, audits, and automatic recount rules so trust doesn\u2019t depend on which side wins. At the same time, I take seriously the fear of smaller and rural communities being ignored, so I\u2019d support reforms like ranked-choice voting and ending winner-take-all incentives that push campaigns to compete in more places and speak to more everyday concerns."
