The cleanest direction is a national popular vote, but I think it should come with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so trust doesn\u2019t depend on your zip code. If that\u2019s not attainable soon, ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation (or a well-designed interstate compact) seems like a practical step that keeps states involved while better matching the country\u2019s actual vote.",
    "510": "I want a presidential election where every vote carries the same weight and people don\u2019t feel like the outcome is decided by a handful of swing states, so I\u2019m drawn to moving toward a national popular vote\u2014ideally through a workable transition like the National Popular Vote compact. At the same time, I respect the concern that smaller communities shouldn\u2019t be ignored, which is why I\u2019d pair any change with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts, and consider ranked-choice voting to reward broader coalition-building. To me, the best reform is the one that\u2019s simple to explain, hard to game, and leaves more Americans confident the winner actually earned it.",
    "230": "I want a presidential election where the winner matches the will of voters nationwide, but I also respect the need for clear, stable rules that keep every region feeling like it matters. The most workable bridge to me is ending winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional elector allocation (or the National Popular Vote compact), paired with uniform standards for secure counting, audits, and automatic recount thresholds so the results are trusted. If we make the process more consistent and less gameable, campaigns will have a reason to compete everywhere\u2014not just in a few battlegrounds\u2014and more people will feel their vote truly counts.",

    "796": "I\u2019m not looking to blow up the system, but I also can\u2019t ignore how winner-take-all makes a lot of folks feel like their vote doesn\u2019t count unless they live in the \u201cright\u201d states. A good fix is keeping the Electoral College but pushing states to split electors proportionally (or by district with fair map rules) and locking in simple, consistent standards for secure ID options, clean audits, and recounts so the rules are clear and the results are trusted. That way smaller communities don\u2019t get steamrolled, big cities don\u2019t get painted as the enemy, and candidates have a reason to show up and listen everywhere.",

The common-ground fix I can get behind is keeping the basic framework while encouraging proportional (or district-based) allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering rules, locking in electors to follow the voters, and setting clear, uniform standards for recounts and transparent audits.

A workable compromise is keeping the state-based framework while ending winner-take-all through proportional or district-based allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering rules, plus clear national baselines for secure, auditable counting and predictable recount triggers.

    "187": "I\u2019m not eager to blow up the Electoral College, but it\u2019s hard to defend a system where a few swing states get all the attention and a lot of people feel like their vote doesn\u2019t really matter. The best middle ground to me is keeping the state-based framework while pushing states to move away from winner-take-all\u2014either proportional allocation or a fair district method with strong anti-gerrymandering rules\u2014and locking in clear, consistent standards for recounts, audits, and basic election security so the results are easier to trust. If we can agree that every region should matter and every ballot should be counted the same way, we can modernize the process without turning it into a partisan power grab.",
    "106": "I don\u2019t want to throw out a system that helps keep the whole country in the conversation, but it\u2019s hard to defend rules that make millions of votes feel pointless and turn the election into a handful of battlegrounds. The best middle ground is to keep the Electoral College while ending winner-take-all in the states through proportional or district-based allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering protections, and to lock in clear national standards for secure ballots, audits, and recounts so the results are trusted. That way the winner reflects broader support, smaller communities aren\u2019t ignored, and the rules are simple and steady enough for people to accept\u2014even when their side loses.",
    "593": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every vote feel worth casting no matter what state you live in. The clearest destination is aligning the outcome with the national popular vote, but I\u2019m open to a practical transition\u2014like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with consistent nationwide standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts. That keeps the federal structure and regional concerns on the table while reducing winner-take-all distortions and the over-focus on a few swing states. If we design the rules for transparency and trust instead of partisan advantage, it gets a lot easier for people to accept results even when their side loses.",
    "222": "I\u2019m persuaded that legitimacy is strongest when the candidate with the most votes nationwide prevails, but any reform needs clear, uniform \u201cdue process\u201d for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts so we don\u2019t turn every close election into protracted litigation. A practical bridge is to move toward the national popular vote through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact while phasing out winner\u2011take\u2011all with proportional allocation of electors, which makes more voters matter in more states without erasing the states\u2019 administrative role. If we pair that with transparent guardrails and incentives for broad, cross\u2011regional campaigning, we can respect federalism concerns while honoring the basic principle that each vote should carry equal weight.",
    "290": "I want a presidential election that feels as legible and honest as a well-lit gallery: every ballot carrying the same weight, and the final picture matching what the public actually chose. The clearest path is to move toward a national popular vote\u2014ideally through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with uniform standards for access, audits, and automatic recounts so the count is trusted in every state. For those who value federal balance, a workable bridge is ending winner-take-all by encouraging proportional allocation of electors as a transitional step, so campaigns have reason to listen beyond a few battlegrounds.",
    "311": "I want a presidential election that feels fair and easy to explain, where people in every state believe their vote truly matters and the rules don\u2019t shift for partisan advantage. Rather than jump straight to tearing everything down, I\u2019d start by ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation (or a carefully written popular-vote compact) and locking in clear national standards for counting, audits, and recounts so close races are handled the same way everywhere. That keeps the stabilizing role states play while making outcomes track the voters more closely and giving candidates a reason to listen beyond a handful of battlegrounds."
