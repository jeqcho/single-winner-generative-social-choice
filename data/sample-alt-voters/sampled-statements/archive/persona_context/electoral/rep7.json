I\u2019m open to moving toward a national popular vote, but only with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts so people trust the result even when their side loses. If that\u2019s not politically doable yet, a strong compromise is ending winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally, so candidates have to earn support across more communities and more voters feel seen.",
    "171": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every vote feel like it matters\u2014because when people don\u2019t trust the process, it spills into everything else in our lives. I lean toward aligning the outcome with the national popular vote, but I\u2019m open to pragmatic steps like the National Popular Vote compact or proportional allocation of electors if they come with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. The point isn\u2019t to advantage one side; it\u2019s to reduce the \u201cswing state\u201d obsession while still pushing candidates to build broad support across regions.",
    "409": "I\u2019m not interested in ripping out the Electoral College overnight, but I do think it needs to stop turning most states into spectators and a few battlegrounds into the whole election. A workable compromise is to keep the state-based structure while ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional or district-based allocation, and locking in simple, uniform rules for audits and recounts so people can trust the result even when it\u2019s close. That would push candidates to earn support in more places\u2014small towns, suburbs, and cities\u2014without making anyone feel like their community gets erased.",
    "217": "I want a presidential election where every vote matters the same and campaigns can\u2019t just game a few swing states, but I also get why smaller and rural communities don\u2019t want to be treated like an afterthought. The most workable bridge to me is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional elector allocation (or moving toward a national popular vote through a durable compact), paired with clear national standards for counting, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. However we change it, the goal should be a simple, transparent process that people can trust even when their side loses.",
    "686": "I\u2019m not looking to rip out the Electoral College just to say we did something, but I do think the winner\u2011take\u2011all setup leaves too many folks feeling ignored and makes a few swing states far too powerful. A sensible middle ground is to keep the state-based structure while requiring proportional (or district-based) elector allocation, locking in rules against faithless electors, and setting clear national standards for counting, audits, and recounts so the outcome is easier to trust. That way we protect the voice of smaller communities without pretending millions of votes in \u201csafe\u201d states don\u2019t matter.",
    "703": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every vote feel like it matters, not just the ones in a few swing states. The cleanest end goal is a national popular vote, but I can also get behind a practical transition\u2014like proportional allocation of electors or a popular-vote compact\u2014paired with uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts so the results are trusted. The point isn\u2019t to help one side; it\u2019s to reward broad coalitions and give every community a real reason to participate.",

That combination respects state administration and regional concerns while improving fairness and trust, so the winner can credibly claim broad, nationwide support.",
    "494": "I want a presidential election system people can explain at the kitchen table and trust, and right now it feels like too much power gets concentrated in a handful of swing states. Instead of scrapping the Electoral College overnight, I\u2019d start by ending winner-take-all and requiring states to award electors proportionally (or by district) with firm rules against faithless electors, plus clear nationwide standards for audits and recounts so close results don\u2019t spiral into suspicion. That keeps the states\u2019 role and protects smaller communities from being ignored, while making more votes matter and giving the winner a stronger, cleaner mandate.",
    "496": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, feels fair to families in every state, and makes it clear that every ballot matters\u2014not just the ones cast in a handful of swing places. The best direction is to align the outcome with the national popular vote, but I\u2019d pair that with reforms that build broad, cross\u2011regional support (like ranked-choice voting) and clear, uniform standards for ballot access, auditing, and automatic recounts so people can trust close results. If a full shift isn\u2019t feasible right away, ending winner\u2011take\u2011all through proportional allocation is a practical step that keeps states involved while reducing the sense that most voters are spectators.",
    "547": "I\u2019m not convinced we should scrap the Electoral College outright, but it needs reform so presidential races aren\u2019t decided by a handful of swing states while voters elsewhere feel sidelined. A sensible middle ground is to keep the state-based framework but require proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, lock in rules that prevent faithless electors, and adopt clear, consistent national standards for audits and recounts so the outcome is easier to trust. That way we preserve the idea that smaller communities still matter, while making results track the people\u2019s vote more closely and lowering the temperature after close elections.",

The best path, to me, is moving toward the national popular vote\u2014ideally through the National Popular Vote compact\u2014paired with uniform, transparent standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the results are trusted even in close years. If that\u2019s not politically reachable yet, at minimum we should end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally so the outcome tracks voters more closely without making smaller communities feel ignored.",

The cleanest destination is a national popular vote, but I can meet people halfway by starting with proportional electoral votes in every state and firm rules that bind electors to the results. Alongside that, we should adopt clear, consistent national standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts in close races so the process is transparent enough that even the losing side can trust it.",
    "765": "I want a presidential election system that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every voter feel like their ballot matters no matter what state they live in, because legitimacy is the foundation for everything else we ask government to do. The common thread I keep coming back to is that people want both fairness and regional respect, so I\u2019d move toward a national popular vote through a durable interstate compact, paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, auditing, and recounts. If that\u2019s not achievable right away, ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors would be a practical step that reduces swing-state obsession and encourages broader coalition-building.",
    "608": "I\u2019m not looking to blow up the Electoral College, but I do want a system where regular people don\u2019t feel like their vote only matters if they live in a swing state, and where the rules are simple enough that families and business owners can trust the outcome and move on. The most workable middle ground to me is ending winner-take-all by requiring states to allocate electors proportionally (or by district with clear guardrails), while also setting basic nationwide standards for audits, recount triggers, and ballot handling. That keeps states involved and smaller communities from being ignored, but makes the result track what voters actually chose and lowers the temperature after close elections.",
    "331": "I want a presidential election outcome that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and trusted even by the side that loses, because legitimacy is its own kind of national security. The cleanest direction is to align the result with the national popular vote, but I\u2019d take an incremental path\u2014ending winner-take-all through proportional electors or the National Popular Vote compact, paired with uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts. Like composing a painting, the goal is balance: make every vote matter while keeping candidates accountable to communities everywhere, not just a few swing states or the biggest media markets.",

If that shift isn\u2019t realistic yet, I\u2019d still push states to end winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally so campaigns have to listen to more communities and fewer people feel written off.",

That keeps the focus on broad coalition-building and public trust, while easing the fear that smaller and rural communities will be treated like an afterthought.",
    "574": "I\u2019m not eager to rip out the Electoral College, because I do think presidents should have to win support across the map, not just run up numbers in a few major metros. But the winner\u2011take\u2011all setup and the swing\u2011state obsession leave too many voters feeling sidelined, so I\u2019d favor a practical reform like proportional or district-based allocation of electors, along with clear, uniform rules for ballot handling, audits, and recounts so people can trust the count. That kind of step keeps states in the process while making outcomes track voter intent more closely and lowering the temperature after close elections.",
    "405": "I\u2019m not convinced we should scrap the Electoral College outright, but I do think the winner\u2011take\u2011all approach in most states makes too many voters feel irrelevant and turns the whole race into a handful of battlegrounds.

The clearest destination is aligning the outcome with the national popular vote, but if that\u2019s a heavy lift, I\u2019d start by ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors and adding uniform national standards for audits, recounts, and ballot handling. That way we honor the role states play while making campaigns compete in more places and giving every community\u2014rural, urban, and in-between\u2014a real stake in the result.",

A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College while requiring states to allocate electors proportionally (or by district with clear guardrails), combined with uniform national standards for ballot handling, audits, and automatic recount triggers so the outcome is easy to verify and accept.

    "605": "I\u2019ve come to believe the healthiest reform is one that makes every ballot matter while lowering the sense that the whole country hangs on a few swing-state counties. I\u2019d support moving toward a national popular vote\u2014likely through an interstate compact\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts, and ideally ranked-choice voting so winners earn broad support. If that\u2019s too much change at once, ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors is a sensible step that still respects the role of states. What I can\u2019t accept is a system that invites suspicion and strategic neglect of most communities when the goal should be legitimacy, transparency, and a president who has to listen widely.",

The most durable path seems to be aligning the outcome with the national popular vote\u2014whether through an interstate compact or by ending winner-take-all with proportional electors\u2014paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts. I also take seriously the worry that smaller and rural communities could be ignored, which is why I\u2019d add reforms like ranked-choice voting to reward broad, cross-regional coalitions instead of narrow, divisive strategies. If we focus on fairness, transparency, and legitimacy rather than partisan advantage, we can modernize the system in a way people will accept even when their side loses.",
    "158": "I want a presidential election where the winner is the person most voters choose, and where nobody feels like their vote is \u201cextra\u201d or \u201cignored\u201d just because they live in a non\u2011swing state. The best path to me is moving toward the national popular vote\u2014through the National Popular Vote compact or, at minimum, ending winner\u2011take\u2011all with proportional electors\u2014paired with clear, uniform rules for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the process is simple and trusted. I also get the worry about smaller communities being drowned out, which is why I\u2019d support reforms like ranked-choice voting that reward broad, cross\u2011regional coalitions instead of razor\u2011thin victories. If the rules feel fair and easy to explain, it\u2019s a lot harder for people to doubt the outcome, and a lot easier to get back to solving everyday problems.",
    "49": "I\u2019m drawn to a presidential election that feels fair and easy to explain\u2014where your vote matters whether you\u2019re in a deep-blue city or a deep-red small town, not just in a couple \u201cpurple\u201d states. The cleanest path is moving toward a national popular vote through something like the National Popular Vote compact, and I\u2019d pair it with ranked-choice voting plus clear, consistent standards for counting, audits, and recounts so people trust the result. If that\u2019s not politically doable yet, I can live with proportional elector allocation as a step away from winner-take-all, because it spreads attention and respect across more communities.",
    "299": "I want a presidential election that\u2019s easy to explain, hard to game, and makes every vote feel like it carries real weight\u2014because when people don\u2019t trust the count, it spills into everything else. The cleanest direction is to align the outcome with the national popular vote, but I\u2019d pair that with ranked-choice voting and clear, uniform standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so the winner has broad support and the process feels steady in every state. If that step feels too big right now, we should at least end winner-take-all by moving states to proportional electors and locking down rules against faithless electors, so campaigns have a reason to listen beyond a handful of swing states."
