    "554": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, privacy, and solid medical evidence, with decisions centered on the patient and their doctor\u2014not politicians\u2014especially when health, rape, or severe fetal complications are involved. I can respect the moral weight many people place on potential life, which is why I support clear, workable standards that prioritize safety and informed consent instead of punishment. The most real common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place through honest sex education, affordable contraception, and stronger prenatal, mental health, and family supports so fewer people feel cornered either way.",
    "147": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion, privacy, and medical evidence, recognizing that pregnancy decisions are time-sensitive and deeply personal, and that politicians can\u2019t anticipate every family\u2019s reality. I can respect the moral seriousness many people attach to potential life while still believing the safest, fairest approach keeps decisions primarily between a patient and qualified clinicians, with clear protections for health, rape or incest, and severe fetal conditions. Common ground is investing hard in what prevents crisis\u2014accurate sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and real support for parents\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into an impossible choice.",
    "418": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, privacy, and medical reality, keeping time-sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians rather than politicians. At the same time, I can respect the moral weight many people attach to potential life, which is why I support clear, workable health-and-safety standards and unambiguous exceptions when health, severe fetal complications, or violence are involved. The most durable common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and real support for prenatal care, mental health, and families\u2014so fewer people are ever forced into an impossible choice.",
    "808": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by respect for life, personal responsibility, and plain, workable rules that don\u2019t leave doctors and families guessing in an emergency. I can support clear limits, with firm exceptions when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at risk and for the most traumatic situations, while putting more effort into preventing crisis pregnancies through honest education, access to contraception, and real support for prenatal care and adoption. If we keep the focus on compassion instead of punishment, we can protect the vulnerable and still recognize that some cases are painful and complicated.",
    "138": "I believe abortion laws should treat unborn life with real moral seriousness while also protecting women in emergencies and other truly heartbreaking situations, with rules written clearly enough that doctors can act without fear or delay. The best common ground is reducing the number of abortions by preventing crisis pregnancies through straightforward education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, adoption, and postpartum support so choosing to carry a pregnancy is a real option. If we keep politics out of the exam room but don\u2019t pretend the choice is trivial, we can build policy that\u2019s compassionate, practical, and accountable.",
    "70": "Laws on abortion should treat unborn life with moral seriousness while also recognizing that pregnancies can bring medical emergencies and heartbreaking circumstances that no legislature can script from afar. I favor clear, workable limits paired with plainly written exceptions to protect a woman\u2019s life and serious health, and I don\u2019t want families or doctors threatened with criminal penalties when time-sensitive care is needed. The most durable common ground is to prevent crisis pregnancies in the first place\u2014through responsible education, accessible contraception, strong prenatal care, and real support for parenting and adoption\u2014so fewer people ever face this choice.",
    "671": "I think abortion laws should be guided by compassion, privacy, and medical reality\u2014keeping politicians out of the exam room\u2014while still taking seriously that many people see potential life as morally meaningful. Common ground looks like protecting safe, timely access especially in emergencies or severe fetal complications, and putting real effort into prevention and support: honest sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and help that makes parenting or adoption a realistic option. The goal should be fewer crisis pregnancies and less suffering, without criminalizing patients or doctors or forcing one set of beliefs onto everyone.",
    "167": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, privacy, and clear medical judgment\u2014because real life is messy, emergencies are real, and politicians can\u2019t write a rule for every family\u2019s crisis. At the same time, I can respect the moral seriousness many people feel about potential life, which is why I support practical steps that prevent unintended pregnancy and make carrying to term more doable: honest education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal and family supports. If we keep the government out of the exam room while investing in prevention and care, we can lower the temperature and reduce suffering without turning personal tragedy into a court case.",
    "23": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a strong respect for privacy\u2014keeping urgent, complex decisions in the exam room with patients and qualified clinicians, not in criminal courtrooms. I can take seriously the moral weight many place on developing life while still believing the baseline must protect a person\u2019s health, safety, and ability to make a timely decision, with clear exceptions for medical risk, nonviability, and circumstances like rape or incest. The most durable common ground is pairing any legal framework with prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families who choose to carry to term.",
    "241": "I\u2019m guided by a desire to reduce suffering and treat pregnancy decisions with moral seriousness and humility, which means keeping time-sensitive medical care centered on the patient and clinician rather than politics, especially when health, safety, or severe fetal conditions are involved. At the same time, I hear the shared hope for fewer abortions, and I think the most durable path there is prevention and support: honest education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real economic and mental health resources so no one feels forced by circumstance. Laws should set clear, workable guardrails that protect safety and informed consent without criminalizing people in crisis. If we lead with compassion and practical outcomes, there\u2019s room to honor both conscience and autonomy while strengthening families and communities.",
    "471": "Abortion laws should reflect both a respect for developing life and a clear commitment to compassion and safety for the person who is pregnant, with decisions grounded in medical reality rather than political slogans. I support reasonable, clearly written limits that still include straightforward exceptions for rape, incest, life-threatening or serious health risks, and cases where the fetus is not viable, so families and clinicians aren\u2019t frozen by fear or ambiguity. The most durable common ground is putting real effort into prevention and support\u2014access to contraception and accurate education, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for parenting and adoption\u2014so fewer people ever reach a crisis point.",
    "205": "I see this as a serious, personal decision where compassion and real-life responsibility matter more than politics, and I don\u2019t think the law should turn families or doctors into criminals when health, safety, or heartbreaking complications are on the line. Common ground, to me, is keeping medical decisions private and timely while also working hard on prevention and support\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, and prenatal and family help\u2014so fewer people ever feel trapped. If the goal is less suffering and stronger families, the rules should be clear, humane, and focused on helping people rather than shaming them.",
    "136": "I don\u2019t want politicians making one-size-fits-all calls about a situation that can turn into a medical emergency or a family crisis overnight, so the law should keep decisions as close to the patient and doctor as possible, with clear protections for life, health, and privacy. At the same time, I can respect the moral weight people place on unborn life, which is why I\u2019d rather put real effort into prevention and support\u2014straightforward education, affordable contraception, and practical help for parents and adoption\u2014so fewer families ever reach that point. If we focus on reducing harm and expanding real options instead of punishing people in tough moments, we can lower the temperature and write rules most folks can live with.",
    "640": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a respect for privacy\u2014keeping time\u2011sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians rather than politicians\u2014while taking seriously that many people see real moral value in potential life. Common ground is pairing clear, workable health-and-safety standards and firm protections for emergencies with major investments that prevent crisis pregnancies and support families: reliable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for parents who choose to carry to term. If we focus on reducing harm and expanding real options instead of punishment and slogans, we can lower the number of tragedies and keep communities from tearing each other apart.",
    "521": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a respect for privacy\u2014keeping the hardest decisions as close as possible to the patient and qualified clinicians, not politics. I can also recognize the moral weight many people place on developing life, which is why I support clear, workable protections for medical emergencies and severe fetal conditions, paired with real efforts to prevent unintended pregnancies through honest education and affordable contraception. If we want fewer tragedies and fewer abortions, we should put more energy into supporting families\u2014prenatal and postpartum care, mental health support, and practical help\u2014so no one is forced into a decision by fear, money, or lack of options.",
    "358": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a respect for personal conscience\u2014keeping politicians out of time\u2011sensitive decisions best made by a patient and qualified clinicians, especially when health, trauma, or fetal nonviability are involved. At the same time, it\u2019s reasonable to acknowledge the moral weight many attach to potential life by focusing public policy on what measurably reduces abortions: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real economic and childcare supports. If the goal is fewer tragedies and healthier families, the law should prioritize safety, clarity for medical providers, and practical support over punishment or one\u2011size\u2011fits\u2011all mandates.",
    "723": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, privacy, and solid medical evidence, keeping time-sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and their clinicians while ensuring clear, workable exceptions when health, safety, or severe fetal complications are involved. I can respect the deep moral weight many attach to potential life, which is why I also want policy to put real effort into preventing unintended pregnancies through accurate education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, postpartum, and mental-health support. If the goal is fewer crises and less suffering, we should stop using punishment and politics in the exam room and instead expand the practical resources that help people choose freely and responsibly.",
    "69": "I believe abortion law should start with a real respect for unborn life, but it also has to be clear, workable, and humane enough that doctors can act fast when a woman\u2019s life or serious health is on the line, and when pregnancy comes from violence. If we want fewer abortions, the surest path is prevention and support\u2014responsible education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal care, and real help for mothers and adoption\u2014so people aren\u2019t cornered by fear or finances. We won\u2019t all draw the line in the same place, but we can agree the law shouldn\u2019t criminalize families in crisis, and it should protect both human dignity and common-sense medical judgment.",
    "458": "Abortion laws should treat unborn life with real moral seriousness while also facing the hard medical and personal realities that don\u2019t fit tidy rules, so the priority should be clear, workable standards that protect a woman\u2019s life and health and don\u2019t turn families or doctors into criminals in a crisis. The most durable common ground is pairing reasonable limits and informed consent with practical prevention\u2014straight talk, responsible contraception access, and strong prenatal and adoption support\u2014so fewer people end up at this decision in the first place. If we focus on compassion, responsibility, and keeping politics from overriding medical judgment, we can lower the temperature and actually reduce both harm and heartbreak.",
    "753": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, privacy, and solid medical evidence, with decisions kept between a patient and their doctor\u2014especially when health, safety, or severe fetal complications are on the line\u2014because one-size-fits-all rules don\u2019t match real life. At the same time, I can respect the moral weight many people feel about potential life, so I want the law to put real effort into prevention and support: affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help so no one feels cornered. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing crisis pregnancies and protecting dignity, we can cool the temperature and take better care of our communities.",
    "275": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, privacy, and solid medical evidence, because pregnancy decisions can turn on time-sensitive health realities and family circumstances that don\u2019t fit neat political rules. I can respect the moral seriousness many people feel about potential life while still believing the safest, fairest approach keeps decisions primarily with the pregnant person and qualified clinicians, with clear exceptions when health, rape, incest, or nonviability are involved. If we want fewer abortions and less suffering, we\u2019ll get farther by investing in prevention and support\u2014reliable sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and mental health care, and real help for parents\u2014than by criminalizing people in crisis.",
    "250": "I want abortion laws to be written like reliable system requirements: protect patient safety and privacy, keep time\u2011sensitive medical decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians, and include clear, workable exceptions when health, rape/incest, or severe fetal conditions are involved. At the same time, it\u2019s reasonable to treat potential life with moral seriousness, so I support reasonable, evidence-based guardrails paired with the proven \u201cupstream fixes\u201d that reduce abortions\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal/postpartum care, and practical support for families who choose to carry to term. If we focus less on punishment and more on prevention, clarity, and real options, more people can agree even when their convictions differ.",
    "225": "I\u2019m guided by a belief in human dignity and compassion, which makes me wary of one-size-fits-all laws that pull politicians into private, time-sensitive medical decisions and can deepen hardship for families already under stress. At the same time, I take seriously the moral weight many attach to potential life, so I want policy that emphasizes prevention\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, mental health, and parenting supports\u2014so fewer people ever face a crisis pregnancy. If we can protect timely care and clear health exceptions while investing in real resources that make choosing parenthood genuinely possible, we can lower suffering and lower abortions without turning neighbors into enemies.",
    "764": "I see abortion like tending a garden: you protect what\u2019s growing, but you also have to deal with storms and emergencies with steady, practical care instead of politics. Laws should respect unborn life with clear, reasonable limits, yet make straightforward exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health risks, rape or incest, and severe fetal problems so doctors aren\u2019t forced to wait while someone suffers. The common ground is preventing as many crisis pregnancies as possible through honest education, access to contraception, and real support for prenatal care, adoption, and parents\u2014so fewer people feel cornered and more families can choose life without fear.",
    "335": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a respect for privacy\u2014keeping the hardest decisions as close as possible to the patient and qualified clinicians, not politicians. I can also understand the moral weight many people place on potential life, which is why I support clear, workable rules that protect health and safety, include explicit exceptions for medical emergencies and severe fetal conditions, and avoid criminalizing families in crisis. If we want fewer abortions and stronger families, the most practical common ground is investing in prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and real help for parents\u2014so people have genuine options instead of forced ones.",
    "197": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, evidence-based medicine, and a respect for personal conscience\u2014keeping politicians out of time-sensitive healthcare decisions while setting clear, workable standards that protect patient safety and allow prompt care when health, rape/incest, or severe fetal complications are involved. I can take seriously the moral weight people attach to potential life and still believe the most humane way to reduce abortions is prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, mental health services, and real help for families who choose to parent or pursue adoption. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing harm and expanding real options, we can protect dignity on all sides and lower the number of crisis pregnancies.",
    "699": "I start from the belief that unborn life deserves serious moral weight, but I\u2019m also convinced laws have to be clear enough for doctors to act quickly and compassionate enough not to turn medical crises or trauma into courtroom battles. A workable approach sets reasonable limits with well-defined exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health risks, rape or incest, and nonviable pregnancies, while pairing that with real support\u2014prenatal care, adoption services, and practical help for families\u2014so choosing to carry a pregnancy is truly possible. If we put prevention and stability at the center through responsible education and contraception access, we can reduce abortions without treating people in painful situations as political targets.",
    "661": "Abortion law should start with a real respect for unborn life, but it also has to be clear, medically grounded, and compassionate enough that doctors can act quickly in emergencies and families aren\u2019t turned into criminals in the worst moments of their lives. I can support reasonable limits that include firm exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to a mother\u2019s life or health, while putting more effort into prevention\u2014honest education, access to contraception, and strong prenatal and postpartum support. If we focus less on scoring points and more on reducing crisis pregnancies and supporting parents who choose to carry to term, we can protect dignity on both sides and lower the number of abortions in a way that\u2019s actually workable.",
    "410": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for personal autonomy, keeping time-sensitive decisions between patients and qualified clinicians while treating the moral weight many people feel about potential life with seriousness rather than slogans. The most durable common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal and parenting supports, so choices aren\u2019t driven by fear, coercion, or lack of resources. And when health, safety, rape, or severe fetal complications are involved, the law should be clear enough that doctors can act quickly without families being turned into criminal cases.",
    "789": "I believe abortion law should start with a real respect for unborn life, but it also has to be written clearly and humanely enough that doctors can act without hesitation when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is on the line, and families aren\u2019t treated like criminals in a crisis. The best common ground I see is pairing reasonable limits and plain-language medical exceptions with practical supports that actually reduce abortions\u2014reliable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and adoption services\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered. If we can argue less like it\u2019s a courtroom and more like neighbors trying to do right, we can protect dignity on all sides and lower the number of tragedies.",
    "794": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a respect for families\u2019 real-life circumstances, keeping time-sensitive decisions primarily between a patient and qualified clinicians rather than politicians. I can hold the moral seriousness many people feel about potential life while still insisting on clear exceptions for threats to health, nonviable pregnancies, and situations involving violence, written plainly enough that care isn\u2019t delayed by fear or confusion. If the shared goal is fewer tragedies and fewer abortions, the most practical path is prevention and support: comprehensive education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, postpartum, and parenting resources so no one is forced into a decision by panic, poverty, or lack of care.",
    "151": "I believe laws on abortion should start with a serious respect for unborn life, while also being honest that pregnancies can involve medical emergencies, violence, and heartbreaking complications where quick, clear exceptions are needed so doctors can protect a mother\u2019s life and health. If we want fewer abortions and less suffering, the law can\u2019t just punish; it should also strengthen prevention and real support\u2014accurate education, access to contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families and adoption. I can\u2019t support a system that leaves families alone in crisis or turns private tragedy into a courtroom fight, and I think we can lower the temperature by combining firm moral boundaries with compassion, clarity, and real resources.",
    "798": "I want abortion laws grounded in compassion and sound medical evidence, with enough privacy and flexibility that patients and clinicians\u2014not politicians\u2014can respond to real-life emergencies, severe fetal conditions, and situations involving violence or serious health risk. At the same time, I can respect the moral gravity many attach to potential life, which is why I support reasonable, clearly written guardrails alongside strong prevention: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and practical support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing crisis pregnancies and protecting health and dignity, there\u2019s room for a durable agreement even among people who disagree deeply.",
    "258": "I want laws on abortion to be guided by compassion, privacy, and real medical evidence, because pregnancy decisions can be time-sensitive and life-changing, and politicians can\u2019t predict every family\u2019s situation. I also hear the moral seriousness many people feel about potential life, so I think the most practical common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies with honest education, affordable contraception, and strong support for prenatal care, childcare, and mental health. The law should keep care safe and accessible\u2014especially early on and in cases involving health risks or severe fetal complications\u2014without criminalizing people who are already trying to survive and do what\u2019s best for their families.",
    "28": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, privacy, and medical evidence, because real pregnancies don\u2019t follow a scripted lesson plan and families need room to make time-sensitive decisions with qualified clinicians. At the same time, I take seriously that many people feel a moral duty to protect potential life, so any framework should put prevention and support at the center\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and mental health care, and practical help for parents\u2014so fewer people ever face a crisis. The common ground I see is keeping the government out of the exam room while building a stronger safety net that makes every option more real, safer, and less driven by fear or finances.",
    "787": "I\u2019m guided by a belief that life is precious and that the law should reflect that, but it also has to be clear, workable, and compassionate in the hardest cases\u2014especially when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is on the line, or when the pregnancy comes from violence. I can support reasonable limits that protect unborn children while making sure doctors can act without fear in emergencies and families aren\u2019t turned into criminals in moments of crisis. The surest common ground is doing more to prevent unintended pregnancies and to back up families who choose to carry to term with real prenatal care, adoption support, and practical help. If we keep the focus on responsibility, mercy, and fewer tragedies instead of politics, we can write laws more people can live with.",
    "180": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, privacy, and solid medical reality\u2014keeping urgent decisions between a patient and qualified clinicians, with clear protections when health, safety, or severe fetal complications are involved. At the same time, I can respect the moral weight many people feel around potential life, which is why I want the focus to be on preventing crisis pregnancies through honest education, affordable contraception, and real support that makes parenting feasible. If we put resources into healthier families and keep politics out of the exam room, we can lower the temperature and reduce harm no matter where someone starts on the issue.",
    "321": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, clear medical standards, and personal responsibility\u2014keeping urgent decisions in the hands of patients and doctors, especially when a life or serious health risk is involved, while setting reasonable, workable guardrails that people can actually understand and follow. If we want fewer abortions and less suffering, we should put more effort into prevention and stability: affordable contraception, accurate information, and real support for prenatal care, adoption, and families who choose to carry a pregnancy. I can respect the moral concern for unborn life and still believe we shouldn\u2019t turn private, time\u2011sensitive medical situations into criminal cases that punish people in crisis. A policy that is practical, consistent, and focused on reducing harm is where I think most people can meet.",
    "522": "I\u2019ve learned that pregnancy care is rarely simple, and laws work best when they keep urgent medical decisions between patients and qualified clinicians, protect privacy, and ensure clear exceptions when health, severe fetal complications, or trauma are involved. At the same time, I take seriously why many people feel a moral responsibility to protect potential life, which is why I want policy to focus hard on preventing crisis pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and real support for parents who choose to carry to term. If we center compassion over punishment and invest in the safety net, we can reduce harm, lower unintended pregnancies, and respect conscience without turning families\u2019 hardest moments into political battles.",
    "484": "I\u2019m for keeping abortion decisions mostly between a patient and their doctor, because real life gets messy fast and politicians can\u2019t write one rule that fits every medical situation or family crisis. At the same time, I hear the people who feel a real moral duty to protect potential life, so I\u2019d rather put serious energy into the stuff that actually prevents abortion\u2014solid sex ed, affordable birth control, and real support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption. If we keep the law focused on safety, privacy, and clear medical exceptions, and back it up with practical help, we can lower the harm and the heat at the same time.",

If we focus less on scoring points and more on prevention, compassion, and workable rules, we can protect people\u2019s dignity even when we don\u2019t agree on where the line is.",
    "432": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for privacy\u2014keeping urgent decisions between a patient and qualified clinicians, with clear protections for health and safety and no criminalization of people in crisis. At the same time, I understand why many see potential life as morally serious, so I can support practical guardrails that are workable in real hospitals and paired with strong prevention and family supports like comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and help for parents raising kids with disabilities. If the goal is fewer tragedies and fewer unwanted pregnancies, we\u2019ll get farther by expanding real options and support than by forcing one-size-fits-all rules that ignore the messy realities families live with.",

    "760": "I\u2019m persuaded that abortion law works best when it treats pregnancy decisions as time-sensitive medical care\u2014protecting privacy, clear clinician judgment, and real exceptions for health, violence, and severe fetal conditions\u2014rather than turning hard cases into criminal investigations. At the same time, I can respect the moral seriousness many attach to potential life, which is why I want policy to put as much energy into preventing crisis pregnancies as into regulating outcomes: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and prenatal, mental-health, and parenting supports. The common ground, to me, is fewer people feeling cornered, fewer late emergencies caused by delay, and laws written plainly enough that patients and doctors can act safely and humanely.",

Common ground, to me, is pairing clear, workable guardrails and informed-consent standards with serious investment in prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical resources that make carrying a pregnancy and raising a child a real option. If we focus less on punishment and more on measurable reductions in harm and unintended pregnancies, we can protect dignity and health without treating anyone\u2019s crisis like a political test case.",

At the same time, I can respect the moral gravity many attach to unborn life by putting real effort into upstream fixes: accurate education, easy access to contraception, and practical support for pregnancy, adoption, and parenting so fewer families ever reach a crisis point. If we treat this like a real-world system design problem\u2014minimize harm, avoid one-size-fits-all mandates, and build in support\u2014we can protect both conscience and freedom without turning private tragedies into criminal cases.",
    "777": "I want abortion laws to keep medical decisions private and grounded in evidence, with clear protections for a person\u2019s health and timely care so families and clinicians aren\u2019t forced to wait until a situation turns into an emergency. At the same time, I can respect that many people feel a real moral weight about potential life, which is why I support practical steps that reduce unintended pregnancies\u2014honest sex education, affordable contraception, and real prenatal, postpartum, and childcare support.

If we invest in prevention and in helping families who choose to continue a pregnancy, we can lower abortions without criminalizing people who are already scared and overwhelmed.",
    "264": "I want laws on abortion that keep government out of the exam room and trust patients and doctors to handle time\u2011sensitive, complicated realities with privacy, safety, and compassion\u2014especially when health, trauma, or severe fetal conditions are involved. At the same time, I can respect the moral weight many people feel about potential life, which is why I\u2019d pair legal access with serious prevention and support: accurate sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for parents and adoption. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing crisis pregnancies and suffering, we can protect dignity while lowering the number of situations that lead families to this decision."
