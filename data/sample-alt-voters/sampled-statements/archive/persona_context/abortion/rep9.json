    "111": "I believe laws on abortion should be guided by a serious respect for human life, paired with the humility to recognize that pregnancies can involve medical emergencies and tragic circumstances where clear, workable exceptions are necessary. The most durable policy is one that sets consistent limits, keeps decisions grounded in sound medicine rather than politics, and refuses to treat women in crisis like criminals. If we\u2019re serious about reducing abortions, we should put as much energy into prevention and support\u2014accurate information, access to healthcare, and real help for parenting or adoption\u2014as we do into arguing about where to draw the line.",
    "185": "I want abortion laws that keep decisions grounded in medical reality and personal dignity, with early access protected and clear, workable exceptions later when health, safety, or severe complications are on the line\u2014because politicians shouldn\u2019t be the ones delaying care in a crisis. At the same time, if we\u2019re serious about valuing life, we have to invest in what actually prevents desperate choices: affordable contraception, honest sex education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real support like childcare and paid leave. The common ground for me is fewer people being cornered by money, fear, or lack of options, and more families having the stability to make the best decision they can.",
    "375": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, personal freedom, and medical reality, with the aim of keeping people safe instead of turning a crisis into a courtroom fight. I can respect the moral weight many place on potential life while still believing decisions should stay as close as possible to the person, their family, and their doctor\u2014especially early on and in cases of serious health risks, rape, or nonviable pregnancies. The strongest common ground is preventing desperation in the first place: honest education, affordable contraception, and real support for pregnancy, childbirth, and raising kids so choices aren\u2019t driven by fear or money.",
    "368": "I want abortion laws grounded in medical reality and privacy, with decisions kept as close as possible to the patient and their clinician, while still treating pregnancy and potential life with the seriousness many people feel. The most durable common ground, to me, is pairing early, safe access and clear exceptions for health emergencies and traumatic circumstances with practical investments that prevent crisis\u2014affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real support for parents. If we focus less on punishment and more on consistency, dignity, and fewer people feeling cornered, we can lower the temperature and actually reduce harm.",
    "328": "To me, laws on abortion should start with respect for human life and personal responsibility, but they also have to face the hard medical realities that can hit a family without warning, so clear exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats matter. I can support reasonable limits that reflect the seriousness of ending a pregnancy, as long as the rules are medically workable and don\u2019t turn doctors and families in crisis into criminals. The best common ground is putting real effort into prevention and support\u2014honest education, access to contraception, strong prenatal care, and adoption and family resources\u2014so fewer people ever get pushed to that point.",
    "766": "I want abortion laws that keep real-life medical decisions safe, timely, and private, while still treating the choice with moral seriousness and compassion rather than punishment. To me, common ground is focusing on what actually reduces abortions and suffering: accurate sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical support so money or instability doesn\u2019t make the decision for someone. And whatever limits exist later in pregnancy, they should be medically grounded with clear exceptions so doctors can act quickly when health or viability is on the line.",
    "606": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and personal freedom, while still acknowledging that many people see potential life as morally significant and don\u2019t want the decision treated casually. To me, the most durable approach protects safe, timely access\u2014especially early in pregnancy\u2014with clear, workable exceptions later for health and severe complications, and keeps politicians from substituting their judgment for patients and clinicians. Common ground is investing hard in what prevents crisis in the first place: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and real prenatal, postpartum, and childcare support so choices are genuine, not forced by fear or finances.",
    "300": "I believe abortion laws should start with respect for human life and the seriousness of ending a pregnancy, while also staying grounded in medical reality so women can get timely care in emergencies and the hardest cases. The most humane approach is clear limits with well-defined health exceptions, paired with practical support\u2014prenatal care, honest counseling, adoption help, and real assistance for parents\u2014so fewer people feel cornered by money, fear, or lack of options. If we focus less on punishment and more on prevention and support, we can lower the temperature and protect both conscience and compassion.",
    "178": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a sober respect for the moral gravity many people feel about potential life, without turning private crises into criminal cases. I want decisions kept as close as possible to patients and clinicians\u2014especially early in pregnancy and in emergencies\u2014paired with clear, workable standards later on that protect health and avoid political interference. If we\u2019re serious about reducing abortions and suffering, we should put as much energy into prevention and support\u2014contraception, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families and adoption\u2014as we do into arguing about limits.",
    "487": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal conscience, because pregnancy can sit right at the intersection of health, faith, finances, and family stability. The best common ground I see is protecting safe, timely care\u2014especially early in pregnancy and in emergencies\u2014while setting clear, workable standards later on that doctors can follow without fear. Just as important, we should invest in what actually reduces crisis pregnancies: honest education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real help with childcare and basic needs so fewer families feel cornered into an impossible decision.",
    "760": "Abortion law should be guided by a harm-reduction mindset that respects bodily autonomy and medical reality while acknowledging that many people see genuine moral weight in potential life. I want clear, medically grounded rules that keep politicians and criminal penalties out of time-sensitive healthcare, protect privacy, and preserve access early in pregnancy with workable health exceptions later. Common ground is treating this as a prevention-and-support issue: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real economic supports so fewer people feel cornered into any decision.",
    "550": "I see abortion as a morally serious decision because there\u2019s potential life involved, but I also know real life gets messy fast and rigid rules can put families and doctors in impossible spots. Laws should set clear, workable limits while guaranteeing straightforward exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and they should avoid criminalizing people who are already in crisis. If we\u2019re serious about fewer abortions, the best \u201cget-it-done\u201d approach is prevention and support\u2014honest education, access to contraception, solid prenatal care, and adoption and family resources\u2014so more people have a real chance to choose stability and responsibility.",
    "249": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal freedom, with decisions kept as close as possible to patients and clinicians instead of politicians. At the same time, I don\u2019t think the moral weight of potential life should be brushed aside, which is why I can support clear, medically grounded limits later in pregnancy alongside strong, explicit protections for emergencies and severe complications. The most honest common ground is investing hard in prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and economic stability\u2014so fewer people ever face this choice and more families can actually thrive.",
    "262": "I believe laws on abortion should be guided by respect for life and a clear sense of responsibility, while also leaving room for compassion when pregnancies involve danger, violence, or heartbreaking medical realities. Good policy should be clear enough for doctors and families to follow, avoid treating people in crisis like criminals, and put real support on the table\u2014prenatal care, honest counseling, adoption options, and help for parents\u2014so fewer families ever feel cornered into this decision. If we focus on prevention and strengthening families instead of politics and punishment, we can protect dignity and reduce harm even when we don\u2019t agree on every moral line.",
    "378": "I start from the belief that unborn life matters, but I also don\u2019t want laws written like a slogan when real families are facing medical emergencies, trauma, or situations they never imagined. The best approach is clear, workable limits with firm exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and compassionate consideration for cases like rape or incest, so doctors can act without hesitation and families aren\u2019t treated like criminals. If we\u2019re serious about fewer abortions, we should put as much effort into prevention and support\u2014accurate information, access to contraception, prenatal care, and adoption and parenting resources\u2014as we do into arguing about punishment.",
    "5": "I want abortion laws to be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal conscience\u2014because these decisions are serious, time-sensitive, and often tangled up with health, safety, and finances. The government should keep care safe and private, with clear protections and exceptions so patients and doctors aren\u2019t forced to wait until things get dangerous, while also investing hard in what actually reduces abortions: honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and real support for parents and adoption. If we focus less on punishment and more on prevention and stability, we can honor the value people place on life without trapping families in crisis.",
    "139": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for conscience\u2014keeping decisions as close as possible to patients and their doctors, not politicians\u2014while acknowledging that many people feel a genuine moral responsibility toward developing life. The most durable common ground, in my view, is protecting safe, timely care with clear health exceptions and pairing it with serious investments that prevent crisis pregnancies in the first place: honest education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical support for parents and adoption. If we focus less on punishment and more on dignity and real-world help, we can lower the temperature and reduce suffering no matter where someone draws the moral line.",
    "432": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion and medical reality, keeping urgent decisions between a patient and qualified clinicians while recognizing that many people feel a real moral responsibility to protect developing life. I can support access early in pregnancy with clear, medically grounded exceptions later\u2014especially for health risks, fatal fetal conditions, and situations involving violence\u2014so nobody is forced into danger or delay. The most durable common ground is putting real resources behind prevention and family stability: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, disability-inclusive supports, and paid leave so fewer families ever feel cornered into this choice.",
    "228": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a serious respect for human life and personal responsibility, while still leaving clear, workable room for medical emergencies and the hardest cases so doctors aren\u2019t forced to hesitate when time matters. I\u2019m drawn to policies that set consistent limits, avoid criminalizing women in crisis, and put real support behind the idea of choosing life\u2014affordable prenatal care, counseling, adoption that works, and practical help for families. If we focus on prevention and stability\u2014honest education, access to contraception, and stronger support for parents\u2014we can reduce abortions and lower the temperature without treating neighbors like enemies.",
    "3": "I\u2019ve come to believe abortion laws should be guided by reverence for life and by humility about how messy real medical and family situations can get, so the focus stays on reducing harm rather than handing out punishment. The common ground, to my mind, is clear and workable medical exceptions, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical support\u2014healthcare, counseling, contraception, and adoption services\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into this choice. Like tending a piece of land, you set firm guardrails, but you also show up with steady care when storms hit.",
    "692": "I hold that laws should start with a real respect for human life and the seriousness of ending a pregnancy, but they also have to be written with mercy and medical common sense so women can get timely care in emergencies and truly tragic situations. The best way to lower the temperature is to pair clear, reasonable limits with real, practical help\u2014good prenatal and postpartum care, honest counseling, adoption support, and community resources\u2014so fewer people feel cornered in the first place. If we focus less on punishment and more on prevention, responsibility, and supporting mothers and babies after birth, we can protect dignity and reduce abortions without turning neighbors into enemies.",
    "567": "Abortion law should be guided by a commitment to reduce harm in the real world: protect privacy and medically sound care, keep clinicians able to act quickly in emergencies, and avoid turning people in crisis into criminals. I can hold space for the moral weight many attach to potential life while still believing the state shouldn\u2019t force a one-size-fits-all decision, especially early in pregnancy and in cases involving serious health risks, fatal fetal conditions, rape, or incest. The most durable common ground is pairing access with prevention and support\u2014reliable contraception and education, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families\u2014so fewer people ever reach this crossroads.",
    "201": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, privacy, and solid medical judgment, because real pregnancies can turn complicated fast and politicians aren\u2019t the ones in the exam room. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many people feel about potential life, which is why I\u2019m drawn to protecting early access, ensuring clear health exceptions later, and keeping the rules straightforward enough that doctors can act without delay. The best common ground I see is putting far more effort into prevention and support\u2014affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real help for parents\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into this decision.",
    "548": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a sober respect for the moral weight many people attach to potential life, with decisions kept as close as possible to patients, families, and clinicians\u2014not politicians. I can support protected access early in pregnancy and clear, workable exceptions later for serious health threats, nonviable pregnancies, and cases of violence, because rigid rules tend to create preventable suffering and dangerous delays. If the shared goal is fewer abortions and healthier families, the most honest path is pairing any legal framework with evidence-based prevention\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real economic support for parents.",
    "173": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for families trying to make the most responsible decision they can in a hard moment, without politicians turning it into punishment or shame. Since children thrive when adults have stability and support, the best common ground is preventing crises first\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and real help with childcare and basic needs. At the same time, the law should protect timely, safe care and clear medical exceptions so doctors can act quickly when health or safety is on the line. If we keep dignity and practical support at the center, we can reduce suffering and lower the number of unwanted pregnancies without treating neighbors like enemies.",
    "6": "I believe laws on abortion should start with a real respect for human life and personal responsibility, while also being honest about the medical emergencies and heartbreaking complications that can hit real families without warning. The law should set clear, workable limits with well-defined exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and it should avoid turning patients or clinicians into criminals for time-sensitive medical decisions. If we want fewer abortions, we\u2019ll get farther by investing in prevention and support\u2014accurate information, access to contraception, strong prenatal care, and adoption and community resources\u2014so choosing life is a realistic option, not just a legal slogan.",
    "478": "I want abortion laws guided less by ideology and more by humility, compassion, and medical reality\u2014protecting a person\u2019s ability to get safe, timely care, especially when health is at stake, while acknowledging the moral weight many feel about potential life. The best common ground I\u2019ve seen is to prevent crises in the first place with honest education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, postpartum, and family supports so choosing to carry a pregnancy isn\u2019t made impossible by money or lack of care. And whatever limits exist later in pregnancy, they should be clear, evidence-based, and written so doctors can act without fear and families aren\u2019t treated like criminals.",
    "113": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for personal conscience, with decisions kept as close as possible to patients and clinicians rather than politicians. I also take seriously that many people see potential life as morally significant, which is why I support clear, workable standards later in pregnancy with strong exceptions for health emergencies, fatal fetal conditions, and cases of violence. The most durable common ground is pairing any legal framework with real prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and childcare\u2014so fewer families are pushed into crisis choices in the first place.",
    "391": "I see abortion as a serious, morally weighty decision where the law should protect unborn life as much as possible, but it also has to be clear, medically grounded, and allow fast exceptions when a mother\u2019s life or severe health risks are on the line, and in truly tragic cases like rape or incest. What makes sense to me is shifting more energy toward prevention and support\u2014straight talk about responsibility, access to prenatal care, and adoption and parenting resources\u2014so fewer people feel trapped into the worst choice. If we can agree on fewer abortions, safer moms, and healthier kids, we can write rules that don\u2019t punish people in crisis and don\u2019t ignore the value of life either.",
    "749": "I want abortion laws to be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a real respect for the moral weight many people feel\u2014without turning private healthcare decisions into criminal ones. The most workable approach is protecting safe access early in pregnancy, ensuring clear exceptions when health is at risk or circumstances are extreme, and writing rules that let clinicians act quickly and consistently. At the same time, we should invest far more in what actually reduces abortions and hardship\u2014reliable contraception, honest sex education, maternal healthcare, and practical support for parents\u2014so more pregnancies are wanted and more families are stable. If we focus on prevention, dignity, and real options instead of punishment and slogans, there\u2019s room for common ground even amid deep disagreement.",
    "486": "I come back to the idea that both the unborn and the person carrying the pregnancy deserve dignity, and that laws should be shaped less by punishment and more by real support when families are scared, stretched thin, or facing medical complications. I can live with clear, medically grounded limits that include firm exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, because real emergencies don\u2019t wait on politics. The best common ground is preventing crisis in the first place\u2014honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, adoption support that works, and practical help like childcare and stable resources\u2014so choosing life is truly possible and fewer people feel cornered.",
    "460": "I want abortion laws that keep people safe and decisions in the hands of patients and doctors, while still treating pregnancy and potential life with real seriousness instead of using it as a political weapon. To me, common ground looks like protecting early access and clear medical exceptions when health or trauma is involved, paired with real support\u2014affordable healthcare, contraception, honest education, and help with childcare and leave\u2014so fewer families feel trapped. If we focus on prevention, privacy, and practical support for parents and kids, we can lower the number of abortions without punishing people in crisis.",
    "600": "I want abortion laws guided by dignity, medical reality, and compassion\u2014keeping urgent decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians rather than politicians\u2014while still acknowledging why many people feel a deep moral responsibility to protect potential life. Common ground, to me, is making abortion safe and accessible early, ensuring clear exceptions when health or safety is at risk, and refusing to criminalize people in crisis. If we\u2019re serious about fewer abortions, we should invest in what actually prevents them and supports families: comprehensive education, affordable contraception, prenatal and mental health care, and a real safety net so no one is forced into a decision by poverty or lack of options.",
    "9": "I believe laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal conscience, because families can be doing everything right and still face a scary, complicated pregnancy. I don\u2019t want politicians in the exam room; I want clear rules that protect a person\u2019s health and safety, with real exceptions for emergencies and heartbreaking cases, and no criminal punishment for patients or doctors. If we\u2019re serious about valuing life, then we also have to make it easier to raise children\u2014affordable healthcare, contraception, prenatal care, and support with childcare and paid time off\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into this decision.",
    "83": "I\u2019ve always believed the law should start with respect for unborn life, but it also has to face the hard truth that pregnancies can turn dangerous or heartbreaking, and families shouldn\u2019t be left to navigate that alone. I can live with clear limits that protect life, paired with firm exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious medical emergencies, and I\u2019d rather see our energy go into prevention and support\u2014good prenatal care, honest counseling, adoption options, and practical help for mothers. If we keep compassion at the center and stop treating this like a political weapon, we can reduce abortions and still protect dignity in the hardest cases.",
    "134": "Abortion law should be guided by reducing suffering in the real world: protecting a person\u2019s ability to make timely, private medical decisions with their doctor, while treating potential life with moral seriousness instead of political theater. I can respect why people want limits, but any limits have to be medically grounded, include clear exceptions for health emergencies and trauma, and avoid criminalizing patients or clinicians. If we want fewer abortions and healthier families, the most honest common ground is prevention and support\u2014reliable contraception and sex education, affordable prenatal and postpartum care, and real resources for anyone who chooses to carry a pregnancy to term.",
    "62": "I\u2019ve come to believe abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal conscience, because pregnancy decisions can be urgent, complicated, and deeply tied to a family\u2019s stability and health. The government\u2019s role should be to keep patients safe and care accessible\u2014especially early in pregnancy and in cases involving serious health risks or trauma\u2014while avoiding policies that criminalize people or tie doctors\u2019 hands. Common ground is investing hard in prevention and support: accurate education, affordable contraception, strong maternal healthcare, and practical help that makes it genuinely possible to carry a pregnancy to term if that\u2019s the choice.",
    "310": "I don\u2019t want politicians micromanaging a private medical decision, but I also can\u2019t pretend there isn\u2019t a real moral stake when a potential life is involved, so the law should be clear, workable, and centered on safety rather than punishment. I can live with protected access early in pregnancy and firm, medically defined exceptions later\u2014especially for threats to the mother\u2019s life and serious complications\u2014so doctors can act without fear or delay. The best common ground is putting most of our energy into fewer unintended pregnancies and fewer crisis decisions through straightforward education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal care, and real support for parenting or adoption.",
    "14": "I\u2019m wary of politicians turning a serious, personal medical decision into a one-size-fits-all mandate, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s honest to pretend there\u2019s no moral weight or potential life involved. The law should be clear and workable: protect privacy and timely care, guarantee firm exceptions for medical emergencies and other hard cases, and avoid criminalizing people in crisis or tying doctors\u2019 hands. If we want fewer abortions and less bitterness, the real common ground is prevention and support\u2014accurate information, access to contraception, and practical help for women and families so choices aren\u2019t driven by fear, money, or lack of options.",
    "366": "I think abortion laws should be guided by evidence-based medicine, patient autonomy, and compassion, with clear, workable protections so time-sensitive care isn\u2019t delayed by fear of legal consequences. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many people attach to potential life, which is why I support policies that reduce unintended pregnancies and make continuing a pregnancy more feasible through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal/postpartum care, paid leave, and childcare support. If we center safety, dignity, and real-world outcomes\u2014rather than punishment or politics\u2014we can lower the number of crises while respecting that families and clinicians need room for nuanced, medically grounded decisions.",
    "442": "I\u2019ve come to believe abortion laws ought to be guided by compassion and medical reality, with decisions kept as close as possible to the patient and doctor, not turned into a courtroom matter. At the same time, I don\u2019t brush off the moral weight people feel about potential life, so I can live with clear, medically grounded guardrails later in pregnancy and firm, workable exceptions for health emergencies and tragic circumstances. If we truly want fewer abortions, we need to quit grandstanding and put real support on the table\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and help for families\u2014because you can\u2019t ask folks to carry a load and then leave them holding the bag.",
    "604": "I\u2019m big on people taking responsibility for their choices, but I also don\u2019t trust politicians to handle time-sensitive medical decisions better than a patient and a doctor in the real world. The law should keep abortion safe and legal early on, guarantee clear exceptions for health emergencies and other hard cases, and avoid criminalizing people who are already in a crisis. If we want fewer abortions, the most practical path is prevention and support\u2014straight answers, affordable contraception, solid prenatal care, and real help for anyone who chooses to carry a pregnancy to term.",
    "792": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, privacy, and medical reality, because when families are already stretched thin, the last thing they need is politicians second-guessing time-sensitive care. At the same time, I can\u2019t ignore that many people see real moral weight in potential life, so I\u2019m open to clear, medically grounded limits later in pregnancy with firm exceptions for health emergencies, rape, and severe fetal complications. The best common ground is putting real support behind whatever the law says\u2014affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and help with childcare and adoption\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into this decision.",
    "781": "I believe abortion laws should start with a real respect for human life, but they also have to face the hard truth that pregnancies can turn into medical and personal emergencies where families need swift, compassionate care. I can support clear limits that protect unborn children, as long as there are well-defined exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and the rules are written plainly enough that doctors aren\u2019t scared to act. The best common ground I see is putting more effort into prevention and support\u2014honest counseling, prenatal care, adoption that actually works, and practical help so no one feels forced into a choice by money or being alone. If we treat this as a duty to protect both mothers and babies, not a chance to punish or shame, we\u2019ll get closer to laws people can live with.",
    "61": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for privacy, because real-life pregnancies can involve health risks, trauma, and financial stress that politicians can\u2019t predict from a distance. I can also respect that many people feel a deep moral responsibility to protect potential life, so I support a framework that keeps abortion safe and legal early on, allows clear medical exceptions later, and avoids criminalizing patients or doctors. The most durable common ground is putting serious resources into prevention and support\u2014accurate sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and real help with childcare and housing\u2014so fewer people are pushed into this decision in the first place.",
    "431": "Abortion laws should be guided by a serious respect for human life and by compassion for families facing complicated, sometimes frightening situations, with clear rules that protect unborn children while making firm medical exceptions when a mother\u2019s life or severe health is at stake and in cases of rape or incest. I want policy to focus less on punishment and more on prevention and support\u2014honest education, access to contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real help with childcare and adoption\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into a crisis. If we keep decisions anchored in medical reality, personal responsibility, and practical help for parents and kids, we can lower the number of abortions and treat people with dignity even when we disagree on where the line should be.",
    "348": "I believe laws on abortion should be guided by respect for human life and personal responsibility, while also staying grounded in medical reality and treating families in crisis with compassion rather than shame. That means clear, workable limits paired with firm exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and a refusal to criminalize patients or doctors for making time-sensitive decisions. The common ground, to me, is putting real effort into prevention and support\u2014accurate information, access to contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and adoption and family resources\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into this choice.",
    "287": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal autonomy, with decisions kept as close as possible to the patient and their doctor instead of turning a crisis into a courtroom. At the same time, I don\u2019t think it helps to pretend the moral weight is trivial, so I can support clear, evidence-based guardrails later in pregnancy that include strong exceptions for health emergencies, fatal fetal conditions, and situations involving violence.

    "734": "I\u2019m guided by the belief that life is precious, and the law ought to protect it, but it also has to deal honestly with the hard, real-world situations where a mother\u2019s health is on the line or a family is in deep crisis. Like fixing a fence line, we need clear boundaries and plain rules\u2014strong limits with well-defined medical exceptions\u2014so doctors can act quickly and people aren\u2019t treated like criminals when storms hit. And if we\u2019re serious about fewer abortions, we should put as much effort into prevention and support as we do into arguing: better prenatal care, adoption options that work, and practical help so choosing life doesn\u2019t feel like planting with no rain in the forecast.",
    "464": "I believe laws on abortion should start with a serious respect for human life, while also admitting that pregnancies can bring medical emergencies and heartbreaking situations where quick, compassionate care has to come first. The best laws set clear limits with well-defined exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and severe medical complications, and they pair those rules with practical support\u2014prenatal care, counseling, and adoption resources\u2014so fewer women feel cornered by fear or finances. If we focus less on punishment and more on responsibility, prevention, and real help for families, we can protect dignity on both sides and lower the number of abortions over time.",
