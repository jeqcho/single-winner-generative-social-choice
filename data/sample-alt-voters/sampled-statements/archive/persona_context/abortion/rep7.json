    "375": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and individual freedom\u2014keeping early decisions as much as possible between a patient and their doctor, not politicians, while recognizing the moral weight many people feel about potential life. Clear rules should protect health and allow doctors to act fast in emergencies, without turning families in crisis or clinicians into criminals. The strongest common ground is preventing unwanted pregnancies and reducing desperation by making contraception, honest education, prenatal care, and real support for parents and adoption easier to access.",
    "778": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, privacy, and medical reality\u2014written so patients and clinicians can make time-sensitive decisions safely, without fear of criminalization, especially when health or viability is at stake. At the same time, I can respect the moral seriousness many people feel here, which is why I think our best common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies through honest education, affordable contraception, and real support for prenatal care, childcare, and adoption. If we center dignity and practical help instead of punishment and politics, we can reduce suffering and give families more genuine choices.",
    "329": "I don\u2019t want politicians in the exam room, but I also think it\u2019s fair to acknowledge the moral weight people feel about potential life, so any law should be clear, medically grounded, and focused on safety rather than punishment. The best common ground is driving down unwanted pregnancies with straightforward education, easy access to contraception, and real support for prenatal care, adoption, and parenting so fewer families feel cornered. If we keep the focus on privacy, medical judgment, and practical help for kids and parents, we can lower the temperature and reduce harm even when we disagree on where the line should be.",
    "667": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, privacy, and sound medical judgment, because real pregnancies can become complicated quickly and families shouldn\u2019t have politicians in the exam room. At the same time, I respect the moral seriousness many feel about developing life, which is why I favor practical guardrails that protect health and safety and never punish patients or clinicians for acting in emergencies. The surest common ground is prevention and support: honest education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and mental-health care, and real help for parents so fewer people are pushed into desperate decisions.",
    "337": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, privacy, and solid medical evidence, because real pregnancies can turn complicated fast and politicians shouldn\u2019t be second\u2011guessing patients and doctors. At the same time, I take seriously that many people see potential life as morally significant, so I can support clear, workable guardrails tied to medical reality and broad exceptions for health, safety, and severe fetal complications\u2014without criminalizing patients or clinicians. The best common ground is reducing the number of crisis pregnancies in the first place with honest education, affordable contraception, and real support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption so people have options instead of ultimatums.",
    "307": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a serious respect for human life and by clear, workable standards that don\u2019t leave families or doctors guessing in urgent, real-world situations. I can support reasonable limits paired with narrowly defined exceptions for rape, incest, and threats to the mother\u2019s life or severe health, written precisely so they protect patients without turning medical judgment into a courtroom fight. The best common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place\u2014through responsible education, access to contraception, and strong prenatal, adoption, and family supports\u2014so fewer people ever face this decision.",
    "438": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, privacy, and medical reality, trusting patients and clinicians to navigate decisions that are often time-sensitive and morally heavy without politicians standing in the exam room. I can respect the impulse to protect potential life, but I\u2019m persuaded that the most effective\u2014and humane\u2014common ground is prevention and support: accurate education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for parents so fewer people ever feel cornered. \u201cThe truth is rarely pure and never simple,\u201d and our laws should reflect that complexity by protecting health and dignity while avoiding punishment and stigma.",
    "448": "Laws concerning abortion should start with respect for human life and the moral seriousness of the decision, while also recognizing that real pregnancies can involve medical emergencies, tragedy, and fear that don\u2019t fit tidy political categories. I want clear, workable limits with narrowly defined health and life exceptions that let doctors act quickly without turning families in crisis into criminal cases. The best common ground is making abortion less common by investing in what prevents crisis pregnancies and supports choosing life\u2014responsible education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, adoption, and practical help for parents.",
    "419": "Abortion law should start with a serious respect for human life while also recognizing that real pregnancies can involve urgent medical complications and heartbreaking circumstances that don\u2019t fit slogans. I support clear, workable limits paired with precisely written exceptions for life-threatening and severe health situations so clinicians can act without delay or fear, and so families aren\u2019t pushed into danger. The most durable common ground is prevention and support: make contraception and accurate education easy to access, strengthen prenatal and postpartum care, and expand adoption and practical help so fewer people feel cornered into this decision.",
    "800": "I believe abortion law has to start with respect for human life and personal responsibility, but it also has to leave room for medical reality and the hard situations families face without turning patients or doctors into criminals. The best common ground is clear, workable limits with well-defined exceptions for life-threatening and severe health circumstances, paired with real support that makes choosing birth more realistic\u2014prenatal care, adoption resources, and help for parents. If we put more effort into prevention through education and access to contraception, and less into punishment and politics, we can lower the number of abortions while treating people with dignity.",
    "549": "I want laws on abortion guided by compassion, medical evidence, and privacy, because these are time-sensitive decisions that belong as close as possible to the patient and clinician, not politicians. At the same time, I can respect the moral weight many people feel about potential life, which is why I support practical guardrails tied to medical reality and clear exceptions that let doctors act without fear when health is on the line. The most durable common ground is prevention and support: honest sex education, affordable contraception, and real help for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption so fewer people ever face a crisis choice.",
    "493": "I want laws on abortion to be guided by compassion, medical reality, and the privacy needed for families and doctors to make time-sensitive decisions without fear or political interference. I also hear the sincere moral concern for potential life, and I think common ground is strongest when we focus on preventing crisis pregnancies through honest education, affordable contraception, and real support for prenatal care, childcare, and paid leave. Clear protections for a patient\u2019s health and for clinicians acting in good faith should be nonnegotiable, and no one in a painful situation should be shamed or criminalized.",
    "273": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, privacy, and medical reality\u2014keeping time-sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians, not politicians\u2014while still acknowledging the genuine moral weight many people feel about developing life. The most durable common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place through honest, age-appropriate education, affordable contraception, and strong supports for parenting like prenatal care, childcare, and paid leave. Clear, workable rules should protect people in medical emergencies and avoid criminalizing patients or doctors, because fear and delay make hard situations worse.",
    "484": "I think abortion laws should be guided by compassion and real medical facts, keeping early decisions as private as possible between a patient and their doctor, without turning families or healthcare workers into criminals. At the same time, I get why folks feel a moral duty to protect potential life, so the best middle is cutting down crisis pregnancies with straight-up sex ed, affordable birth control, and real support for parenting\u2014healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. If we stay focused on safety, dignity, and fewer people feeling trapped, we can lower the heat and actually help families instead of just arguing.",
    "565": "I\u2019m guided by a real respect for unborn life, but I also can\u2019t ignore that pregnancies can go sideways fast and families sometimes face painful, complicated situations where doctors need to act without fear. The law should set clear, workable limits with firm exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious medical harm, and it shouldn\u2019t turn patients or clinicians into criminals for doing the right thing in an emergency. Common ground is doing more upstream\u2014making contraception and honest education easier to access, and backing up pregnancy and parenting with real support and adoption resources\u2014so fewer people end up at that crossroads in the first place.",
    "596": "Laws on abortion should reflect both the seriousness of ending a developing life and the reality that pregnancies can become medical and personal crises where clear, timely decisions matter. I favor clear, enforceable limits paired with precise exceptions for threats to the mother\u2019s life or serious health, written so doctors can act without fear and families aren\u2019t turned into criminal cases. The strongest common ground is prevention and support: reduce unintended pregnancies through responsible education and contraception access, and make it more realistic to carry a pregnancy through prenatal care, adoption resources, and practical help for parents.",
    "640": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a respect for privacy\u2014keeping decisions as close as possible to a patient and their doctor, especially when time and health are on the line. I also hear the sincere moral concern for potential life, and I think the most durable common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place through honest education, affordable contraception, and real support for parents like prenatal care, childcare, and paid leave. The goal should be fewer tragedies and less politics in the exam room, without criminalizing families or clinicians who are trying to do the safest, most responsible thing.",
    "599": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a little humility\u2014because hard pregnancies don\u2019t read the rulebook and neither do emergencies. I want decisions kept as close as possible to the patient and the clinician, with clear protections so nobody is criminalized for seeking or providing care, while also putting real muscle into prevention and support: contraception people can afford, straightforward education, prenatal care, and help for families who choose to carry to term. If we\u2019re serious about valuing life and dignity, we can stop using punishment as a shortcut and focus on reducing crises in the first place.",
    "325": "I think abortion laws should be guided by compassion, privacy, and medical reality, because these decisions are often made under intense pressure and shouldn\u2019t be turned into a courtroom fight for patients or doctors. At the same time, I can respect that many people see potential life as morally serious, which is why I\u2019d rather put our energy into reducing unintended pregnancies and crisis situations through honest sex education, affordable contraception, and stronger support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption. The most workable path is protecting safe, timely care\u2014especially when health is at risk\u2014while building a safety net that gives people real options instead of shame or coercion.",
    "555": "I\u2019m guided by a strong respect for unborn life, but I also don\u2019t want laws that turn heartbreaking medical situations into courtroom fights or make doctors hesitate when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is on the line. The best path is clear, workable limits with well-defined exceptions for life-threatening emergencies and the hardest cases, paired with real support that makes choosing to carry a pregnancy realistic\u2014prenatal care, adoption resources, and help for families. If we put less energy into punishment and more into prevention through responsible education and access to contraception, we can reduce abortions while treating people with dignity and compassion.",
    "453": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for conscience\u2014keeping time\u2011sensitive decisions as close as possible to the patient and clinician, not politics, while recognizing the moral weight many people feel about potential life. To my mind, the surest common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place with honest education, affordable contraception, and strong support for prenatal care, parenting, and adoption. However the lines are drawn, the law should be clear enough for providers to act quickly in emergencies and should never turn families\u2019 worst days into criminal cases.",
    "668": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a respect for personal conscience, because one-size-fits-all rules ignore how nonlinear real life can be when health, safety, and timing collide. I can take seriously the moral weight many people place on developing life while still believing decisions should stay primarily with the patient and clinician, with clear protections for emergencies and without criminalizing care. If we want fewer abortions and less suffering, the most robust \u201cupstream intervention\u201d is reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and a stronger safety net for pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting.",
    "79": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal conscience\u2014keeping decisions as close as possible to the patient and qualified clinicians, especially early in pregnancy and in emergencies, without turning private crises into criminal cases. At the same time, I want the law to put real weight behind preventing unintended pregnancies and making parenting a real option through honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and practical support like childcare and paid leave. If we focus less on punishment and more on safety, responsibility, and a strong safety net, we can reduce abortions over time while treating people with dignity even when we disagree about when life begins.",
    "105": "Laws on abortion should start with a serious respect for unborn life, but they also have to be written clearly enough that doctors can act fast in medical emergencies and families aren\u2019t turned into criminals in the middle of a crisis. I\u2019m drawn to practical, enforceable guardrails with well-defined exceptions for life-threatening situations and the hardest cases, paired with real efforts to prevent unintended pregnancies through straightforward education and easy access to contraception. If we put more energy into supporting women and families\u2014prenatal care, adoption services, and help that makes parenting doable\u2014we can reduce abortions and lower the temperature without pretending this is a simple issue.",
    "370": "I see abortion as morally serious because it involves a developing life, but I also don\u2019t think the answer is treating women in crisis or doctors in emergencies like criminals. Laws should set clear, workable limits with firm exceptions for life-threatening situations and other heartbreaking cases, and they should be paired with real prevention and support\u2014easy access to contraception, honest education, prenatal care, and adoption resources\u2014so fewer people ever get pushed to that point. If we focus less on punishment and more on responsibility and practical help, we can protect life, protect women\u2019s health, and lower the temperature on an issue that tears neighbors apart.",
    "418": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and a clear respect for personal conscience\u2014because these decisions are often made quietly, under stress, and should stay primarily between a patient and a trusted clinician, not politicians. At the same time, I can honor the sincere moral concern for potential life by focusing policy on what actually reduces crisis pregnancies: accurate education, affordable contraception, and real support for prenatal care, childbirth, and parenting. If we center safety, privacy, and practical help instead of punishment and stigma, we can lower the temperature and protect both dignity and life.",
    "345": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, privacy, and medical evidence, keeping time-sensitive decisions as close as possible to patients and clinicians, with clear protections for health and emergency care. I also think it\u2019s fair to acknowledge the moral weight many people feel about developing life, which is why I support practical, upstream steps nearly everyone can agree on\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and real support for parenting and adoption. If we focus less on punishment and more on preventing crisis pregnancies and protecting safety, we can lower the temperature and build policy that treats families with dignity even when we don\u2019t share the same beliefs.",
    "244": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, privacy, and medical evidence, with enough room for patients and clinicians to respond quickly to real-life complexity rather than fear of prosecution. I also take seriously that many people view potential life as morally weighty, which is why I can support clear, workable guardrails later in pregnancy that are tied to medical reality and always include strong health exceptions. The most durable common ground, to me, is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, and practical support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption\u2014so fewer families ever face this decision under pressure.",
    "576": "Creo que las leyes sobre el aborto deben partir de la compasi\u00f3n y de la realidad m\u00e9dica, dejando que las decisiones m\u00e1s tempranas se tomen en privado entre la persona, su familia y su doctor, sin criminalizar a pacientes ni a profesionales. A la vez, entiendo el peso moral que muchos sienten por la vida en formaci\u00f3n, por eso apoyo reglas claras para casos avanzados y excepciones firmes cuando hay riesgo serio para la salud o situaciones traum\u00e1ticas. El mejor punto de encuentro es prevenir crisis: educaci\u00f3n honesta, anticoncepci\u00f3n accesible y apoyo real para el embarazo, el parto y la crianza, porque \u201cm\u00e1s vale prevenir que lamentar.\u201d",
    "118": "I believe abortion law should start from a serious respect for unborn life, while also being honest that pregnancies can involve medical emergencies and heartbreaking circumstances where doctors need clear, workable room to act to protect a mother\u2019s life and health. The most durable common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place\u2014through responsible education, easy access to contraception, and stronger support for prenatal care, adoption, and families raising children\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered. Whatever the limits are, I don\u2019t want policies that shame women or criminalize doctors acting in good faith; I want laws that are compassionate, medically grounded, and focused on protecting the vulnerable.",
    "543": "I think abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for privacy\u2014because when you\u2019re juggling bills, relationships, and health, a one-size-fits-all rule can turn a hard situation into a dangerous one. At the same time, I understand why many people feel a real moral weight about potential life, so I\u2019d rather see policy focus on preventing crisis pregnancies through honest sex education, affordable contraception, and real support for prenatal care, childcare, and adoption. Whatever the limits are, they should be clear, evidence-based, and written so patients and doctors aren\u2019t criminalized for time-sensitive care.",
    "505": "I see abortion as a serious moral issue involving real human life, but I also don\u2019t think the law should be written so rigidly that it ties doctors\u2019 hands in emergencies or turns families in crisis into criminals. The best way to lower the number of abortions is to get practical: reduce unplanned pregnancies with responsible education and easy access to contraception, and make it more realistic to choose to carry a child through prenatal care, adoption support, and real help for moms. If we can agree on clear, workable limits with well-defined health exceptions and a strong safety net, we can protect life while treating people with dignity when life gets messy.",
    "221": "I believe laws on abortion should begin with a serious respect for unborn life, while also recognizing that pregnancies can involve medical emergencies and heartbreaking circumstances where doctors need clear authority to act quickly to protect a woman\u2019s life and health. A workable approach pairs reasonable limits and well-defined exceptions with practical commitments that actually reduce abortions\u2014reliable contraception, responsible education, prenatal care, and real support for parenting and adoption. If we keep the focus on compassion, clarity, and prevention instead of punishment and politics, we can protect dignity on all sides and lower the temperature on an issue that touches families at their most vulnerable moments.",
    "310": "I don\u2019t want politicians in the exam room making one-size-fits-all rules about a situation that can turn medical and time-sensitive fast, but I also get why people see a real moral stake when a potential life is involved. The law should protect safety, privacy, and clear medical exceptions so doctors can act without fear, while focusing upstream on what actually reduces abortions: easy access to contraception, straightforward education, and practical support for pregnancy, adoption, and parenting. If we aim for fewer crisis pregnancies and less punishment, there\u2019s room to respect both personal freedom and the value many place on unborn life.",
    "452": "I believe laws on abortion should be guided by a real respect for life, but also by mercy and medical reality, with clear exceptions so doctors can act quickly when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at risk and families aren\u2019t turned into criminals during a crisis. If we want fewer abortions, we should put as much energy into prevention and support\u2014responsible education, access to contraception, strong prenatal care, and practical help for mothers and adoption\u2014so choosing life is truly possible, not just a slogan. We may never agree on every line, but we can agree that the law should be clear, compassionate, and focused on reducing harm instead of using this issue to divide neighbors.",
    "16": "Abortion law should be guided by a harm-reduction mindset: protect patient safety and privacy, keep time-sensitive decisions in the patient\u2013clinician loop, and write any limits and exceptions with the same clarity and enforceability we expect in other high-stakes safety and compliance regimes. I can respect the moral seriousness many people attach to potential life while still believing government shouldn\u2019t substitute for medical judgment or turn families and doctors into legal targets during emergencies. The most durable common ground is upstream\u2014driving down unintended pregnancies with evidence-based education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, postpartum, childcare, and adoption supports\u2014so fewer people ever face a crisis choice.",
    "17": "I want abortion laws guided by medical reality, privacy, and compassion, because real-life health decisions are time-sensitive and don\u2019t fit clean political rules\u2014and I don\u2019t think anyone in crisis should be shamed or turned into a criminal case. At the same time, I understand why many people feel a serious moral responsibility toward potential life, which is why I\u2019d pair protected access\u2014especially early on and in health emergencies\u2014with strong efforts to prevent unwanted pregnancies through honest education, affordable contraception, and practical support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption. If we keep the focus on safety, dignity, and fewer crises instead of punishment, there\u2019s room for a framework most people can live with even when they disagree.",

At the same time, I hear the moral seriousness many attach to potential life, which is why I want the law to pair any limits with strong prevention and support: honest education, affordable contraception, mental health care, and practical help for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption.

At the same time, I take seriously the moral weight many attach to potential life, which is why I\u2019d pair legal access\u2014especially early in pregnancy\u2014with strong, practical investments that reduce unintended pregnancies and make parenting a real option: accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal/postpartum care, childcare, and paid leave. If policy is built around evidence, privacy, and compassion instead of punishment, we can lower both abortion rates and the temperature of the debate.",
