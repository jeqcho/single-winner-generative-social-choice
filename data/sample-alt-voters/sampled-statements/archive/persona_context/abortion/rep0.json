    "193": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, privacy, and medical reality, so people and clinicians can make time\u2011sensitive decisions safely without fear of punishment, while still acknowledging the moral weight many feel about potential life. The most durable path is to lower the number of abortions by investing in what actually prevents crisis\u2014affordable contraception, honest education, strong maternal healthcare, and real support for parents and children. Clear rules should protect health exceptions in practice and keep politicians from substituting ideology for medical judgment, because dignity and safety have to come first.",
    "749": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a strong respect for privacy, because hard decisions get even harder when politics replaces clinical judgment. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll all agree on when moral obligations begin, but we can agree that clear, workable health exceptions and timely, safe care should never be out of reach. If the real goal is fewer abortions and healthier families, the most effective path is prevention and support\u2014affordable contraception, accurate education, and practical help for pregnancy, birth, and childcare\u2014rather than punishment.",
    "704": "I want laws on abortion guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for privacy\u2014so time\u2011sensitive decisions stay with patients and qualified clinicians, not politicians. I can also acknowledge the genuine moral weight many people feel about developing life, which is why any limits should be clear, workable, and include real exceptions for health and devastating circumstances. The most durable common ground, to me, is investing in prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, mental\u2011health, and childcare resources\u2014so fewer people ever reach a crisis point.",
    "702": "I\u2019m guided by a safety-first mindset: laws should keep patients and clinicians clear of legal turbulence in time-sensitive, complex medical situations, while respecting the real moral weight many people feel about developing life. That means protecting privacy and timely access to care\u2014especially when health or viability is at stake\u2014without criminalizing doctors or people in crisis. The most durable common ground is reducing the need for abortion through practical prevention and support: accurate education, affordable contraception, strong maternal healthcare, and real help for anyone choosing to carry a pregnancy to term.",
    "235": "I\u2019ve come to believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion and medical reality, keeping urgent, deeply personal decisions in the hands of patients and doctors rather than politicians. At the same time, I hear the sincere desire to protect potential life, and I think the best common ground is preventing crisis in the first place with honest education, affordable contraception, and real support for pregnancy, birth, adoption, and childcare. If we can focus on dignity, privacy, and fewer desperate situations\u2014without punishment or shame\u2014we can lower conflict and real suffering.",
    "41": "I\u2019ve seen enough up close to know pregnancy can be straightforward for some people and medically or emotionally dangerous for others, so laws should be grounded in evidence, protect timely care, and keep urgent decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many feel about developing life, which is why any framework should be clear, humane, and paired with real prevention and support\u2014reliable contraception, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for parents and adoption. If we center safety, privacy, and compassion, we can lower the number of crises without turning families and clinicians into targets.",
    "651": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for privacy, because rigid, one-size-fits-all rules tend to create more suffering and push people into unsafe corners. I can hold the moral seriousness many feel about developing life while still believing the most humane approach keeps decisions with the pregnant person and their clinician, with clear protections for health and emergencies and without criminalizing patients or doctors. The most durable common ground is prevention and support: honest education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, postpartum, childcare, and adoption resources so fewer people ever face this crisis.",
    "25": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for conscience\u2014keeping urgent, time-sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians instead of politicians. I can take seriously the moral weight many people feel about developing life while still insisting on clear, workable protections for a pregnant person\u2019s health and safety, with exceptions that actually function in real emergencies. If we want fewer abortions and stronger families, the most practical common ground is preventing unintended pregnancies and backing up parenthood with real support like affordable healthcare, contraception, prenatal care, childcare, and paid leave.",
    "660": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a respect for personal conscience\u2014keeping urgent health decisions primarily between a patient and qualified clinicians, not politicians. At the same time, I hear the sincere moral concern for developing life, and I think our best common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and real support for parents like healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. If we can pair safe, timely access with practical help that makes choosing and raising a child more possible, we\u2019ll reduce harm, lower the number of abortions, and treat families with dignity instead of judgment.",
    "588": "I\u2019m guided most by the idea that deeply personal, time-sensitive medical decisions belong with the pregnant person and qualified clinicians, not politicians, and that the law should prioritize safety, privacy, and clear health exceptions so no one is forced into danger. At the same time, I can respect the moral weight many attach to potential life, which is why I want policy to put real muscle behind prevention and support\u2014affordable contraception and healthcare, honest education, and practical help for people who choose to carry a pregnancy. If we measure success by fewer crises and less suffering rather than punishment or slogans, we can protect conscience while building a society where more families actually have workable options.",
    "500": "Abortion law should be guided by medical evidence, personal privacy, and compassion for how complex pregnancy can be, with decisions centered on patients and clinicians rather than politicians. I also take seriously the moral weight many attach to developing life, which is why I support clear, workable protections for health and safety and a focus on preventing crises through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and real support for parents like childcare and paid leave. If we aim for fewer unintended pregnancies and fewer desperate outcomes\u2014without criminalizing families or doctors\u2014we can lower the temperature and protect dignity on all sides.",
    "224": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a sober respect for the moral weight people place on both a pregnant person\u2019s autonomy and developing life. I can live with clear, medically grounded protections that keep urgent decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians\u2014especially for health threats\u2014while pairing any limits with real investments in prevention and support: accurate education, accessible contraception, prenatal care, and practical help for parents and adoption. In the end, \u201cthe measure of a society,\u201d as I\u2019m often reminded in the books I love, is whether our rules reduce harm, protect dignity, and leave room for conscience without turning private crises into public punishments.",
    "746": "I come back to the belief that the law should treat unborn life as morally serious, but also be written clearly enough that doctors can act quickly in true emergencies and families aren\u2019t left to guess in moments of crisis. A workable approach sets reasonable limits with explicit exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and grave medical harm, and it pairs those limits with practical support\u2014prenatal care, adoption options, and real help for women who feel trapped. If we focus less on punishment and politics and more on responsibility, compassion, and prevention, we can reduce abortions while keeping our communities from turning on one another.",
    "53": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for privacy\u2014keeping time-sensitive decisions primarily between a patient and qualified clinicians\u2014while acknowledging the genuine moral weight many people feel about developing life. The most durable common ground, to me, is pairing legal access (with clear, workable health exceptions and medically grounded standards) with serious investment in prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, childcare, and paid leave. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing crises and strengthening families, we can lower harm and lower the temperature without pretending this is an easy issue.",
    "334": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, honest medical evidence, and the reality that these decisions are time-sensitive and deeply personal, so patients and clinicians can act without fear when health or safety is on the line. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many people feel about developing life, which is why any limits should be clear, workable, and paired with real supports\u2014contraception access, prenatal and postpartum care, paid leave, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014so fewer families ever reach a crisis point. If we focus less on punishment and more on prevention, privacy, and practical help, we can protect dignity and reduce suffering even when we don\u2019t agree on every line.",
    "99": "Abortion laws should reflect that there\u2019s real moral weight here, but also that pregnancies can turn into medical emergencies and life-altering situations where doctors need clear room to act and families need privacy. I can live with reasonable, medically grounded limits that include straightforward exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health risks, and I don\u2019t want women or doctors treated like criminals in a crisis. If we truly want fewer abortions, we should put more effort into prevention and support\u2014affordable contraception, solid prenatal care, and real help with adoption and parenting\u2014so people aren\u2019t making choices under pressure and desperation.",
    "628": "I start from a conviction that human life is precious, and I want laws that reflect that seriousness while still making sure no woman in a medical crisis is left waiting on lawyers or paperwork. The most workable approach pairs clear limits with well-defined exceptions for threats to the mother\u2019s life and other heartbreaking cases, and it backs that up with real support\u2014prenatal care, counseling, adoption services, and practical help\u2014so choosing life is not just preached, but possible. If we can agree to keep the tone humane and focus on prevention and support, we can reduce abortions and protect both dignity and life without turning neighbors into enemies.",
    "543": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and the basic idea that deeply personal, time-sensitive decisions belong with the patient and their doctor\u2014not politicians\u2014especially when health or safety is on the line. At the same time, I get why people feel moral weight here, so the best \u201cmiddle\u201d is preventing as many crises as we can with real support: affordable contraception, honest sex education, prenatal care, and help with childcare and finances so choosing to carry a pregnancy isn\u2019t punished by circumstance. If we focus less on blame and more on safety, privacy, and practical help for families, we can lower abortions and suffering without turning people in crisis into criminals.",
    "8": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and a deep respect for privacy\u2014because when families are in crisis, rigid politics can turn a painful moment into danger. I can also respect the moral weight many people feel about potential life, which is why I support clear, workable protections for health and safety and a strong focus on preventing unwanted pregnancies through honest education and affordable contraception. If we\u2019re serious about reducing abortions, we should pair any legal framework with real support for parents\u2014prenatal care, paid leave, childcare, and adoption services\u2014so fewer people feel cornered in the first place.",
    "671": "I think abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and privacy\u2014because in real life, decisions like this are time-sensitive and messy, and politicians shouldn\u2019t be making them harder or more dangerous. At the same time, I get why people feel a real moral weight about potential life, which is why I want a practical focus on preventing unwanted pregnancies through honest sex ed and affordable contraception, plus real support for anyone who chooses to carry\u2014healthcare, paid leave, and childcare. A workable line is one that keeps early care accessible, includes clear exceptions for health and safety, and avoids criminalizing patients or doctors while still taking responsibility and community support seriously.",
    "486": "I keep coming back to two truths at once: ending a pregnancy carries real moral weight, and families can face scary, time\u2011sensitive situations where medical judgment and compassion have to come first. Laws should protect life as much as possible without criminalizing patients or doctors, with clear exceptions for threats to a mother\u2019s life and serious health emergencies, and with practical support\u2014prenatal care, counseling, adoption help, childcare, and access to contraception\u2014so fewer people feel cornered. If we focus on preventing crises and backing families after birth, we can lower abortions while treating everyone with dignity instead of turning private pain into politics.",
    "452": "I believe laws on abortion should start with a real respect for human life, but they also have to be written with compassion and medical reality in mind so families and doctors can act quickly when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at risk. Clear limits can make sense, yet the rules should include workable exceptions for the hardest cases and avoid turning people in crisis into criminals. If we want fewer abortions, we should put more energy into prevention and support\u2014better access to contraception, prenatal care, honest counseling, and stronger adoption and family resources\u2014so choosing life is truly possible and no one is left alone.",
    "514": "I believe abortion law should start with respect for human life and personal responsibility, but it also has to be written in a way that\u2019s workable in the real world, with clear medical exceptions so doctors can act fast when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is on the line and families aren\u2019t left in limbo. If we truly want fewer abortions, we should put as much energy into prevention and support\u2014accessible contraception, solid prenatal care, and stronger adoption and family resources\u2014so choosing to carry a pregnancy isn\u2019t just a demand, it\u2019s a realistic option. We may never agree on every line, but we can agree the goal is less suffering, fewer crises, and laws that are firm, humane, and predictable.",
    "212": "I believe laws on abortion should start with a serious respect for unborn life, while also facing the painful realities families sometimes meet and making sure clear medical exceptions exist so doctors can act quickly to protect a mother\u2019s life and health. If we truly want fewer abortions, we should put just as much effort into prevention and support\u2014good prenatal care, adoption services, counseling, and practical help for parents\u2014so no one feels cornered by fear or finances. We won\u2019t agree on every moral line, but we can agree that compassion, honest medical standards, and strong community care should guide policy more than politics or punishment.",
    "307": "I\u2019m guided by a respect for life and by a practical insistence that laws be clear, consistent, and workable in real emergencies, with unambiguous exceptions so doctors can act quickly when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at risk. At the same time, I don\u2019t think the debate gets better by punishing people in crisis; the most serious effort should go into prevention and support\u2014access to contraception, solid prenatal care, and adoption and parenting resources\u2014so fewer families ever reach this crossroads. If we focus on measurable harm reduction, honest medical standards, and real help for women and children after birth, we can protect dignity and lower the temperature even when we don\u2019t agree on every line.",
    "565": "I\u2019m not comfortable with laws that treat abortion like an easy decision, because I do believe unborn life deserves real respect, but I also don\u2019t want rules so rigid that they end up hurting women in medical emergencies or forcing doctors to hesitate. The most workable line to me is clear limits with plainly written exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health risks, and compassion in cases of rape or incest, so families aren\u2019t left in fear or legal gray areas. If we\u2019re serious about fewer abortions, we should put just as much effort into prevention and support\u2014access to contraception, prenatal care, adoption options, and practical help for parents\u2014so choosing life is something people can actually manage, not just something they\u2019re told to do.",
    "206": "Abortion laws should be guided by a sober respect for unborn life and by practical compassion for people facing messy, time\u2011sensitive medical realities, with clear, workable exceptions when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at risk and in the hardest cases of violence. I\u2019ve learned that in a crisis, vague rules and political second\u2011guessing don\u2019t help\u2014plain standards that doctors can follow and families can understand do. If we want fewer abortions and less bitterness, we should pair limits with real prevention and support: access to contraception and prenatal care, straightforward adoption options, and concrete help for parents so choosing life is possible, not just preached.",
    "399": "I see abortion as a morally serious decision where the law should protect life while also staying grounded in medical reality, privacy, and compassion for families in crisis. The rules need to be clear and workable so doctors can act quickly in emergencies, with well-defined exceptions for threats to the mother\u2019s life and severe circumstances, rather than creating fear and confusion. If the shared goal is fewer abortions and healthier families, then prevention and support\u2014accessible contraception, honest education, prenatal care, adoption options, and real help after birth\u2014should be the center of policy, not punishment.",
    "673": "I\u2019ve seen up close how messy real-life pregnancies and medical emergencies can be, so laws should protect timely, evidence-based care and keep deeply personal decisions between a patient and their clinician, not politicians. At the same time, I respect that many people feel a genuine moral duty to protect developing life, which is why I want policy to put serious weight on preventing unintended pregnancies through honest education, affordable contraception, and strong support for anyone who carries a pregnancy. If we lead with compassion and practical help\u2014rather than punishment\u2014we can reduce harm, reduce the number of abortions, and make room for conscience without abandoning people in crisis.",
    "773": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, privacy, and medical reality\u2014decisions should stay mainly between a patient and a qualified clinician, not politicians\u2014while acknowledging that many people feel real moral weight about potential life. The most honest common ground is preventing crises in the first place with comprehensive sex ed, affordable contraception, and real support for pregnancy, birth, and childcare so carrying a pregnancy is a feasible option, not just a demand. If there are limits, they should be clear, evidence-based, and include workable exceptions for health and safety so no one is pushed into dangerous delays or desperation.",
    "277": "Abortion laws should take the value of unborn life seriously while also being clear, workable, and humane in the real emergencies and heartbreaking situations families face, so doctors aren\u2019t forced to hesitate when a mother\u2019s life or health is on the line. I can live with reasonable limits paired with straightforward exceptions and a big focus on preventing crises in the first place\u2014access to contraception, honest education, strong prenatal care, and real support for adoption and parents. If we\u2019re serious about fewer abortions and healthier families, the law can\u2019t just draw lines; it has to back them up with practical help and basic dignity for everyone involved.",
    "362": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and a real respect for life that includes the health and dignity of the person who is pregnant\u2014keeping urgent decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians, not politicians. At the same time, if we\u2019re serious about fewer abortions and healthier families, we should put our energy into prevention and support: affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal and mental-health care, and practical help for parents and adoption. When the rules are clear, evidence-based, and paired with real resources, it\u2019s easier to honor different moral convictions without pushing anyone into danger or desperation.",
    "95": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for privacy, keeping time-sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians rather than politicians. I also take seriously the moral weight many people feel about potential life, which is why I support clear, workable protections for health and life and policies that prevent crises in the first place\u2014reliable contraception, honest education, and real support for parents and children. If we focus on reducing harm and expanding genuine options instead of punishment and stigma, we can lower the number of abortions while treating families with dignity.",
    "327": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a respect for both developing life and the person who is pregnant, keeping urgent decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians instead of politicians. I can support clear, workable limits only if they come with straightforward exceptions for life and serious health risks and don\u2019t criminalize families or healthcare providers acting in good faith. The most common ground, to me, is preventing crises in the first place with honest education, affordable contraception, and real support for parents\u2014prenatal care, paid leave, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered. If laws focus on safety, dignity, and practical help, they can lower harm and lower the temperature at the same time.",
    "81": "I\u2019ve come to believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and the basic idea that private, time-sensitive healthcare decisions belong with the patient and their doctor\u2014not politicians\u2014especially when health or safety is on the line. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many people feel about potential life, which is why I\u2019d put serious effort into what actually reduces abortions: reliable contraception, honest education, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real economic support so choosing to carry a pregnancy isn\u2019t a privilege. The common ground I see is this: fewer crises, clearer protections in emergencies, and a society that helps families instead of punishing people in pain.",
    "608": "I take the value of unborn life seriously, but I also don\u2019t want laws written so rigidly that families and doctors hesitate in real emergencies or heartbreaking situations. What makes sense to me is clear, workable limits with straightforward exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health risks, and a focus on reducing abortions by making it easier to choose life through prenatal care, adoption support, and practical help for parents. If we keep the tone humane and the rules medically grounded, we can protect life while treating people in crisis with dignity instead of turning them into political targets.",
    "533": "I\u2019m guided by respect for life and personal responsibility, but also by the reality that emergencies and heartbreaking situations don\u2019t fit neat rules, so any law has to include clear, workable exceptions to protect a woman\u2019s life and health and let doctors act without hesitation. If we want fewer abortions, we should put as much effort into prevention and support\u2014access to contraception, solid prenatal care, and real help with adoption and parenting\u2014so people aren\u2019t cornered by fear or finances. I can live with limits that are consistent and enforceable, as long as they\u2019re paired with compassion and practical support instead of punishment and politics.",
    "631": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion and medical reality: keep time\u2011sensitive decisions between a patient and qualified clinicians, with clear protections for health, emergencies, and heartbreaking circumstances, instead of criminalizing people in crisis. At the same time, if we truly want fewer abortions, we should invest in what many of us can agree on\u2014affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, childcare, and paid leave\u2014so parenting is a real option, not a luxury. To me, \u201c\u6551\u6025\u5148\u4e8e\u8bba\u7406\u201d matters here: protect safety and dignity first, and then build policies that reduce suffering for families and make room for sincere moral differences.",

At the same time, if we genuinely want fewer abortions, we should put real muscle behind prevention and support: better access to contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and adoption and community resources that make choosing life feasible. I can live with clear, workable limits and clearly written exceptions, but I don\u2019t want policies that punish people in crisis or turn private medical decisions into political warfare.",
    "724": "I was raised to treat life as sacred, but I\u2019ve also seen enough hard turns in life to know that pregnancies can bring real danger and heartbreak, and the law shouldn\u2019t leave doctors and families afraid to act in an emergency. I can support clear limits that protect unborn life, as long as there are plain, workable exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and mercy in the hardest cases. If we truly want fewer abortions, we should put just as much effort into prevention and support\u2014responsible education, access to contraception, prenatal care, and strong adoption and family resources\u2014so fewer women feel trapped and alone.",
    "166": "I don\u2019t want politicians climbing into the cab on this one\u2014these are private, time\u2011sensitive medical decisions that should stay between a person and their doctor, with clear protections for the mother\u2019s health and no criminal penalties that scare providers from doing their jobs. At the same time, I get why people feel the moral weight of potential life, so the smartest law is one that focuses on preventing crisis pregnancies through affordable contraception, honest education, and real support for women who carry to term or choose adoption. If we aim for fewer abortions by expanding options and keeping the rules practical and humane, we can respect both liberty and life without turning neighbors into enemies.",
    "185": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for privacy, because when life gets complicated the last thing families need is politicians second-guessing time\u2011sensitive healthcare decisions. At the same time, I hear the moral weight many people place on potential life, and I think the most honest common ground is preventing crises in the first place with comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and real support for parents\u2014healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. Whatever limits exist, they should be clear, evidence-based, and include workable protections for health and safety, without criminalizing patients or doctors. If we focus on dignity, prevention, and practical help, we can reduce harm and lower the temperature while respecting deeply different convictions.",
    "284": "I think abortion laws should be guided by compassion and real medical facts, keeping time-sensitive decisions primarily between a patient and their doctor instead of turning a hard moment into a courtroom or a headline. At the same time, I hear the moral weight many people feel about potential life, which is why I\u2019d pair legal access\u2014especially early on and in health emergencies\u2014with serious investment in contraception, honest sex education, prenatal care, and childcare so fewer people ever feel trapped. If we focus on safety, privacy, and practical support for parents and kids, we can lower the number of crises without shaming or criminalizing people who are already struggling.",
    "320": "I\u2019ve come to believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, sound medical evidence, and a respect for personal conscience\u2014keeping time-sensitive decisions between patients and qualified clinicians instead of turning them into political punishments. At the same time, I take seriously the moral weight many attach to developing life, which is why I support a strong, practical safety net that prevents crisis pregnancies through affordable contraception and honest education, and supports families with prenatal care, mental-health care, paid leave, and childcare. If we focus on reducing harm and making real options available\u2014rather than shaming people\u2014we can protect health, dignity, and life in a way more neighbors can live with.",
    "230": "I want abortion laws grounded in medical reality, privacy, and compassion, because once you\u2019ve seen how unpredictable bodies, finances, and relationships can be, it\u2019s hard to believe a one-size-fits-all rule won\u2019t hurt someone in a crisis. At the same time, I respect that many people feel real moral weight about potential life, so I\u2019m open to clear, workable limits only if they come with strong exceptions for health and safety and are paired with serious investments in prevention\u2014contraception, honest sex education, and real support for parents. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing unwanted pregnancies and protecting people\u2019s dignity, we can lower the number of tragedies without turning private medical decisions into a political weapon.",
    "447": "Laws on abortion should be guided by constitutional principles of privacy and due process, deference to medical judgment in time-sensitive situations, and a practical commitment to reducing harm rather than scoring moral victories. I can respect the sincere concern for potential life, but a durable framework has to keep patients and clinicians out of the criminal dock, allow clear exceptions for life and health, and avoid vague standards that chill emergency care. The best common ground is pairing legal access\u2014especially early in pregnancy\u2014with serious investments in prevention and support: contraception, accurate education, prenatal care, paid leave, and childcare, so fewer people ever face this crisis. If we focus on dignity, clarity, and measurable outcomes for families, we can lower the temperature while protecting both conscience and safety.",
    "149": "I\u2019ve spent a lot of time around heavy equipment and hard ground, and I\u2019ve learned you don\u2019t make anything safer by pretending the risks aren\u2019t there\u2014so abortion laws should be clear, workable, and grounded in real medical judgment, with firm exceptions when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is on the line and for the worst cases like rape or incest. At the same time, I can\u2019t shake the moral weight many feel about unborn life, which is why I\u2019d rather see prevention and support do more of the lifting: better access to contraception, strong prenatal care, and real adoption and parenting resources. If we focus on fewer crisis pregnancies, safer outcomes, and less political grandstanding in the exam room, we can protect dignity and responsibility without turning neighbors into enemies.",
    "192": "I want abortion laws guided by medical evidence, privacy, and compassion, with decisions kept as close as possible to the patient and clinician\u2014especially early on and in emergencies\u2014rather than by politicians writing one-size-fits-all rules. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many people feel about developing life, so I\u2019m open to clear, workable guardrails later in pregnancy as long as they include real exceptions for health, severe fetal problems, and cases of violence. The most durable common ground is to invest hard in prevention and support\u2014reliable sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and maternal care, adoption and foster reforms, and paid leave and childcare\u2014so fewer families ever face a crisis decision. If we focus on outcomes and dignity instead of punishment and point-scoring, we can reduce harm while making space for conscience on all sides.",
    "635": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a sincere respect for unborn life, paired with compassion for the real emergencies and tragedies families face, so doctors can act quickly when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at risk. I can live with clear, reasonable limits that reflect the moral weight of the decision, but they should come with workable exceptions for rape, incest, and severe medical complications\u2014not vague rules that leave people frightened and providers guessing.

If we keep the focus on responsibility, compassion, and clear medical standards instead of political scoring, we can lower the number of abortions and treat people in crisis with dignity."
