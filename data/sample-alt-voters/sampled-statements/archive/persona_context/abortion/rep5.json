    "107": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and the goal of reducing harm\u2014keeping urgent health decisions between a patient and qualified clinicians, with clear, workable protections for life-threatening situations and other severe circumstances. I can respect the moral weight many people place on potential life, which is why I also want serious investment in prevention and support: contraception access, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families so fewer people ever feel cornered. Whatever lines the law draws, it should be written clearly, avoid turning crisis into criminal cases, and focus on safer outcomes for women, children, and communities.",
    "576": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal conscience\u2014keeping politicians out of the exam room while making sure care is safe, timely, and never treated like a crime. At the same time, if we truly want fewer abortions, we should invest in what prevents crisis in the first place: affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real support for families so no one feels cornered by fear or money. La verdad, a law that protects health and dignity and offers practical help is more humane than one that punishes people at their hardest moment.",
    "328": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for human life and by rules that are clear enough to work in the real world, especially in medical emergencies where doctors need to act fast. I can support firm limits that reflect the seriousness of ending a pregnancy, paired with well-defined exceptions when a mother\u2019s life is at stake and compassion for truly hard cases. The best common ground is putting real effort into prevention and support\u2014responsible education, access to contraception, and practical help with prenatal care and adoption\u2014so fewer families ever reach this point.",
    "79": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal conscience\u2014keeping politicians out of the exam room while making sure care is safe, timely, and not treated like a crime. I also think we can honor the moral seriousness many people feel by focusing on what actually prevents crisis: affordable contraception, honest education, real prenatal and postpartum care, and practical support so no one is pushed into a decision by fear, money, or lack of options. If we put dignity, health, and reducing harm at the center, we can lower the number of unwanted pregnancies while still respecting the difficult situations families and doctors face.",
    "330": "I believe laws on abortion should start with respeto por la vida and a real concern for the woman\u2019s health, written clearly so doctors can act fast in true emergencies and people aren\u2019t treated like criminals in a moment of fear. At the same time, the best way to lower abortions is to prevent crisis pregnancies and make it practical to choose to carry to term\u2014affordable healthcare, honest education, contraception, and strong support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption. If the law keeps compassion and responsibility at the center, we can protect dignity on both sides and reduce suffering instead of turning families into political battlegrounds.",
    "581": "Laws on abortion should start from the belief that human life has real dignity, while staying honest about medical realities and the complicated situations families can face when a pregnancy becomes a crisis. I support clear limits paired with workable, well-defined exceptions when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at risk, and I don\u2019t want doctors or patients treated like criminals for acting in good faith. If we want fewer abortions and less suffering, we should put just as much energy into prevention and support\u2014responsible education, contraception, prenatal care, and practical help for parenting and adoption\u2014so choosing life is truly possible.",
    "502": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a steady respect for human life, paired with clear compassion for women and families who find themselves in frightening, complicated situations. I can support firm, understandable limits that reflect the seriousness of ending a pregnancy, as long as there are workable medical exceptions so doctors can act quickly to protect a mother\u2019s life and health. Common ground is doing more to prevent crisis pregnancies and to make choosing life truly possible\u2014through prenatal care, counseling, adoption support, and practical help\u2014so the law isn\u2019t just a demand, but a commitment to care.",
    "129": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for human life and by the practical need for clear, workable rules that protect women in medical emergencies and let doctors act fast without fear. I can support reasonable limits paired with straightforward exceptions for threats to the mother\u2019s life and serious health, and I also think the best way to reduce abortions is prevention and real support\u2014reliable contraception, honest education, prenatal care, and adoption resources. If we focus less on punishment and more on responsibility, dignity, and helping families through hard situations, we can lower the temperature and protect more people on all sides.",
    "623": "I see abortion as a serious moral issue where the law should protect developing life, but it also has to be clear and workable so doctors can act fast in medical emergencies and families aren\u2019t turned into criminals during a crisis. Common ground starts with reducing the situations that lead people here in the first place\u2014better prevention, straight answers, and real support for pregnancy, adoption, and raising kids so choosing life doesn\u2019t feel impossible. If policy is built around responsibility, compassion, and practical help instead of punishment or politics, I think we can lower the temperature and reduce harm on all sides.",
    "241": "I want abortion laws to be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for human dignity, so time-sensitive decisions stay primarily between a patient and trusted clinicians without fear of criminalization. At the same time, I can\u2019t ignore the moral weight many attach to developing life, which is why I support clear, workable guardrails with explicit exceptions for threats to health and life, rape or incest, and severe fetal conditions. The most durable common ground is prevention and support: affordable contraception, accurate education, and strong prenatal and postpartum care plus practical help so no one feels forced into any decision by poverty, isolation, or lack of access.",
    "736": "I want abortion laws that keep politicians out of the exam room and trust patients and doctors to make time\u2011sensitive decisions, with clear protections for health, safety, and privacy and without criminalizing people in crisis. At the same time, I can\u2019t ignore that many see real moral value in developing life, so the most honest common ground is preventing unwanted pregnancies and making it genuinely possible to continue a pregnancy through affordable contraception, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real economic support. Good policy should be medically grounded, compassionate, and practical: fewer tragedies, more real choices, and stronger support for families whatever they decide.",
    "755": "I don\u2019t think politicians should be making one-size-fits-all calls in the exam room, but I also don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight people feel about potential life, so the law should protect safe, timely medical care with clear exceptions for health emergencies, rape, and severe fetal complications. The best way to lower abortions and lower the temperature is to invest hard in what actually prevents crisis\u2014honest sex education, affordable contraception, and real support for parents like healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. If we center dignity, medical reality, and community responsibility instead of punishment, we can protect people in the toughest moments and still work toward fewer tragedies.",
    "315": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and a respect for conscience\u2014keeping politicians out of the exam room while making sure care is safe, timely, and clearly protected when health or life is on the line. At the same time, I can\u2019t ignore the moral weight many attach to developing life, which is why I support practical steps that prevent crisis pregnancies in the first place: affordable contraception, honest education, and strong prenatal, postpartum, and disability supports. If we pair reasonable, medically grounded guardrails with real help for parents and families, we can reduce abortions and suffering without turning personal tragedy into punishment.",
    "271": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion and medical reality, with decisions kept as close as possible to the patient and clinician, and with clear protections so no one is forced into danger or delays when health is at risk. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many people place on potential life, which is why I\u2019d pair legal access with serious prevention\u2014honest education, affordable contraception\u2014and practical support like prenatal/postpartum care, paid leave, and childcare. If we focus less on punishment and more on safety, dignity, and real options, we can reduce unwanted pregnancies and lower the temperature without forcing one set of beliefs on everyone.",
    "213": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a deep respect for human life, while also being honest about the medical realities that can make pregnancy dangerous or heartbreaking. I favor clear, workable limits paired with explicit protections so clinicians can act quickly in emergencies, and I don\u2019t want scared patients or good-faith doctors turned into criminals. The best common ground is to prevent crisis pregnancies and reduce abortions by expanding practical support\u2014prenatal and postpartum care, counseling, adoption services, and reliable access to contraception\u2014so choosing life is truly possible, not just demanded.",
    "128": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a respect for privacy\u2014keeping politicians out of the exam room while making sure care is safe, timely, and clearly protected when someone\u2019s health or life is on the line. I can\u2019t ignore that many people see real moral value in developing life, so I\u2019m willing to live with practical, medically grounded guardrails that are written clearly and don\u2019t criminalize patients or doctors acting in good faith. The best common ground is putting serious effort into prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and real help for families\u2014so fewer people ever feel trapped in a crisis decision.",
    "615": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal conscience\u2014keeping politicians out of the exam room while making sure care is safe, timely, and based on evidence. I can honor the moral seriousness many people feel about potential life and still believe the best way to reduce abortions is prevention and support: educaci\u00f3n honesta, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real help so no one feels forced by fear or money. If we write clear rules with workable health exceptions and stop treating families in crisis like criminals, we can protect dignity and reduce suffering\u2014para que nadie se sienta sola.",
    "226": "I don\u2019t want politicians turning a complicated, time-sensitive medical decision into punishment, so laws should protect private, safe care with clear exceptions when health is at risk or pregnancy comes from violence. At the same time, I hear the moral weight people feel about potential life, and I think real common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies and making it easier to choose parenting if someone wants\u2014through affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal/postpartum care, and support like childcare and paid leave. If the goal is fewer abortions and less suffering, we should lead with compassion, medical reality, and practical help instead of shame.",
    "171": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal conscience\u2014keeping time-sensitive decisions primarily between a patient and qualified clinicians, without turning families in crisis or doctors into criminals. At the same time, I hear the moral weight many people place on potential life, and I think the most honest common ground is preventing unintended pregnancies and supporting families with affordable contraception, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help like childcare and paid leave. If we focus on fewer crises, safer care, and real options instead of shame or politics, we can protect dignity and reduce harm even when we don\u2019t agree on every line.",
    "698": "I believe laws on abortion should be guided by respect for life, personal responsibility, and compassion, with clear rules that protect unborn life while allowing doctors to act quickly in true medical emergencies and other rare, heartbreaking cases. To reduce abortions in a real way, we should put more effort into prevention and support\u2014good health care, counseling, and practical help so a family can carry a pregnancy without being crushed by fear or money. If the law is firm but humane, and the community does more to support mothers and children, people with very different beliefs can still agree on fewer tragedies and stronger families.",
    "297": "I\u2019m guided by a mix of conscience and practicality: ending a pregnancy carries moral weight, but so do the health, safety, and future of the person who\u2019s pregnant, and I don\u2019t want politicians substituting for doctors in urgent, complicated situations. A workable law should protect safe, timely care with clear exceptions when health is at risk, and it shouldn\u2019t criminalize patients or clinicians acting in good faith. If we\u2019re serious about fewer abortions, the strongest common ground is prevention and support\u2014affordable contraception and honest education, plus prenatal/postpartum care, paid leave, childcare, and a reliable adoption and foster system\u2014so people aren\u2019t pushed into choices by fear or money.",
    "701": "Laws on abortion should reflect a respect for life, but also be written in a way that\u2019s clear, medically realistic, and doesn\u2019t turn families and doctors into criminals when an emergency hits. I can support firm limits that recognize the seriousness of ending a pregnancy, paired with workable exceptions when a woman\u2019s life or serious health is at risk and in the hardest cases like rape or incest. Common ground is putting real effort into prevention and support\u2014responsible education, access to contraception, strong prenatal care, and adoption and family resources\u2014so fewer people ever feel trapped into this choice.",
    "265": "Abortion law should be guided by medical reality, compassion, and a clear respect for the seriousness of ending a pregnancy, keeping politicians from second\u2011guessing patients and clinicians in time-sensitive situations. I can live with reasonable, medically grounded guardrails and clear exceptions for threats to health, rape, incest, and nonviable pregnancies, as long as the rules are written plainly enough that doctors can act without fear. If we truly want fewer abortions and healthier families, we should put at least as much energy into prevention and support\u2014affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help so no one feels pushed into a decision by money or isolation.",
    "331": "I want abortion laws guided by medical reality, privacy, and compassion\u2014written clearly enough that doctors can act fast to protect health and life, without turning patients in crisis into criminals. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many attach to potential life, which is why I\u2019d pair legal access\u2014especially early in pregnancy and in hard cases\u2014with serious investment in prevention: contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical support so no one is forced into a decision by fear or money. The common ground I see is fewer unintended pregnancies, fewer tragedies, and more dignity for everyone involved.",
    "47": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a serious respect for developing human life and by the practical need for clear, workable rules that let doctors act quickly in true medical emergencies without turning families\u2019 worst moments into criminal cases. I favor reasonable limits that reflect the moral gravity of the decision, paired with narrowly defined exceptions for threats to the mother\u2019s life and severe medical situations, and I think we can reduce abortions far more by investing in prevention and support\u2014contraception, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, and adoption resources. If we focus less on punishing and more on reducing crisis pregnancies while protecting health and dignity, we can move toward policy that more people can live with even when they disagree about first principles.",
    "491": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, clear medical facts, and respect for life, without turning families or doctors into criminals when they\u2019re facing an emergency or a painful situation. The government should set practical, understandable rules with strong protections for a pregnant person\u2019s health, while also investing in prevention\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, and real support for pregnancy, adoption, and parenting\u2014so fewer people ever get pushed into this decision by fear or money. If we focus on safety, responsibility, and helping working families, I think we can lower the anger and find rules most people can live with.",
    "637": "I\u2019m guided by the conviction that human life has dignity, but I also know from real-world care that pregnancies can turn into medical crises quickly, so the law has to be clear, humane, and allow doctors to act without fear when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at risk. I can support firm, reasonable limits that reflect the moral weight of abortion, paired with practical help\u2014prenatal and postpartum care, counseling, adoption support, and real accountability for fathers\u2014so fewer women feel cornered. If we focus less on punishment and more on prevention and support, we can protect more life while treating people in painful situations with compassion.",
    "486": "I want laws on abortion to be guided by the dignity of human life and real compassion for the messy, time-sensitive situations families face, with clear medical exceptions so doctors can act quickly when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at risk. At the same time, I don\u2019t think the answer can just be punishment or politics; we should make it easier to choose life by expanding prenatal and postpartum care, honest counseling, adoption support, and practical help like childcare and stable access to healthy food. If we focus on prevention and support\u2014so fewer people feel cornered in the first place\u2014I think more of us can agree on reducing suffering and protecting families.",
    "651": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal conscience\u2014keeping politicians out of time-sensitive healthcare decisions while making sure care is safe, legal, and clearly protected when health or viability is at stake. I can\u2019t ignore that many people feel a moral duty to protect developing life, which is why I also want serious investment in what actually prevents crisis pregnancies: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical support that makes parenting or adoption a real option. If we focus less on punishment and more on dignity, prevention, and workable medical standards, we can reduce suffering and lower the number of abortions without tearing communities apart.",
    "246": "I want abortion laws to be guided by compassion, medical reality, and the freedom for families to make time\u2011sensitive decisions with their doctors, without fear of punishment when health or safety is at stake. At the same time, I respect the moral seriousness many people feel about potential life, which is why I favor clear, workable rules paired with strong prevention and support\u2014reliable sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for parents and adoption\u2014so fewer people are pushed into crisis. If we focus on dignity, safety, and reducing unwanted pregnancies rather than shaming or political point\u2011scoring, we can protect both conscience and wellbeing in a way more neighbors can live with.",
    "117": "I see abortion as a serious moral issue where the law should protect developing life whenever possible, but it also has to be clear, workable, and leave doctors room to act fast in true medical emergencies and other rare, traumatic situations. What makes sense to me is pairing reasonable limits and well-defined exceptions with practical prevention and support\u2014better access to contraception and honest education, plus prenatal care, adoption resources, and real help for parents\u2014so fewer families ever feel cornered into a crisis. If we keep the focus on responsibility, compassion, and outcomes for women and kids instead of punishment and politics, we can find rules most people can live with even when we don\u2019t agree on every line.",
    "172": "I want abortion laws to be grounded in compassion, medical reality, and respect for conscience\u2014keeping politicians out of the exam room while making sure care is safe, timely, and clearly protected when health, rape, incest, or severe fetal complications are involved. I also hear the moral seriousness many people attach to potential life, which is why I think any legal framework should be paired with strong prevention and support: accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and real help for families who choose to continue a pregnancy. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing crisis pregnancies and supporting healthy children and communities, we can lower the temperature and reduce harm even when we disagree about where every legal line should be.",
    "259": "I\u2019m guided by the belief that life is sacred, but I also know families can face messy, time-sensitive situations where fear, health risks, and finances all hit at once, so laws should be clear, humane, and written so doctors can act quickly in true medical emergencies. I can support reasonable limits that reflect the moral seriousness here, paired with practical supports\u2014prenatal and postpartum care, counseling, adoption help, and affordable childcare\u2014so choosing to carry a pregnancy doesn\u2019t feel like a dead end. If we put more effort into prevention through honest education and accessible contraception, and less into punishment and politics, we can lower the number of abortions while treating everyone with dignity.",
    "501": "I don\u2019t think the government should turn a time\u2011sensitive medical decision into a criminal issue; it should protect privacy and safe care, with clear exceptions for health emergencies and cases of violence, and let doctors do their jobs. At the same time, I hear the moral seriousness many people feel, and I think the most shared path forward is preventing crisis pregnancies and making real support easier to access\u2014reliable birth control, honest sex ed, prenatal/postpartum care, paid leave, childcare, and adoption resources. If we focus on reducing harm and expanding real options instead of shaming or punishing, we can respect conscience while helping fewer people end up in an impossible situation.",
    "427": "I want abortion laws that keep the focus on real-life medical care\u2014clear, medically grounded rules that protect timely treatment, privacy, and the ability for a patient and doctor to make decisions without fear of criminal punishment, especially when health or safety is at stake. At the same time, I can respect the moral seriousness many people feel about potential life, which is why I support practical steps that prevent crisis pregnancies and make continuing a pregnancy more doable: affordable contraception, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real support for parents. If we aim for fewer emergencies and fewer unwanted pregnancies, we can lower the temperature and write policy that\u2019s compassionate, workable, and centered on dignity.",
    "247": "I want laws on abortion to be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a commitment to keep people safe, with decisions made as close as possible to the patient and clinician rather than politicians. At the same time, I can respect the moral gravity many attach to potential life, which is why I\u2019d pair any legal framework with real prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help so no one feels forced by poverty or isolation. If we focus on reducing harm and expanding real options\u2014before and after birth\u2014we can lower the temperature and make fewer families face a crisis in the first place.",
    "446": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for human life, but they also have to deal honestly with medical reality so doctors can act fast in true emergencies and families aren\u2019t treated like criminals in a crisis. I can support clear limits with narrowly written exceptions for the hardest cases, paired with real, practical help\u2014prenatal and postpartum care, counseling, adoption support, and accountability for fathers\u2014so choosing life is something people can actually manage. If we focus less on politics and more on preventing unwanted pregnancies and backing up families after birth, we can reduce abortions and lower the temperature at the same time.",
    "198": "To me, abortion law should be guided by clear medical reality, respect for conscience, and a commitment to reducing harm\u2014because in high-stakes decisions you need rules that are workable and don\u2019t leave doctors or families guessing in a crisis. I can\u2019t get comfortable with one-size-fits-all mandates or criminal penalties, but I also understand why many people feel a real moral responsibility to protect developing life, especially as a pregnancy progresses. The common ground I see is pairing safe, timely care and well-defined exceptions for health threats, rape, and severe fetal complications with serious investment in prevention and support\u2014contraception, accurate education, prenatal/postpartum care, adoption options, and practical help for families\u2014so fewer people ever reach that painful crossroads.",
    "162": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and the belief that healthcare decisions work best when they stay between a patient and qualified clinicians\u2014especially when time and safety are on the line\u2014without turning fear and crisis into punishment. At the same time, I can respect the moral weight many people feel about potential life, which is why I want policies that prevent unwanted pregnancies and make it easier to carry a pregnancy if that\u2019s the choice: affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real support for parents. If we focus on protecting health, privacy, and practical help for families, we can lower the heat and reduce harm even when we don\u2019t agree on every legal line.",
    "604": "Abortion law should keep politicians out of the exam room and leave the decision primarily to the pregnant person and their doctor, with clear, workable protections so care is safe and timely\u2014especially when health, rape, or severe fetal complications are involved. At the same time, I don\u2019t ignore the moral weight many people feel, so I\u2019d rather see the real energy go into prevention and support: affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help so nobody feels cornered by money or fear. The goal I can get behind is fewer crisis pregnancies, fewer abortions, and rules written clearly enough that they don\u2019t turn families or clinicians into criminals for handling a hard reality.",
    "7": "I\u2019m guided by a respect for life and a strong belief that government should stay out of private medical decisions whenever possible, especially when real pregnancies can turn complicated fast and families are already stretched thin. The most durable laws will keep care safe and timely with clear, workable protections for medical emergencies and severe fetal complications, while avoiding criminalizing patients or doctors. At the same time, if we\u2019re serious about fewer abortions, we should invest upstream in contraception, honest education, and strong prenatal and postpartum support so fewer people feel cornered into a choice.",
    "475": "I\u2019ve come to think abortion law should be guided by two truths at once: ending a pregnancy carries real moral weight, and real-life pregnancies can turn complicated fast in ways politicians can\u2019t script. The most workable path is clear, medically grounded rules that keep doctors free to protect a patient\u2019s life and serious health, avoid criminalizing people in crisis, and set reasonable guardrails that reflect how pregnancy changes over time. Just as important, we should put more effort into prevention and support\u2014straight talk and education, affordable contraception, solid prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for parenting or adoption\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into that decision.",
    "478": "I\u2019ve spent a lifetime trying to leave places healthier and conflicts a little less bitter, and that makes me wary of laws that turn private medical crises into public punishment. To me, the guiding principles should be compassion, medical reality, and personal conscience\u2014protecting safe, timely care with clear exceptions when health is at risk\u2014while doing far more to prevent unintended pregnancies through honest education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal and family support. We may never agree on exactly when legal interests begin, but we can agree that fewer desperate choices, healthier mothers and babies, and policies written with clarity and humility are goals worth uniting around.",
    "52": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and basic privacy\u2014keeping politicians out of time\u2011sensitive healthcare decisions while making sure care is safe, legal, and includes clear protections when someone\u2019s health is at risk. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many people feel about potential life, which is why I\u2019d put real energy into preventing unwanted pregnancies and making it easier to choose to carry a pregnancy through affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal/postpartum care, and practical support for parents. If the goal is fewer abortions and less suffering, the law should focus less on punishment and more on reducing the pressures that back people into impossible choices.",
    "231": "Abortion law should start with respect for unborn life, but it also has to be written in a way that\u2019s clear enough for doctors to act fast in real emergencies and humane enough that scared people aren\u2019t treated like criminals. I can support firm, reasonable limits with well-defined exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and I\u2019m open to narrowly drawn exceptions for cases like rape and incest because the real world isn\u2019t neat. Common ground, to me, is doing more to prevent unwanted pregnancies and make choosing life doable\u2014responsible education, access to contraception, and practical support for prenatal care, adoption, and families. If we keep the focus on responsibility, compassion, and workable rules instead of politics, we can lower the temperature and reduce harm.",
    "512": "I start from the belief that human life has dignity, but I also can\u2019t ignore how messy and time\u2011sensitive pregnancy can be when health, violence, or devastating diagnoses are involved, so laws should be clear enough that doctors can act quickly and families aren\u2019t treated like criminals in a crisis. The best guardrails combine reasonable limits with specific, workable exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and they should be paired with real support\u2014prenatal care, counseling, adoption help, and practical resources\u2014so choosing to carry a pregnancy isn\u2019t just \u201crequired,\u201d it\u2019s actually possible. If we focus less on punishment and more on prevention and care, we can reduce abortions while still respecting conscience and protecting women\u2019s safety.",
    "516": "I want abortion laws that protect safe, timely medical care and keep the most difficult decisions centered on the pregnant person and their doctor, not politicians or prosecutors\u2014especially when health, sexual violence, or severe fetal complications are involved. At the same time, I hear the moral seriousness many people attach to potential life, which is why I support clear, medically grounded guardrails alongside real efforts to prevent unintended pregnancies through honest education and affordable contraception. If we\u2019re serious about reducing abortions and suffering, we should pair whatever legal framework we choose with practical support for families\u2014healthcare, prenatal and postpartum care, and help that makes parenting or adoption a workable option.",
    "32": "I believe laws on abortion should be guided first by respect for human life, but also by the medical reality that some pregnancies become emergencies where doctors need clear, workable room to protect a woman\u2019s life and health. At the same time, if we truly want fewer abortions, we should focus less on punishment and more on prevention and support\u2014honest education, access to contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help so families aren\u2019t pushed into desperate choices. A humane approach sets understandable limits with compassionate exceptions, and backs them up with real resources so choosing life is possible, not just demanded.",
    "135": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a consistent respect for human life and human dignity, paired with the humility to admit that pregnancies can involve medical emergencies and heartbreaking circumstances where timely clinical judgment matters. I can support clear limits that reflect the seriousness of ending a pregnancy, as long as they include workable, well-defined exceptions to protect a mother\u2019s life and health and don\u2019t turn patients or doctors into criminals acting in good faith. The best common ground is to put real effort into prevention and support\u2014accurate education, access to contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, adoption services, and practical help\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into this decision. If we focus on clarity, compassion, and responsibility rather than punishment and politics, we can reduce harm and build more trust on all sides.",

I also want prevention taken seriously through responsible education and access to contraception, because fewer crisis pregnancies is a goal people with very different convictions can share. Above all, the law should be humane and clear, focused on protecting life and strengthening families rather than turning fear and tragedy into punishment.",
    "165": "I want abortion laws that take seriously the value of unborn life while staying grounded in medical reality, so doctors can act quickly in emergencies and families aren\u2019t treated like criminals when things go wrong. The common thread I keep coming back to is fewer crises: invest in contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical support so choosing to carry a pregnancy is actually doable. If we can write clear, workable limits with compassionate exceptions and pair them with real help, we can protect dignity on all sides and lower the temperature.",
    "383": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a real respect for life\u2014meaning people can get safe, timely care and doctors aren\u2019t forced to hesitate when health or safety is on the line. I can\u2019t get behind politicians writing one-size-fits-all rules for situations that are often complicated and heartbreaking, but I do think we can unite around preventing unintended pregnancies with honest education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal and postpartum support. If we\u2019re serious about fewer abortions, we\u2019ve got to pair any legal guardrails with practical help\u2014healthcare, childcare, and stability\u2014so no one feels cornered into a decision because they\u2019re broke or alone. At the end of the day, I\u2019d rather see laws that reduce harm, protect privacy, and invest in families than ones that shame people when they\u2019re already having the worst day of their life."
