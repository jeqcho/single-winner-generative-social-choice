    "755": "I want abortion laws to be guided by compassion and real-life medical reality, keeping politicians out of exam rooms while recognizing that many people carry serious moral concerns about potential life. The common ground, to me, is making fewer people feel cornered in the first place\u2014through honest sex education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, mental-health, and childcare support\u2014so families can make decisions with dignity. Whatever limits exist, they should be clear, medically grounded, and always protect a person\u2019s health and safety without turning a crisis into a crime.",
    "685": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, privacy, and medical reality\u2014keeping politicians out of exam rooms while recognizing the moral weight many attach to developing life. In my own experience, durable rules are clear, workable, and focused on reducing harm: protect timely care (especially early and in emergencies), and pair it with real prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families\u2014cos\u00ec fewer people ever feel cornered into an impossible choice.",
    "443": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion and real medical facts, keeping private decisions mainly between a patient and their doctor, especially when health, safety, or severe complications are involved. At the same time, if we truly want fewer abortions, we should put our energy into prevention and support\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and help with childcare and basic needs\u2014so no one feels pushed into a decision by poverty or fear. Like tending a community garden, the best results come from investing early, strengthening what keeps families healthy, and avoiding policies that punish people in crisis.",
    "635": "I believe abortion laws should be guided first by a respect for human life and a sincere compassion for women and families who may be facing fear, violence, or medical crisis, with clear, humane exceptions when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at stake. The law should be steady and understandable, but it shouldn\u2019t replace the careful judgment of doctors or treat frightened people like criminals. The most honest common ground is working to prevent crisis pregnancies in the first place\u2014through responsible education, access to contraception, strong prenatal care, and real support for adoption and parenting\u2014so fewer families ever reach this painful crossroads.",
    "39": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal conscience\u2014keeping politicians out of the exam room while treating pregnancy and potential life with the seriousness it deserves. I favor protecting safe, timely care with clear exceptions when health is at risk and letting families and clinicians handle hard cases without fear of prosecution. If we want fewer abortions and less heartbreak, the most practical common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies and making it easier to carry and raise a child through contraception, honest education, healthcare, and real support for parents.",
    "561": "Laws on abortion should be guided by human dignity, compassion, and medical reality\u2014protecting a private space where patients and clinicians can make time\u2011sensitive decisions without fear, especially when health, violence, or devastating complications are involved. At the same time, I can\u2019t ignore the moral gravity many attach to developing life, which is why I favor clear, workable standards alongside major investments that prevent crisis pregnancies in the first place: honest education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical support for parenting and adoption. If we lead with humility instead of punishment, we can reduce abortions and suffering while respecting conscience in a pluralistic society.",
    "102": "I believe laws on abortion should be guided by a steady respect for human life and a real sense of mercy for people facing frightening, complicated pregnancies, with clear exceptions when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at risk. At the same time, I don\u2019t want politics to replace medical judgment, so the rules should be plain, workable, and aimed at fewer tragedies\u2014not punishment. The best common ground I see is pairing reasonable limits with practical help like prenatal care, adoption support, and community resources so fewer women feel alone or forced into a choice because they can\u2019t afford another mouth to feed.",
    "332": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, privacy, and medical evidence, so patients and clinicians\u2014not politicians\u2014can respond to real health risks and complex family circumstances without fear. At the same time, I hear the moral seriousness many attach to potential life, which is why I support clear, workable rules paired with strong prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, paid leave, and reliable help for families who choose to carry to term. If the shared goal is fewer crises and healthier outcomes, we\u2019ll get there faster by expanding real options and resources than by relying on punishment or shame.",
    "221": "I believe abortion law should treat unborn life with real moral seriousness while also recognizing that pregnancies can involve medical emergencies and heartbreaking complications, so the rules must be clear, humane, and leave room for physicians to act quickly to protect a woman\u2019s life and health. The most durable common ground is aiming for fewer abortions by preventing crisis pregnancies\u2014through responsible education, access to contraception, strong prenatal care, and practical support for adoption and parenting\u2014so decisions aren\u2019t driven by fear, isolation, or finances. If we can pair reasonable limits with compassion and concrete help, we can lower the temperature and write policy that protects dignity for everyone involved.",
    "392": "I want laws on abortion to be clear, humane, and grounded in medical reality\u2014protecting a person\u2019s health and privacy while also acknowledging the moral seriousness many people feel about developing life. To me, the most workable common ground is safeguarding urgent and early care with room for doctors\u2019 judgment in hard cases, and pairing that with real prevention and support: affordable contraception, honest education, strong prenatal care, and practical help for families. If policy focuses less on punishment and more on reducing crisis pregnancies and supporting parents and children, it lowers the temperature and leads to fewer tragedies overall.",
    "340": "Abortion law should start from a serious respect for developing human life while also being honest that pregnancies can involve medical emergencies, violence, or devastating diagnoses where families need timely care and clear, workable exceptions guided by doctors. I\u2019m drawn to policies that pair reasonable limits with real support\u2014accessible prenatal and postpartum care, adoption and foster-care improvements, contraception, and practical help for parents\u2014so fewer people feel cornered by fear, finances, or lack of options. Whatever lines we draw, the goal should be fewer abortions, safer outcomes, and less punishment and political theater around decisions that are already painful and personal.",
    "692": "I believe abortion law should start with a real respect for unborn life, but it also has to be written with mercy and clear medical exceptions so women and doctors aren\u2019t left guessing in emergencies or heartbreaking cases. If we want fewer abortions, the most honest path is to prevent crisis pregnancies and make it easier to choose birth through prenatal care, adoption support, and practical help that meets people where they are. We can disagree about where every line should be and still agree that shame and punishment don\u2019t build strong families\u2014steady rules, privacy, and real community support do.",
    "375": "I think abortion laws should be guided by individual freedom, medical reality, and compassion\u2014keeping politicians out of exam rooms while recognizing the moral weight many people attach to potential life. Like running a kitchen, clear rules matter, but they have to leave room for professional judgment in emergencies and the messy situations families actually face, with strong protections for a person\u2019s health, privacy, and timely care. The real common ground is prevention and support: better sex education, affordable contraception, solid prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for parents so fewer people feel cornered into a decision they never wanted.",
    "11": "I see abortion as a decision that carries real moral weight and real-world consequences, so laws should protect a pregnant person\u2019s health and privacy while keeping time-sensitive medical judgment in the hands of patients and clinicians, not politicians. At the same time, if we truly want fewer abortions, we should put serious effort into prevention and support\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help like childcare and paid leave\u2014so people aren\u2019t forced into choices by fear, money, or lack of options. The most humane path is clear, medically grounded rules with compassion in hard cases, paired with a community commitment to help families before and after a pregnancy.",
    "559": "I think abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a real respect for human life\u2014protecting a person\u2019s ability to make time-sensitive decisions with their doctor, especially when health, safety, or severe complications are involved, while setting clear, workable standards that don\u2019t change with politics. I can see the moral weight many attach to unborn life, which is why I support pairing whatever legal framework we choose with serious prevention and support: accurate education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for parents so fewer families ever feel cornered. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing crises and protecting dignity, we can lower the temperature and build rules more people can live with.",
    "730": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for conscience\u2014keeping politicians out of time\u2011sensitive decisions while recognizing the moral weight many people attach to potential life. I can live with clear, evidence\u2011based guardrails that protect access early and guarantee firm exceptions for rape, incest, and threats to a patient\u2019s life or health, so families and doctors aren\u2019t forced to gamble in a crisis. The best common ground is preventing the need for abortion in the first place through honest education, affordable contraception, and real support for pregnancy, birth, and parenting, because people make better choices when they aren\u2019t cornered by fear or finances.",
    "368": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a clear respect for privacy\u2014keeping urgent, complex decisions centered on patients and clinicians rather than politics\u2014while still acknowledging the moral seriousness many attach to potential life. I\u2019m persuaded that the most durable common ground is practical: protect access to safe care (especially early on and in medical emergencies), and put real effort into preventing crisis pregnancies through accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and meaningful support for parenting and adoption. If the goal is fewer tragedies and stronger families, the law should reduce harm, set clear medically grounded standards, and stop turning people in painful situations into targets.",
    "272": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, respect for life, and the reality that pregnancies can turn into urgent, complicated medical situations where families and clinicians need clear, safe options\u2014not fear of punishment. I\u2019m drawn to a framework that protects private decision-making early on, sets medically grounded guardrails later with firm exceptions for health and the hardest cases, and puts serious effort into prevention through honest education and easy access to contraception. If we want fewer abortions and stronger families, the law should pair any limits with real supports\u2014prenatal and postpartum care, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014so no one is pushed into a decision by cost, isolation, or lack of care.",
    "664": "I want abortion laws grounded in compassion, privacy, and real medical evidence\u2014firmly protecting health and safety while keeping politicians out of decisions that belong with patients, families, and clinicians. At the same time, I take seriously the moral weight many attach to potential life, which is why I\u2019d put the most effort into prevention and support: comprehensive education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal care, and practical help that makes parenting a real option. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing crisis pregnancies and hardship, we can lower harm, respect conscience, and cool the temperature on an issue that\u2019s been turned into a fight.",
    "745": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, privacy, and honest medical reality\u2014keeping urgent decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians, not politicians, while recognizing the moral seriousness many people attach to potential life. I\u2019m most persuaded by a practical middle path: protect safe, timely access early and in cases involving health risks or severe fetal complications, and pair any legal framework with real investments that prevent crisis pregnancies in the first place\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and meaningful support for parents. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing harm and expanding real options, we can lower the temperature and build policy that people with different convictions can live with.",
    "213": "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a serious respect for unborn life and an equally serious duty to protect a woman\u2019s life and health, with clear, medically workable rules that don\u2019t leave families or clinicians paralyzed in a crisis. I can\u2019t accept policies that lean on shame or punishment; real compassion means pairing reasonable limits and narrowly defined exceptions with practical support\u2014prenatal care, adoption help, and resources that make it possible to carry a pregnancy to term. If we focus on prevention and steadier support for mothers and children, we can lower the number of abortions and lower the temperature of a debate that has become too cruel and political.",
    "450": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a serious respect for the moral weight many people attach to developing life, with decisions kept as close as possible to the patient and qualified clinicians rather than politicians. I can support clear, medically grounded rules that protect health, privacy, and timely care\u2014especially in emergencies\u2014while recognizing that later-pregnancy cases are often rare and complex. The most durable common ground is prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families so fewer people ever face a crisis decision.",
    "120": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and privacy\u2014keeping time\u2011sensitive decisions primarily between a patient and their clinician, with clear protections for health and safety rather than political interference or punishment. At the same time, I take seriously that many people see moral value in developing life, which is why I support practical policies that measurably reduce unintended pregnancies and make it easier to carry a pregnancy to term: accurate education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal care, and real support for parents. If the shared goal is fewer crises and less suffering, we can write rules that are clear, humane, and focused on prevention and support instead of shame.",
    "728": "I don\u2019t want laws on abortion to be built around shame or political point-scoring; they should prioritize safety, privacy, and room for real medical judgment, especially when health or severe complications are involved. At the same time, I take seriously why many people feel a moral pull to protect developing life, which is why I\u2019d rather see a practical focus on prevention and support\u2014reliable sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, paid leave, and childcare\u2014so fewer families ever face this crisis. If we invest in healthier communities and real options, we can reduce abortions and suffering without turning people in tough situations into criminals.",
    "535": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical evidence, and privacy\u2014keeping urgent decisions between a patient and their doctor\u2014while also acknowledging the real moral weight many people attach to potential life. The most durable common ground, to me, is investing in what prevents crisis pregnancies in the first place: honest sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and mental-health care, and practical support like childcare and paid leave so no one feels forced by money or fear. Whatever limits exist should be clear, medically grounded, and include protections for health and safety, because punishment and stigma don\u2019t build healthier families or communities.",
    "527": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and the idea that these decisions belong as close as possible to the person and their doctor\u2014not politicians\u2014especially when health, safety, or severe complications are involved. At the same time, I hear the moral seriousness many people attach to potential life, and I think the most durable common ground is doing what actually prevents crises: accurate sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real help with childcare and stability so no one feels forced by money or fear. The goal should be fewer unwanted pregnancies, safer outcomes, and laws that protect privacy and dignity instead of turning families in crisis into targets.",
    "85": "I don\u2019t think abortion laws should be about shaming anyone or turning a complicated, time-sensitive medical situation into a political contest; they should protect safety, privacy, and room for doctors to use real medical judgment. At the same time, I can\u2019t ignore that many people see real moral weight in potential life, so I\u2019d rather focus on what actually prevents crisis pregnancies\u2014accurate sex education, affordable contraception, and solid prenatal and postpartum support. If the goal is fewer abortions and healthier families, then clear, medically grounded rules plus practical help for people who want to carry to term is the most humane middle ground I can see.",
    "813": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a respect for conscience\u2014keeping politicians out of the exam room while recognizing that many people carry sincere moral concern for developing life. I favor protecting private, timely care early in pregnancy, with clear, workable exceptions for threats to health and the hardest circumstances, and letting doctors use their judgment without fear. The surest common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place through honest education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, postpartum, and family supports so fewer people ever feel cornered into this decision.",
    "639": "I come at abortion law wanting clear, workable rules that respect human life while recognizing that real pregnancies can involve medical emergencies, violence, and heartbreaking complications where families need fast, medically guided decisions. The common ground I see is pairing reasonable limits and well-defined exceptions with serious investment in prevention and support\u2014responsible education, contraception, prenatal care, and adoption and parenting resources\u2014so fewer people ever feel trapped. If we keep politicians out of exam rooms but hold everyone to standards rooted in compassion, safety, and personal responsibility, we can lower the temperature and reduce suffering on all sides.",
    "625": "I want abortion laws to keep the focus on compassion, privacy, and medically grounded decision-making\u2014because real life is messy, and politicians can\u2019t script every crisis from far away. At the same time, I take seriously that many people see potential life as morally meaningful, which is why I\u2019d pair strong early access and clear health exceptions with practical steps that actually reduce unwanted pregnancies: accurate sex education, affordable contraception, and real support for prenatal care, childcare, and paid leave. If we\u2019re serious about fewer abortions and healthier families, we should stop centering punishment and start building conditions where people have genuine options and timely, safe care.",
    "661": "I believe laws on abortion should be guided by a serious respect for unborn life and a clear commitment to protect women in medical emergencies, written plainly enough that families and doctors aren\u2019t left guessing in a crisis. At the same time, I don\u2019t think punishment and politics solve this\u2014real prevention and real support do, like better access to prenatal care, adoption help that actually works, and practical resources for parents. If we focus on fewer unplanned pregnancies, fewer rushed decisions, and stronger help for moms and kids, we can argue less about slogans and more about outcomes most people can live with.",
    "457": "I\u2019ve learned over a lifetime that the hardest choices are rarely made lightly, and laws should be written with humility\u2014protecting a person\u2019s ability to make timely medical decisions with their doctor, especially when health, safety, or severe complications are involved, rather than turning crisis into punishment. At the same time, I hear the genuine moral concern for developing life, and I think the most honest common ground is to prevent as many desperate situations as possible through practical support: comprehensive education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real help for people raising children or pursuing adoption. If we center dignity, privacy, and measurable care instead of shame, we can lower the temperature and reduce harm for everyone.",
    "3": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a steady respect for human life, the health and dignity of the pregnant person, and the humility to keep politicians from overruling sound medical judgment when families are in a crisis. I can\u2019t see much good coming from punishment and chaos; the law ought to be clear about protections in emergencies and the hardest cases, and it ought to be matched with real prevention and support\u2014honest education, contraception, prenatal care, and practical help\u2014so fewer people are ever backed into that corner. Like caring for land and water, the goal should be fewer harms and more responsibility on the front end, not a scorched-earth fight that leaves communities poorer in mercy and trust.",
    "24": "Laws on abortion should be guided by respect for life and the seriousness of the decision, but also by compassion for families facing frightening medical or personal circumstances, so we don\u2019t turn crisis into punishment. I can support clear, medically grounded limits with firm exceptions when a mother\u2019s life or health is at risk and in rare, heartbreaking cases, while keeping doctors able to act without fear. The best common ground is working to prevent unwanted pregnancies and to offer real help\u2014prenatal care, counseling, adoption support, and practical resources\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into this choice.",
    "43": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a clear respect for personal privacy\u2014because in the real world these decisions are time-sensitive, emotionally loaded, and often tied to health, safety, and financial stability. I can also respect the moral weight many place on developing life, which is why I support policies that protect access early, preserve clinician judgment and emergency care, and keep later decisions grounded in medicine rather than politics. The most durable common ground is to reduce crisis pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical supports like paid leave and childcare, so fewer people are ever forced into an impossible choice.",
    "407": "I\u2019m guided by the belief that life is precious and that families should be encouraged and helped to choose life whenever possible, but I also don\u2019t want the law written in a way that turns a medical crisis into a courtroom or shames someone who is already scared. The most workable rules are clear and consistent, protect a mother\u2019s life and health with real medical judgment, and make room for the hardest cases, while pairing limits with practical support like prenatal care, adoption help, and resources that make raising a child doable. If we put less energy into punishment and more into prevention\u2014honest education and access to contraception\u2014there\u2019s a real chance to lower abortions and keep people from being cornered into desperate choices.",
    "197": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a respect for personal conscience\u2014keeping time\u2011sensitive decisions primarily between a patient and qualified clinicians, not politicians. I take seriously the moral weight many attach to potential life, but I\u2019ve also seen how shame, fear, and lack of support can turn a hard situation into a crisis, so the law should prioritize safety and clear health protections rather than punishment. Common ground is building a world with fewer unwanted pregnancies and fewer desperate choices through accurate education, accessible contraception, and strong prenatal, mental\u2011health, and family supports.",
    "220": "I\u2019ve learned from a lifetime of listening to people in my chair that big moral questions are never just arguments\u2014they\u2019re real lives, health scares, and hard budgets\u2014so abortion laws should protect privacy and safe medical care while treating the decision with gravity and compassion. I can respect the desire to value potential life and still believe politicians shouldn\u2019t be in the exam room; clear protections for a person\u2019s health, with room for medical judgment, matter. The strongest common ground is prevention and support: honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and practical help so fewer people ever feel trapped into any choice.",
    "551": "I want abortion laws to be rooted in compassion, medical reality, and privacy\u2014keeping time\u2011sensitive decisions primarily between a patient and their doctor, especially when health, safety, or severe complications are involved. At the same time, I hear the moral seriousness many people feel about potential life, and I think the most honest common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies and making it truly possible to choose parenting through affordable contraception, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, and childcare support. Laws should be clear and humane, protecting emergency care and informed consent without turning families in crisis or clinicians into criminals. If we focus less on punishment and more on support, dignity, and healthier outcomes for children and families, the temperature drops and the policy gets better.",
    "378": "I see abortion as a serious moral issue that also lands in the middle of real-life medical emergencies and family crises, so laws should be clear, humane, and written to protect both unborn life and a woman\u2019s health without turning desperate people into criminals. The most workable path is pairing reasonable limits and well-defined exceptions with practical prevention\u2014accurate education, access to contraception, and strong prenatal, adoption, and parenting support\u2014so fewer families ever feel cornered. If we keep politicians out of exam-room decisions while investing in the basics that make raising a child possible, we can lower the number of abortions and the temperature of the debate at the same time.",
    "194": "Laws on abortion should be guided by a sincere respect for human life and by compassion for the complicated, sometimes heartbreaking circumstances that surround pregnancy, with rules that are clear enough for families and doctors to follow without fear. I support reasonable, medically grounded limits that include firm exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and I also believe we\u2019ll reduce abortions more effectively by preventing crisis pregnancies through honest education, access to contraception, prenatal care, and meaningful support for parenting and adoption. If we keep the focus on responsibility, mercy, and practical help instead of punishment or politics, more people can live with the outcome even when they disagree on where every line should be drawn.",
    "738": "Abortion laws should be guided by a mix of personal freedom, basic respect for developing life, and the reality that medical emergencies don\u2019t wait for politics to catch up. Like turning wrenches on an old diesel, you need clear safety standards but enough flexibility for the mechanic on the spot\u2014so decisions stay mainly between the patient and doctor, with clear exceptions for life and serious health risks and workable, medically grounded limits later on. If we actually want fewer abortions, the most effective \u201cmaintenance schedule\u201d is prevention and support: straightforward sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal care, and practical help so nobody feels pushed into a choice by money, fear, or being alone.",
    "742": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a clear respect for privacy\u2014keeping urgent, time-sensitive decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians rather than politicians. At the same time, I hear the moral seriousness many attach to potential life, which is why I support straightforward, medically grounded rules that protect health and allow for difficult circumstances while focusing our biggest energy on prevention. If we want fewer abortions and stronger families, the most effective common ground is expanding contraception and accurate education, and making it financially and practically possible to carry a pregnancy to term through prenatal care, childcare, and paid leave.",
    "778": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, privacy, and clear medical reality\u2014trusting patients and clinicians to handle time-sensitive decisions, especially when health, safety, or devastating complications are involved, instead of turning a crisis into a courtroom. At the same time, I take seriously why many people feel moral weight here, which is why I\u2019d pair legal access (especially early in pregnancy) with real investments that prevent unwanted pregnancies and support families: accurate sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, paid leave, childcare, and better adoption and foster systems. If the shared goal is fewer tragedies and healthier families, the law should reduce harm and expand real options rather than shame, confusion, or punishment.",
    "295": "I\u2019ve seen up close that pregnancy and medical crises don\u2019t follow neat timelines, so laws should protect patient safety, privacy, and the ability for a person and their clinician to act quickly\u2014especially when health is at risk\u2014without turning care into a courtroom. At the same time, I respect that many people feel a real moral weight about potential life, which is why I favor clear, medically grounded rules paired with serious investments in prevention and support: contraception, honest education, prenatal/postpartum care, and practical help for parenting or adoption. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing unwanted pregnancies and protecting health, we can lower the temperature and reduce harm even when we don\u2019t agree on every line.",
    "472": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for privacy\u2014keeping politicians out of time\u2011sensitive healthcare decisions\u2014while still acknowledging the moral weight many people feel about developing life. I\u2019d rather see policy reduce the number of abortions by preventing crisis pregnancies through honest sex education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, postpartum, and mental\u2011health care, plus real support for parenting and adoption. Clear protections for a pregnant person\u2019s health and for clinicians\u2019 ability to use their judgment are essential, because one-size-fits-all rules don\u2019t match real life. If we focus less on punishment and more on practical help that makes families healthier and communities stronger, there\u2019s room for people with different beliefs to live with the same framework.",
    "185": "I think abortion laws should be guided by compassion, privacy, and solid medical evidence, because real-life pregnancies come with health risks, time pressure, and family realities that politicians can\u2019t predict. I can respect that many people feel a serious moral responsibility to protect potential life, but I don\u2019t believe the answer is punishment or forcing one set of beliefs on everyone\u2014especially when it can make care unsafe. The common ground I see is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place with accurate sex education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, childcare, and economic supports so people aren\u2019t choosing under fear or financial stress. If we focus on safety, dignity, and real options for families, we can lower harm and lower the temperature at the same time.",
    "783": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal freedom\u2014because the people living through a pregnancy are the ones carrying the risks, the costs, and the consequences, and politicians can\u2019t write a one-size-fits-all rule for a crisis. I can take seriously the moral weight many people feel about potential life while still believing decisions belong primarily with the pregnant person and their doctor, with clear protections for health, safety, and privacy. If we want fewer abortions and healthier families, the most honest common ground is prevention and support: accurate sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical resources like childcare and paid leave so no one is forced by fear or finances.",
    "300": "I believe laws on abortion should be guided by a real respect for unborn life and by compassion for women facing scary, complicated situations, with clear, workable exceptions when a mother\u2019s life or health is at risk and in the hardest cases like rape or incest. I also think we\u2019d prevent more heartbreak by putting more effort into what helps before anyone reaches that point\u2014honest education, access to contraception, strong prenatal care, and practical support so choosing to carry a pregnancy isn\u2019t made impossible by money or being alone. The goal should be fewer abortions and less suffering, without turning patients and doctors into criminals or treating a family crisis like a political trophy. If we keep the rules steady and the tone humane, there\u2019s room for people of good faith to disagree and still protect both life and dignity.",
    "121": "I approach abortion law the way I\u2019ve always approached high\u2011stakes decisions: set clear, workable rules that reflect respect for unborn life, but don\u2019t pretend one rigid standard can cover medical emergencies and heartbreaking cases where a doctor\u2019s judgment and a family\u2019s conscience have to matter.

    "364": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a sober respect for the moral weight many people feel, with decisions kept as close as possible to the patient and their doctor\u2014especially when health, safety, or severe fetal complications are involved. Having spent years trying to set fair, workable rules for diverse families, I\u2019ve learned that rigid one-size-fits-all mandates often create more harm than clarity, so the law should protect privacy and timely care while drawing any limits carefully and honestly. The best common ground is reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies and crisis decisions through accurate education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real support for parenting and adoption, so fewer people are forced into impossible choices."
