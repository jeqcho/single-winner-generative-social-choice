    "228": "Abortion laws should be grounded in respect for human life and personal responsibility, while also being honest about the medical emergencies and heartbreaking circumstances that don\u2019t fit tidy rules. I want clear, workable limits that increase as pregnancy progresses, with straightforward exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and for cases of rape or incest\u2014so doctors can act without fear and families aren\u2019t trapped in red tape. The best common ground, to me, is pairing any legal line with real, practical support that reduces crisis pregnancies in the first place: accessible prenatal care, contraception, adoption options, and meaningful help for parents who choose to carry to term.",
    "99": "I take the value of unborn life seriously, but I also don\u2019t want laws so rigid that they block doctors from acting fast in medical emergencies or treat families in crisis like criminals. A workable approach is clear limits that tighten as pregnancy progresses, with straightforward exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and for situations like rape or incest. Just as important, the focus should be on preventing unwanted pregnancies and supporting parents\u2014access to contraception, solid prenatal care, adoption help, and real resources after birth\u2014so fewer people ever feel cornered into this decision.",
    "611": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical reality, and privacy\u2014keeping urgent decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians rather than politicians\u2014while still acknowledging the moral seriousness many people attach to potential life. From working in community programs and raising a family, I\u2019ve seen that fewer people end up in crisis when we invest in prevention and stability: honest sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and maternal care, paid leave, childcare, and support for adoption and parenting. If we focus on reducing harm and expanding real options instead of punishment and slogans, we can protect health and dignity while lowering the number of unwanted pregnancies.",
    "262": "I\u2019ve come to believe abortion laws should be guided by respect for life and family, but also by compassion and medical reality, because pregnancies don\u2019t always go as planned and hard cases need clear, workable exceptions when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at risk. The government shouldn\u2019t replace a doctor\u2019s judgment, and the law should avoid punishing people in crisis while still setting responsible boundaries that many communities can live with. The strongest common ground is to prevent unwanted pregnancies and reduce pressure on families by expanding honest education, access to contraception, prenatal care, and real support for parents and adoption.",
    "271": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and privacy\u2014keeping time-sensitive decisions between a patient and their clinician, with clear protections when health or life is at risk and no criminal penalties that make care less safe. At the same time, I take seriously why many people feel moral weight around potential life, which is why I want any legal framework paired with what actually prevents crisis: affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real support so carrying a pregnancy is a genuine option. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing harm and expanding choices, we can lower abortions and protect dignity even when we disagree.",
    "758": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for conscience\u2014keeping urgent decisions between a patient and a doctor, not politicians\u2014while taking seriously why many people feel a duty to protect potential life. The common ground I see is making sure there are clear exceptions for health emergencies and hard cases, and putting real support on the table so fewer families feel trapped: affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal care, and help after birth. A law that reduces harm, avoids punishment, and gives working families real options is the most practical way to lower abortions and lower the temperature.",
    "130": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and the basic idea that families deserve privacy to make time-sensitive decisions with qualified doctors, especially when health, rape, or severe fetal complications are involved. At the same time, I take seriously why many people feel a moral duty to protect developing life, so any framework should put real weight on prevention and support\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help that makes parenting or adoption a genuine option. If we focus less on punishment and slogans and more on reducing crises and strengthening families, there\u2019s room for a durable compromise that keeps people safe and treated with dignity.",
    "402": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a respect for individual freedom and conscience, keeping time-sensitive decisions primarily between a patient and their doctor rather than politicians. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many people feel about potential life, which is why I support a practical framework with clear health and emergency exceptions and a focus on prevention. The surest common ground is investing in what reduces crisis in the first place\u2014reliable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real support like childcare and paid leave\u2014so families aren\u2019t forced into choices by fear, money, or lack of options.",
    "421": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a respect for privacy, because decisions made under fear, trauma, or medical uncertainty go better when patients and clinicians\u2014not politicians\u2014can act promptly and safely. At the same time, I take seriously that many people experience pregnancy as morally weighty, so any durable framework should pair legal access (with clear, workable health exceptions) with strong prevention and support: comprehensive education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and real help for families who choose to carry to term. If we focus on reducing harm and reducing unwanted pregnancies\u2014rather than punishing people in crisis\u2014we can protect dignity and life in a way more of us can live with.",
    "65": "I take the moral weight of abortion seriously, and I also don\u2019t want laws written so rigidly that they trap families and clinicians in emergencies or tragedies. The best legal framework, in my view, sets clear, workable limits that increase as pregnancy progresses, with unambiguous exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and for cases like rape or incest, while keeping the focus on safety and medical judgment rather than punishment. Common ground is treating fewer abortions and healthier families as the shared goal\u2014backed by real support like contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, adoption resources, and practical help for parents so fewer people feel cornered into an impossible choice.",
    "305": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for privacy, keeping decisions as close as possible to the person who is pregnant and their doctor, especially when health or safety is at stake. At the same time, I can\u2019t ignore that many people feel a deep moral responsibility toward potential life, so any legal framework should be paired with real prevention and support\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and maternal care, and practical help for families who choose to carry to term. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing crises and strengthening families, we can protect dignity while lowering the number of unwanted pregnancies.",
    "495": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and privacy\u2014keeping decisions as close as possible to a patient and their clinician\u2014while acknowledging that many people experience this as a morally serious question about potential life. Any framework should clearly protect care in emergencies, severe fetal conditions, and cases of rape or incest, and it should avoid criminalizing patients or clinicians when time-sensitive judgment is needed. The most durable common ground is prevention and support: accurate education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families so fewer people ever feel cornered into this decision.",
    "306": "I want abortion laws that keep people safe and give them room to make time-sensitive medical decisions with their doctor, without fear of politicians or prosecutors getting in the way\u2014especially when health is on the line or in cases like rape or severe fetal complications. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss how morally serious pregnancy feels to many people, which is why I think the most durable approach is fewer unwanted pregnancies through honest sex education, affordable contraception, and real support like prenatal care and childcare so choosing to carry a pregnancy is actually possible. If we center prevention, privacy, and practical help instead of punishment, we can lower the temperature and reduce harm even when we disagree about where the legal line should be.",
    "19": "I believe abortion laws should keep time-sensitive medical decisions between a pregnant person and their doctor, with clear protections for health, privacy, and emergencies, because rigid rules tend to hit hardest when someone is already in a crisis. At the same time, I take seriously that many people see potential life as morally important, so the goal shouldn\u2019t be punishment but fewer desperate situations\u2014through affordable contraception, honest sex education, and real support like prenatal care and help after birth. If we lead with compassion and practical help instead of shame and politics, we can protect dignity while lowering the number of unwanted pregnancies.",
    "416": "I want laws on abortion to be guided by compassion, privacy, and medical reality, keeping decisions primarily between a patient and their doctor\u2014especially when health, rape, or severe fetal complications are involved\u2014rather than turning a crisis into a courtroom. At the same time, I can\u2019t dismiss the moral gravity many feel about potential life, so I support practical steps that actually reduce unwanted pregnancies: honest sex education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, postpartum, and parenting supports. To me, the common ground is a policy that avoids punishment, protects safety and dignity, and backs up any moral talk with real help for people who choose to carry a pregnancy to term.",
    "663": "I believe laws on abortion should start with a deep respect for unborn life, while also being honest that pregnancies can bring medical emergencies and heartbreaking circumstances where doctors need the freedom to act quickly to protect a mother\u2019s life and serious health. If we want fewer abortions and less bitterness, we should pair any limits with real, practical support\u2014prenatal and postpartum care, adoption resources, and help for families\u2014so choosing life is truly possible and no one is left alone. In the end, mercy and responsibility have to go together: clear rules, workable exceptions, and a community that shows up with more than words.",
    "593": "I want abortion laws to be grounded in medical reality, privacy, and compassion, because one-size-fits-all rules don\u2019t hold up when real pregnancies involve health risks, trauma, or suddenly unstable life circumstances. At the same time, I take seriously why many people feel a moral obligation toward potential life, which is why I support an approach that keeps early care safe and accessible, preserves clear exceptions for life and health, and treats later decisions with clinical judgment rather than politics. The most honest common ground is prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help with childcare and stability so fewer people ever feel cornered into this decision.",
    "295": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a clear respect for privacy\u2014because pregnancy can turn complicated fast, and care works best when patients and clinicians can act without fear or delay. I can also respect that many people feel a deep moral responsibility toward developing life, which is why any legal framework should be paired with serious prevention and support: reliable contraception, honest education, strong prenatal and maternal care, and practical help for parents who choose to carry to term. If we focus less on punishment and politics and more on reducing crises and protecting health, there\u2019s room for a humane middle that people of different convictions can live with.",
    "742": "Abortion laws should be guided by patient safety, medical evidence, and respect for private decision-making, because pregnancy can turn complicated quickly and rigid rules can delay care when minutes matter. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral seriousness many people feel about potential life, so any durable approach should put real energy into prevention and support\u2014affordable contraception, honest education, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help that makes parenting a real option. If we focus less on punishment and more on reducing crises and protecting health, we can lower the number of abortions while treating families and clinicians with dignity.",
    "464": "I believe laws on abortion should start with a real respect for unborn life, but they also have to be clear, workable, and compassionate enough to let doctors act quickly in true medical emergencies and other heartbreaking situations. What I keep coming back to is that we\u2019ll prevent more suffering by pairing any limits with practical support\u2014reliable prenatal care, counseling, adoption help, and steady resources for mothers after birth\u2014so choosing life doesn\u2019t feel like being left to fend for yourself. If we focus on prevention, personal responsibility, and real help for families instead of punishment and politics, we can protect the vulnerable and lower the temperature at the same time.",
    "697": "I want abortion laws to be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for personal conscience\u2014keeping decisions primarily between a patient and their clinician, with clear protections when someone\u2019s life or health is at risk and workable rules that don\u2019t trap people in fear or paperwork. At the same time, I hear the moral seriousness many attach to potential life, and I think the most honest common ground is preventing crisis in the first place through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and real support like prenatal care, paid leave, childcare, and stable housing. If we invest in people\u2019s ability to build secure, sustainable lives, fewer pregnancies will feel like emergencies, and the law can focus on safety, dignity, and practical help rather than punishment.",
    "342": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and privacy\u2014keeping urgent, deeply personal decisions between a patient and their clinician rather than politicians\u2014while still acknowledging that many people feel a genuine moral responsibility toward potential life. To bridge divides, I\u2019d protect safe, timely access with clear exceptions for health emergencies, rape, and severe fetal complications, and pair any legal framework with real prevention and support: affordable contraception, straightforward education, strong prenatal and maternal care, and practical help that makes parenting or adoption a viable option. If we focus on reducing crises and expanding real choices instead of punishment, we can lower harm and make room for people of good faith to live together even when they disagree.",
    "525": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a respect for conscience\u2014because when a pregnancy turns complicated, politicians aren\u2019t the ones in the exam room dealing with the risk, the grief, or the fallout. I can take seriously the value many people place on potential life and still believe the law has to protect safe, timely care with clear exceptions for health emergencies, rape, and severe fetal complications, without criminalizing patients or doctors. If we want fewer abortions, the honest work is prevention and support: affordable contraception, straightforward sex education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real help for families so nobody is pushed into a decision by fear, poverty, or lack of options.",
    "366": "Abortion law should be guided by evidence-based medicine, privacy, and compassion, because pregnancy can turn into an acute situation fast and rigid rules can delay clinically indicated care and increase morbidity. I can also acknowledge the moral gravity many people feel about potential life, which is why I support a framework that keeps early care accessible, builds in clear exceptions for life-threatening or serious health risks, rape/incest, and severe fetal anomalies, and avoids criminalizing patients or clinicians. The most durable common ground is upstream: comprehensive sex ed, affordable contraception, prenatal/postpartum care, paid leave, and childcare\u2014real supports that reduce unintended pregnancies and make choosing to continue a pregnancy genuinely feasible.",
    "762": "I don\u2019t take abortion lightly, and I want laws that respect unborn life while also being honest about the messy reality of pregnancy complications and crisis situations where doctors need clear room to act quickly to protect a woman\u2019s life and serious health. The most workable path, to me, is straightforward limits that reflect growing moral concern as a pregnancy progresses, paired with real, practical help that prevents unplanned pregnancies and supports women who choose to carry\u2014accessible contraception, solid prenatal care, and adoption and community resources. If we focus less on punishing people and more on responsibility, compassion, and clear medical standards, we can protect more life and lower the temperature at the same time.",
    "411": "I\u2019m guided by a conviction that human life is precious, and also by a sober awareness that pregnancies can involve medical emergencies and heartbreaking circumstances that don\u2019t fit tidy legal formulas. The law should set clear, workable guardrails that protect unborn life while ensuring unambiguous exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and it should avoid criminalizing patients or tying clinicians\u2019 hands in time-sensitive care. The strongest common ground is pairing any limits with real efforts to prevent unwanted pregnancies and to support women and families\u2014good prenatal care, responsible counseling, adoption support, and practical help\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into this decision.",
    "680": "I want abortion laws to be guided by compassion, privacy, and medical reality\u2014keeping time-sensitive decisions centered on the person who\u2019s pregnant and their doctor, with clear protections when health or safety is at risk. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many people feel about potential life, which is why I support practical, workable limits later in pregnancy that still leave room for urgent exceptions and clinician judgment. The most honest common ground is prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and real help with childcare and finances so fewer people ever feel cornered into this decision.",
    "679": "I approach abortion law the way I approach a tough repair: be honest about the moral weight of ending a pregnancy, but write rules that work in the real world and don\u2019t turn medical emergencies into paperwork and fear. I can support reasonable limits that increase later in pregnancy, with clear, usable exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, rape or incest, and severe fetal complications, while keeping doctors free to act quickly. If we actually want fewer abortions and stronger families, the most practical common ground is prevention and support\u2014straightforward access to contraception, solid prenatal and postpartum care, and real help for parents so no one feels cornered.",
    "64": "I want laws that keep abortion decisions grounded in medical evidence, privacy, and the realities families face, with clear protections so doctors can act quickly when health, rape, or severe fetal complications are involved. At the same time, I take seriously that many people see potential life as morally weighty, which is why any legal framework should be paired with practical prevention and support\u2014affordable contraception, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real help for parents. When policy is precise, humane, and focused on reducing crisis rather than punishment, it becomes easier to lower the number of unwanted pregnancies while respecting conscience and protecting health.",
    "793": "I look at abortion law the way I look at a jobsite plan: it needs clear guardrails, workable language, and enough flexibility for emergencies, because real life never follows a perfect set of drawings. I want limits that reflect respect for unborn life, with straightforward exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to the mother\u2019s life or health, so doctors aren\u2019t forced to wait until things go sideways. The best common ground is to pair any legal line with prevention and support\u2014contraception access, honest education, prenatal care, and practical help for families\u2014so fewer people end up facing this decision in the first place.",
    "485": "I want abortion law to be grounded in compassion, medical evidence, and privacy, because pregnancy can involve urgent, complicated realities that aren\u2019t helped by political delay or fear. At the same time, I take seriously why many people feel a moral duty to protect potential life, which is why I support a framework that keeps early care accessible, ensures clear and workable exceptions for health emergencies and traumatic cases, and relies on clinicians\u2019 judgment rather than criminal penalties. The most durable common ground, to me, is reducing the number of people forced into crisis by expanding contraception and comprehensive education, and by backing up any talk of \u201cchoice\u201d with real support like prenatal care, paid leave, childcare, and adoption resources.",
    "408": "I\u2019m guided by a respect for life and personal responsibility, but also by the reality that pregnancies can turn complicated fast, so the law has to be clear, medically workable, and make room for urgent exceptions when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at risk, and in cases like rape or incest. The most durable common ground is aiming for fewer abortions by putting real support on the table\u2014accessible contraception, strong prenatal and maternal care, and practical help for families and adoption\u2014so people aren\u2019t pushed into crisis choices. If we keep politics from overriding doctors and focus on prevention and support instead of punishment, we can protect dignity while lowering the number of abortions.",
    "433": "I want abortion laws guided by patient safety, medical evidence, and the reality that pregnancy can change fast, so decisions stay primarily between a person and their clinician\u2014without fear of punishment or political delay\u2014especially when health, rape, or severe fetal complications are involved. At the same time, I take seriously why many people feel a moral obligation toward developing life, which is why I support policies that reduce unintended pregnancies and make carrying a pregnancy truly feasible through contraception access, comprehensive education, prenatal care, paid leave, and childcare support. If we focus less on winning arguments and more on preventing crises and backing families in real, practical ways, we can lower harm and find a durable middle ground.",
    "783": "I want laws on abortion to be guided by compassion, medical reality, and the basic principle that private healthcare decisions should stay with the person who\u2019s pregnant and their clinician\u2014not politicians\u2014especially when health, rape, or severe fetal complications are involved. At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral weight many place on potential life, which is why I think the most durable path is prevention and support: honest sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real help with housing, childcare, and paid leave. If we\u2019re serious about fewer abortions and healthier families, we should stop criminalizing people in crisis and start building the conditions where every pregnancy is met with genuine options and dignity.",

At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral seriousness many attach to potential life, which is why I want policy to put real effort into prevention and support\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families. If we focus on reducing crises and widening genuine options rather than punishing people in their hardest moments, we can protect dignity and health while lowering the number of unwanted pregnancies.",
    "618": "I see abortion as morally serious and I want laws that respect developing life, but I also don\u2019t want politicians writing rigid rules that trap families and doctors in medical crises. The most workable approach is clear, medically grounded limits that become stricter as pregnancy progresses, paired with straightforward exceptions for threats to the mother\u2019s life and health and for rape or incest. Common ground comes from prevention and support: make contraception and accurate education widely available, and back any legal framework with prenatal care, adoption resources, and practical help so fewer people feel cornered into this decision.",
    "385": "I\u2019ve spent a lot of time around everyday working people, and I\u2019ve learned that when life throws a crisis at you, you need clear rules that actually work and let medical professionals act quickly, not laws that turn a hard moment into a legal trap. For me, abortion policy should protect privacy and safety early in pregnancy, allow straightforward exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to health, and avoid criminalizing patients or doctors. The most durable common ground is to pair any limits with real prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal care, and practical help for families\u2014so fewer people ever face this decision in the first place.",
    "70": "Abortion is morally serious to me because I believe unborn life deserves protection, but I also know hard medical realities and family crises don\u2019t fit slogans, so laws should be clear, workable, and centered on safety rather than punishment. I can support reasonable limits that increase with pregnancy, paired with straightforward exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and for rape or incest, so doctors can act without delay.

At the same time, I don\u2019t dismiss the moral seriousness many feel about potential life, which is why I want our communities to put real weight behind prevention and support: honest education, reliable contraception, prenatal care, and practical help for families who choose to carry a pregnancy. If we focus less on punishment and politics and more on reducing crises and caring for people, we can protect dignity while lowering the number of abortions over time.",
    "710": "I believe laws on abortion should reflect both the seriousness of ending a potential life and the reality that pregnancies can turn into medical and personal crises that don\u2019t fit political talking points.

The surest common ground, to me, is putting real help on the table: contraception that people can afford, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and practical support for parenting or adoption so fewer women ever feel trapped.

I also believe we can lower the number of abortions and cool the politics by investing in what nearly everyone says they want\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and maternal care, and real support for families and adoption.

To my mind, the common ground is simple: fewer crises, healthier families, and laws that are clear, workable, and humane\u2014because when the chips are down, people need care, not shame.",
    "656": "I\u2019ve spent enough time around patients and families in crisis to know that pregnancy can turn from joyful to dangerous or heartbreaking in a hurry, so abortion laws should be clear, medically workable, and never delay care when a mother\u2019s life or serious health is at risk. At the same time, I can\u2019t shrug off the moral weight many feel about unborn life, which is why I support reasonable limits that grow stricter later in pregnancy, paired with straightforward exceptions for rape, incest, and severe fetal complications.

At the same time, I take seriously why many people feel moral responsibility toward potential life, which is why I can support a practical framework that protects access early on, keeps clear health and trauma exceptions, and avoids criminalizing patients or providers. The most durable common ground is prevention and support\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and postpartum care, and real economic help\u2014so fewer families ever feel trapped by circumstance. If we center dignity and care over punishment and politics, we can lower harm and lower the temperature.",
    "46": "I want abortion laws guided by evidence-based medicine, privacy, and compassion, because pregnancy isn\u2019t a theoretical debate\u2014it\u2019s a time-sensitive clinical reality where rigid rules can delay care and increase harm. At the same time, I take seriously that many people feel a moral duty to protect potential life, so I\u2019m open to clear, workable guardrails that grow stricter later in pregnancy as long as they include unambiguous exceptions for health, rape/incest, and severe fetal complications and don\u2019t criminalize patients or clinicians. The most durable common ground is prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical resources that make parenting or adoption a real option rather than a slogan."
