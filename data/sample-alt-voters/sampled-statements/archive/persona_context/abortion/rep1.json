    "523": "I believe abortion laws should start from respect for human life, but also be written with enough compassion and clarity that people can get timely medical care in emergencies without doctors or families second-guessing the law. I can support reasonable limits with clear exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and I also think we\u2019d lower abortions more by preventing crisis pregnancies\u2014better access to contraception, honest education, and real support for parents and adoption\u2014than by punishment. If we keep politics out of the exam room and focus on responsibility, safety, and practical help, more people can live with the lines we draw even when we disagree.",
    "483": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for personal autonomy, keeping politicians out of exam rooms while ensuring care is safe, timely, and based on evidence. I also don\u2019t want to dismiss the moral weight many people feel about developing life, so any legal framework should be clear, avoid criminalizing patients or clinicians acting in good faith, and focus on reducing harm. The strongest common ground is preventing unintended pregnancies and making it genuinely easier to carry a pregnancy to term through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and real support for parents and children.",
    "655": "I want abortion laws that keep patients safe and decisions anchored in medical evidence and privacy, because real life doesn\u2019t fit one-size-fits-all rules and delays can turn a crisis into a tragedy. At the same time, I respect that many people feel a serious moral responsibility toward developing life, so I\u2019m drawn to clear, workable standards that protect health while avoiding criminalizing patients or doctors. The strongest common ground is preventing unwanted pregnancies through straightforward education and reliable contraception, and backing families with prenatal care, childcare, and paid leave so fewer people feel cornered into any choice.",
    "555": "I want laws that start with a real respect for unborn life while also being honest about how messy and frightening pregnancy complications can be, so doctors can act quickly in true medical emergencies and families aren\u2019t left guessing. Clear limits with narrowly defined, workable exceptions for life-threatening situations (and tragedies like rape or incest) feel more humane and enforceable than blanket bans or anything that treats abortion as casual. Where I see the most common ground is in preventing crises in the first place\u2014better sex education, easier access to contraception, and stronger support for pregnancy, adoption, and parenting so fewer people feel cornered into a choice.",
    "298": "Laws on abortion should keep the government from micromanaging private medical decisions while still treating the choice with the seriousness it deserves, especially when health is on the line. I can respect the impulse to protect potential life, but I don\u2019t want families and doctors threatened with criminal penalties for handling complicated, real-world situations. The best common ground is fewer unintended pregnancies through straightforward education and easy access to contraception, plus real support for parents and adoption so more people have workable options instead of panic-driven ones.",
    "685": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for personal conscience\u2014keeping politicians out of exam rooms while ensuring timely, safe care and clear protections for patients and clinicians. I can appreciate the moral weight many place on potential life, which is why I also want serious investment in prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and practical help for families and adoption so fewer people ever reach this crossroads. The goal, in pratica, should be fewer crises and less suffering\u2014rules that are humane, workable, and grounded in dignity rather than punishment.",
    "407": "Abortion laws should start with respect for unborn life, but they also have to face real life honestly, with clear exceptions for rape, incest, and serious danger to the mother so doctors can act fast without fear. I\u2019m drawn to rules that are firm but humane, paired with practical support\u2014prenatal care, adoption options, and real help for parents\u2014so choosing to carry a pregnancy isn\u2019t just a moral demand but a workable path. If we put less energy into punishment and politics and more into prevention through education and contraception, we can reduce abortions while treating families in crisis with dignity.",
    "112": "I believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and a steady respect for both human dignity and the moral weight many attach to potential life\u2014written clearly enough that doctors can act fast in emergencies and families aren\u2019t left guessing. Decisions should stay as close as possible to the patient and qualified clinicians, with straightforward exceptions for serious health threats, rape, incest, and nonviable pregnancies, and without turning people in crisis into criminals. If we want fewer abortions and stronger families, we should put real resources on the objective\u2014education, contraception access, prenatal care, mental health support, and practical help for parents and adoption\u2014so fewer people ever reach that breaking point.",
    "425": "I want abortion laws to be guided by medical evidence, privacy, and compassion, because real life doesn\u2019t follow neat timelines and people need timely care without fear of punishment for themselves or their doctors. At the same time, I take seriously why many people feel a duty to protect potential life, which is why I support clear, workable standards that prioritize health and safety and avoid political guesswork in emergencies. The most durable common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place through comprehensive education, affordable contraception, and practical support like prenatal care, paid leave, and childcare so decisions are driven less by desperation and more by real choice.",
    "271": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and the freedom to make time-sensitive decisions privately with a qualified clinician, not fear of punishment. I also hear the genuine moral concern many people feel about potential life, and I think the most unifying approach is to prevent crisis pregnancies with honest education and affordable contraception, and to back up families with prenatal care, paid leave, childcare, and adoption support. Clear rules should always protect emergency care, and the tone of the law should protect dignity\u2014because real life is messy, and nobody should be forced into danger or desperation.",
    "788": "I\u2019m guided by a respect for human life and a belief that most people facing this choice aren\u2019t looking for an easy way out\u2014they\u2019re trying to do what they can in a hard situation. The law should set clear limits that value the unborn while also providing workable, compassionate exceptions for serious medical danger, rape, and incest, so families and doctors aren\u2019t paralyzed in a crisis. At the same time, the best way to reduce abortions is to prevent desperation in the first place with practical support like prenatal care, adoption resources, and real help for parents, paired with honest education and access to contraception.",
    "653": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, clear medical facts, and the idea that these decisions belong as close as possible to the patient and their doctor\u2014especially when health, safety, or trauma are involved\u2014without turning desperate situations into crimes. At the same time, I don\u2019t think society can ignore the moral weight many people feel about unborn life, so any rules should be written plainly with humane exceptions and without political games. The biggest common ground is prevention and real support: better sex education, affordable contraception, and practical help like prenatal care, childcare, and adoption services so fewer people ever feel cornered into this choice.",
    "35": "Abortion is a serious moral issue, and laws should show real respect for unborn life while also making sure families can get timely medical care in emergencies without fear or confusion. I can support clear limits with compassionate, well-defined exceptions for situations like threats to the mother\u2019s life, rape, or severe complications, and I want the focus to be on prevention and practical help\u2014prenatal care, counseling, adoption support, and resources so no one feels pushed into a desperate choice. If we invest more in strengthening families and reducing unintended pregnancies, we can lower the number of abortions and treat people with dignity instead of turning crisis into punishment.",
    "392": "I want abortion laws that take the moral weight of potential life seriously while keeping real-world medical decisions private, timely, and guided by doctors\u2014especially when someone\u2019s health is at risk or a pregnancy involves violence or severe complications. To me, the most practical common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place with honest education, affordable contraception, and clear, consistent rules that don\u2019t criminalize people in fear. And if society asks anyone to carry a pregnancy to term, it should also show up with prenatal care, counseling, adoption support, and the basic resources that make choosing life genuinely possible.",
    "147": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a clear respect for personal autonomy, because real families face situations that don\u2019t fit tidy rules and no one should be pushed into danger or shame to get care. At the same time, I take seriously the moral weight many attach to developing life, which is why I support policies that prevent crises in the first place\u2014honest education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal care, and practical support for parenting or adoption. If we keep politicians out of exam rooms, protect patient and clinician safety, and invest in the conditions that make raising a child truly possible, we can lower the number of unwanted pregnancies while preserving dignity and freedom in the hardest moments.",
    "107": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a respect for privacy, because real-life pregnancies can involve crisis, danger, and circumstances that don\u2019t fit a slogan or a statute. I believe the government\u2019s role is to set clear, workable standards that protect patient safety and allow doctors to act quickly\u2014especially when health is at risk\u2014without turning families in distress into criminals. If we want fewer abortions and healthier communities, the most durable common ground is prevention and support: honest education, affordable contraception, and real help for parents and children so people have options before they reach a breaking point.",
    "621": "Abortion laws should begin with a real respect for unborn life, but they also have to be written plainly enough that doctors can act fast in true emergencies and women aren\u2019t left navigating fear and confusion. I can support firm limits with clear, narrowly defined exceptions for life-threatening situations and cases like rape or incest, while putting more effort into what actually reduces abortions: responsible education, accessible contraception, prenatal care, and practical support for parenting and adoption. If we\u2019re serious about dignity and responsibility, we should stop treating this like a political trophy and focus on fewer crises, safer care, and stronger support for mothers and children.",
    "299": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for privacy, because real life doesn\u2019t follow a script and people deserve the ability to make time-sensitive healthcare decisions with their doctors without fear or stigma. At the same time, I can honor the moral weight many feel by supporting practical steps that prevent crisis pregnancies in the first place\u2014reliable sex education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, mental health, and family supports. If we keep politics out of the exam room and put resources into helping people carry pregnancies safely when they choose, we can reduce harm, lower abortions over time, and treat everyone with dignity.",
    "308": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and respect for privacy\u2014keeping politicians out of exam rooms and letting patients and qualified clinicians make time-sensitive decisions, especially when health, safety, or severe fetal complications are involved. I also take seriously that many people view potential life as morally significant, which is why I can support clear, medically grounded standards that avoid criminalizing people in crisis and still allow room for conscience. The most durable common ground, to me, is doing far more to prevent unwanted pregnancies and desperation in the first place through honest education, affordable contraception, and real support for parenting\u2014healthcare, childcare, and paid leave\u2014so fewer families ever face this choice.",
    "568": "Abortion laws should be guided by a serious respect for human life, but also by the reality that pregnancies can involve violence, medical danger, and situations where families are already hanging by a thread, so the rules need to be clear, workable, and leave room for timely medical judgment. I can support firm limits that reflect the moral weight of a developing child if they come with plainly written exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and severe medical complications, and are paired with real prevention and support\u2014education, contraception, prenatal care, and adoption resources\u2014so fewer people ever reach that crisis point. The goal shouldn\u2019t be punishment or politics; it should be fewer abortions, safer outcomes, and a system that treats everyone involved with dignity.",
    "686": "Abortion is a morally serious matter, and the law should show real respect for unborn life while also making clear, workable room for medical emergencies, rape, and incest so doctors can act and families aren\u2019t trapped in fear. I want fewer abortions, and the surest way to get there is prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal care, and practical help for parenting or adoption\u2014so choosing life is possible, not just demanded. If we keep politics out of the exam room but insist on humane limits and real resources, we can protect dignity on all sides and lower the number of desperate choices.",
    "622": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for personal privacy, because real situations can get complicated fast and politicians aren\u2019t the ones living with the consequences. I can also respect that many people see real moral value in developing life, which is why I\u2019m open to clear, medically grounded lines later in pregnancy as long as there are rock-solid exceptions for health risks, nonviable pregnancies, and cases like rape or incest, and no one in crisis is criminalized. The best common ground is making fewer people face this decision at all by investing in comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and real support for parents and adoption.",
    "320": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for privacy\u2014keeping time-sensitive decisions primarily between the person who is pregnant and qualified clinicians, not politicians or prosecutors. I also take seriously the moral weight many attach to potential life, which is why I favor clear, workable rules that protect health and include straightforward exceptions for serious medical risk, rape, incest, and nonviable pregnancies. The most durable common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and real support for parents\u2014prenatal care, mental health services, childcare, and paid leave\u2014so fewer families ever feel cornered.",
    "289": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and the idea that politicians shouldn\u2019t be in the exam room, especially when someone\u2019s health, safety, or family situation is on the line. I also respect that many people see real moral value in unborn life, so I can support clear, workable rules that protect patients and doctors, include firm exceptions for medical emergencies, and avoid turning desperate families into criminals. The best common ground is prevention and support: better education, affordable contraception, and real help with prenatal care, childcare, and wages so fewer people ever feel cornered into this decision.",
    "256": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical evidence, and respect for privacy, so families can make time-sensitive decisions with qualified clinicians without fear of punishment. I also hear the sincere moral concern for potential life, and I think the best way to lower abortions is to prevent crisis pregnancies in the first place with honest education, affordable contraception, and real support for parents\u2014prenatal care, childcare, and paid leave. If the law draws lines, they should be clear and medically grounded, with firm protections for health and safety and no room for political games in the exam room.",
    "438": "Abortion law should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a respect for privacy\u2014keeping politicians out of the exam room while recognizing the real moral weight many people feel about developing life. To me, the humane middle is protecting timely access early in pregnancy, with clear, workable exceptions for health emergencies and the hardest circumstances, written so clinicians can act without fear. And if we\u2019re serious about fewer abortions, we should invest where agreement is easiest: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and the economic supports that make parenting or adoption a real option. As one writer put it, \u201cThe truth is rarely pure and never simple,\u201d and our laws should meet people in complexity with dignity rather than punishment.",
    "21": "I want abortion laws guided by compassion, medical evidence, and basic privacy\u2014keeping politicians out of exam rooms so people can make time-sensitive decisions with their doctors, especially when health, safety, or severe fetal complications are involved. At the same time, I take seriously that many people see real moral value in potential life, so I\u2019d rather put most of our energy into what actually reduces abortions: honest sex education, affordable contraception, and real support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption. If the law draws lines, they should be clear, medically workable, and never written to punish people in crisis. We won\u2019t all agree on where life begins, but we can agree that fewer unintended pregnancies, safer healthcare, and stronger families are goals worth building policy around.",
    "591": "Laws on abortion should begin with a real respect for human life, but they also have to be written with mercy and enough clarity that doctors can act quickly when a mother\u2019s life or health is truly in danger, or when tragedy is involved. I want fewer abortions, and the most honest way to get there is to prevent crisis pregnancies and make it easier to choose birth through practical support\u2014prenatal care, counseling, adoption help, and community resources that don\u2019t disappear after delivery. Even with deep moral disagreement, we can agree that no woman should be treated like a criminal in a moment of fear, and no child should be welcomed into the world without a serious commitment to help families thrive.",
    "667": "I\u2019ve come to believe abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical reality, and the privacy people need to make time-sensitive decisions with their doctors, especially when health, safety, or nonviable pregnancies are involved. At the same time, I respect that many see real moral weight in potential life, which is why I want policy to focus less on punishment and more on preventing crisis\u2014through comprehensive education, affordable contraception, and strong supports like prenatal care, counseling, childcare, and paid leave. If we keep politicians out of exam rooms while building a safety net that makes welcoming a child truly possible, we can lower abortions and treat families with dignity even when we disagree.",
    "524": "I\u2019ve spent my life believing you measure a community by whether it shows up when things get hard, and abortion is one of those issues where real life doesn\u2019t fit neat slogans. Laws should respect the value of unborn life while also keeping clear, workable exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to the mother\u2019s health so doctors can act fast and families aren\u2019t left in a panic. If we want fewer abortions and less heartbreak, we ought to put as much effort into prevention and support\u2014contraception, honest education, prenatal care, adoption help, and real assistance for parents\u2014as we do into arguing about the lines.",
    "103": "Abortion law should be guided by a sober respect for human life and a clear-eyed compassion for the hard cases where pregnancy becomes dangerous, traumatic, or medically untenable, so clinicians can act without fear and families aren\u2019t left in limbo. I can\u2019t accept a framework that treats abortion as casual, but I also don\u2019t trust broad, punitive rules that ignore the messy realities of medicine and conscience. The most durable common ground is fewer crisis pregnancies in the first place\u2014through honest education, accessible contraception, and real support for mothers, fathers, adoption, and child-rearing\u2014paired with clear limits and carefully defined exceptions that are written plainly and applied humanely.",
    "664": "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a respect for personal conscience\u2014keeping politicians out of the exam room while making sure care is safe, timely, and clearly protected when health is at risk. I can respect the moral concern many feel about developing life, but I don\u2019t think criminal bans handle the messy reality families and doctors face in a crisis. The common ground is to prevent fewer people from reaching that point at all by funding comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and the practical supports\u2014healthcare, childcare, and paid leave\u2014that make carrying a pregnancy and raising a child a real option.",
    "484": "To me, abortion laws should keep people safe and let time-sensitive decisions stay between the pregnant person and their doctor, not politicians, while still respecting that a lot of folks see real moral weight in potential life. I can live with clear, medically grounded guardrails later in pregnancy and straightforward exceptions for health emergencies, rape, incest, and nonviable pregnancies, as long as nobody gets criminalized for being in a crisis. The real common ground is prevention and support\u2014better sex ed, easy access to contraception, and real help with prenatal care, childcare, and paid leave\u2014so fewer people feel trapped in the first place. If we lead with compassion and practical resources instead of shame, we can lower harm and lower abortions without taking away dignity.",
    "151": "I believe laws on abortion should start with a real respect for unborn life, but also be written with enough compassion and clarity that doctors can act quickly when a mother\u2019s life or health is in serious danger, and that families facing rape, incest, or devastating complications aren\u2019t treated like criminals. At the same time, the most practical common ground is to prevent crisis pregnancies in the first place through honest education, accessible contraception, and strong support for parents\u2014healthcare, counseling, adoption services, and help that makes choosing life possible. If we keep the tone humble and the focus on dignity, responsibility, and real help, we can lower abortions and reduce suffering without turning private pain into political warfare.",
    "251": "Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a basic respect for privacy\u2014because one-size-fits-all rules don\u2019t hold up when real families face health risks, trauma, or heartbreaking diagnoses. I can also respect the moral seriousness many attach to developing life, which is why any limits should be clear, clinically grounded, and paired with strong exceptions for health and safety, not enforced through punishment or political theater.

If we focus less on punishment and more on prevention and real options, we can lower abortions and treat one another like neighbors, not enemies.",
    "481": "Laws on abortion should start from respect for human life and the reality that pregnancies can turn into medical emergencies or heartbreaking situations where families need timely care, not fear and confusion. I can support clear, workable limits that reflect the growing moral weight of unborn life, as long as there are unambiguous exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health threats, and the rules are written so doctors can act without waiting on lawyers. The most practical common ground is preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place\u2014better education, easy access to contraception, and real support for parents, adoption, and childcare\u2014so choosing life is possible, not just preached. If policy is aimed at fewer abortions and less suffering, it has to pair moral seriousness with compassion, honesty, and tangible help.",

In practical terms, I support strong protection for early access and explicit exceptions for health risks, rape or incest, and severe fetal diagnoses, because rules that ignore edge cases tend to fail in the real world. If we treat this like a problem of minimizing harm\u2014reducing unwanted pregnancies, improving support for families, and keeping people safe\u2014we can lower the temperature without denying anyone\u2019s dignity.",

The best way to lower abortions without tearing communities apart is to put more effort into prevention and real alternatives: responsible education, easy access to contraception, strong prenatal care, and adoption and parenting support that doesn\u2019t leave people stranded.
