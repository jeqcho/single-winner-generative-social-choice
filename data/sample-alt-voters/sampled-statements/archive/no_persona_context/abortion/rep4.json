    "Laws on abortion should start from compassion and medical reality: protect a pregnant person\u2019s health and privacy, and ensure doctors can act quickly in emergencies without fear of punishment. At the same time, policy can acknowledge the moral value many attach to developing life by emphasizing prevention\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception\u2014and robust support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption so fewer people face crisis decisions.",
    "Abortion law should be written to reduce harm in the real world\u2014clear rules, clear medical exceptions, and decisions guided by patients and qualified clinicians rather than politics. Common ground is pairing whatever limits exist with strong commitments to preventing unintended pregnancies and to supporting families with prenatal care, mental health services, childcare, and economic stability.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should respect both the dignity of the pregnant person and the sincere concern many have for unborn life, avoiding one-size-fits-all mandates that ignore complex circumstances. A practical compromise is to protect timely access when health, safety, or nonviability is at issue, while investing heavily in contraception, education, and family supports that make choosing to carry a pregnancy realistic.",
    "Abortion policy should aim for fewer tragedies: keep people safe with evidence-based healthcare and protect space for personal conscience in hard cases. The most durable approach combines privacy and medical discretion with prevention and support\u2014so coercion, poverty, or lack of care doesn\u2019t decide for anyone.",
    "Laws on abortion should be humane, predictable, and centered on health, recognizing that families face complicated, time-sensitive situations that no statute can fully anticipate. Even amid moral disagreement, common ground is expanding real options\u2014contraception access, honest education, prenatal and postpartum care, and adoption resources\u2014so fewer people feel cornered into an irreversible decision.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by human dignity on all sides: protecting a pregnant person\u2019s health and autonomy while taking seriously the moral concern many feel for developing life. A workable approach pairs clear, medically grounded rules and exceptions for life-threatening situations, rape or incest, and nonviable pregnancies with strong prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and resources for parenting and adoption\u2014so fewer people face crisis decisions.",
    "Abortion law should aim to reduce suffering and reduce the need for abortion, without turning private medical crises into criminal cases. That means keeping timely decisions with patients and clinicians, setting any limits in evidence and enforceable clarity, and guaranteeing exceptions when health, viability, or violence are involved. The strongest common ground is investing in prevention and family supports so choosing to carry a pregnancy is genuinely possible.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by practical compassion: protect life where we reasonably can, and protect the pregnant person\u2019s safety, privacy, and medical judgment where we must. Common ground looks like early access with informed consent, carefully defined later guardrails that don\u2019t block emergency care, and a shared commitment to fewer unintended pregnancies through education, contraception, and real economic and healthcare support for families.",
    "Abortion policy should recognize moral disagreement while still committing to outcomes most people want: fewer unintended pregnancies, fewer dangerous delays in care, and more stable families. A balanced law keeps politicians out of the exam room, includes clear health and severe fetal-condition exceptions, and pairs any legal framework with robust contraception access, prenatal and postpartum care, and support for parenting and adoption.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by responsibility and compassion rather than punishment\u2014treating pregnancy as a complex medical and family reality, not a slogan. The best bridge is clear, medically workable standards that protect a person\u2019s life and health and respect conscience, alongside serious investment in prevention, childcare, healthcare, and adoption supports so no one feels forced by circumstance.",
    "Laws on abortion should protect human dignity by keeping patients safe and allowing timely medical care, especially in emergencies, while also recognizing the moral seriousness many attach to developing life. A durable framework pairs clear, workable standards and health exceptions with strong prevention and support\u2014education, contraception access, prenatal care, and help for parenting or adoption\u2014so fewer people are pushed into crisis decisions.",
    "Abortion law should aim for the least harm in the real world: protect a person\u2019s health and privacy, respect conscience, and avoid vague rules that trap doctors and families in fear. Common ground is combining medically clear guardrails and compassionate exceptions with serious investment in reducing unintended pregnancies and making it realistic to carry a pregnancy to term.",
    "Laws should acknowledge both the value many place on unborn life and the reality that pregnancy can involve urgent medical risk, trauma, and hardship that outsiders can\u2019t fully judge. The most humane approach is to keep decisions close to patients and clinicians, set transparent standards for later-term situations, and back it all with prevention and family supports that reduce the need for abortion.",
    "Abortion policy should be written with compassion and medical clarity, so care is safe, timely, and not treated as a criminal matter, while still taking seriously the moral concern for potential life. A balanced law focuses on prevention and real options\u2014education, contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and economic support\u2014so people are less likely to face desperate choices.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should prioritize patient safety and informed consent, protect access in cases of serious health risk, and set any limits in ways doctors can actually apply. At the same time, they should reflect a shared goal of fewer abortions by expanding contraception, accurate education, and practical support for families who choose to continue pregnancies.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, dignity, and ability to make time-sensitive medical decisions with qualified clinicians. A workable compromise pairs clear, medically grounded rules and exceptions for serious health risks, rape, or nonviable pregnancies with strong prevention and support\u2014education, contraception, prenatal care, and resources for parenting and adoption\u2014so fewer people face a crisis in the first place.",
    "Abortion law should be written to reduce harm in the real world: protect patient safety and privacy, avoid criminalizing families and clinicians, and recognize that tragic cases don\u2019t fit one-size-fits-all mandates. Common ground comes from combining practical limits and clear medical exceptions with major investments in contraception, accurate sex education, prenatal/postpartum care, and economic supports that make carrying a pregnancy realistic.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should take seriously both the moral value many place on developing life and the reality that pregnancy can involve medical danger, trauma, and profound hardship. The most durable approach keeps urgent decisions in the hands of patients and doctors, sets transparent standards that the public can understand, and backs them with prevention and family supports so choosing parenthood or adoption is truly possible.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by compassion and accountability: protect health and informed consent, prevent coercion, and ensure exceptions when a life or serious health is at stake. At the same time, it should aim for fewer unintended pregnancies and fewer desperate choices by expanding contraception access, comprehensive education, and concrete support for parents and children.",
    "Laws on abortion should prioritize human dignity on all sides by combining evidence-based medical safeguards with room for individual conscience in complicated, time-sensitive situations. If the shared goal is fewer abortions and fewer tragedies, the law should emphasize prevention and support\u2014healthcare, contraception, counseling, and resources for parenting or adoption\u2014rather than punishment.",
    "Laws on abortion should start from a shared commitment to human dignity: protecting patients\u2019 health and safety, acknowledging the moral seriousness many attach to developing life, and keeping room for medical judgment in time-sensitive situations. Common ground is pairing clear, workable standards and exceptions with strong prevention and support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and real help for families\u2014so fewer people face crisis decisions in the first place.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by compassion and practical reality: decisions are personal and medically complex, and the law should be clear enough that care isn\u2019t delayed when health is at risk. A durable approach combines privacy and informed consent with targeted guardrails and exceptions, while investing in contraception, sex education, and economic and healthcare supports that make parenting or adoption genuinely feasible.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to reduce harm and coercion in every direction, recognizing both the autonomy of the pregnant person and the sincere desire many have to protect potential life. That means keeping politicians out of the exam room where emergencies arise, setting predictable rules that clinicians can follow, and building a stronger safety net\u2014prevention, prenatal care, and family supports\u2014so fewer pregnancies become desperate crossroads.",
    "A common-ground abortion law treats pregnancy as morally weighty while still recognizing that one-size-fits-all bans can endanger health and punish people in crisis. The focus should be on early, informed decision-making, clear medical exceptions, and broad investments in contraception, maternal care, childcare, and adoption support so the number of unwanted pregnancies\u2014and the need for abortion\u2014falls over time.",
    "Abortion laws should be guided by a balanced ethic of responsibility and compassion: protect life where possible, but prioritize safety, privacy, and timely medical care when circumstances are dangerous or heartbreaking. The strongest agreement point is prevention and support\u2014education, contraception access, and resources for parents\u2014so fewer families are forced to choose between bad options.",
    "Laws on abortion should recognize both the moral concern many feel for developing life and the urgent reality that pregnancy can involve medical risk, trauma, and family hardship. A workable framework protects timely, evidence-based care with clear exceptions for threats to life and serious health, while pairing any limits with real investments that prevent crisis pregnancies\u2014comprehensive education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, childcare, and adoption supports.",
    "Abortion law should aim to reduce suffering and avoid one-size-fits-all rules by keeping medical decisions anchored in patient safety and professional judgment. At the same time, it can take moral concerns seriously by emphasizing prevention and support\u2014better contraception access, accurate information, and practical resources that make carrying a pregnancy to term a realistic option. Clear, humane standards and well-defined medical exceptions can lower conflict while protecting both dignity and health.",
    "Laws should protect personal autonomy and privacy in early pregnancy while acknowledging that many citizens believe the state has an interest in potential life as pregnancy advances. Common ground is pairing any gestational guardrails with unambiguous health exceptions and with policies that measurably reduce unwanted pregnancies\u2014sex education, contraception, and accessible healthcare. The goal should be fewer crises, safer care, and more real choices rather than punishment.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by compassion and medical reality, ensuring no one is denied time-sensitive care when health or safety is at stake. It should also reflect a shared desire to see fewer abortions by investing in prevention and in supports for parenting and adoption, so decisions aren\u2019t driven by poverty, fear, or lack of care. Writing clear rules that clinicians can follow helps protect both patients and moral pluralism.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should start from respect for human dignity on all sides: the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy and the value many place on unborn life. A durable compromise keeps politicians out of the exam room in emergencies, sets clear and medically grounded standards, and expands the practical supports that reduce unwanted pregnancies and strengthen families. Prevention, clarity, and compassion are more effective than criminalization.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by human dignity on all sides: protecting a pregnant person\u2019s health and freedom to make time-sensitive medical decisions, while acknowledging the moral seriousness many attach to developing life. A workable framework keeps politicians out of the exam room, sets clear and medically grounded standards with explicit exceptions for life and serious health threats, and invests heavily in prevention and support\u2014sex education, contraception, prenatal care, and resources for parents and adoption.",
    "Abortion law should aim to reduce harm and crisis rather than score ideological victories, recognizing both bodily autonomy and sincere concern for unborn life. Common ground can look like strong early access and privacy, carefully defined later guardrails that rely on medical evidence, and no-fault exceptions for rape, incest, and serious health or nonviability cases. Pairing any limits with real supports\u2014contraception, childcare, prenatal and mental health care\u2014helps ensure no one is coerced by poverty or lack of options.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion, clarity, and medical reality, so families and clinicians can act quickly when health or safety is at stake. They should also reflect society\u2019s responsibility to make unplanned pregnancy rarer and parenting more feasible through education, contraception access, and robust prenatal and postnatal support. That combination respects moral disagreement while focusing policy on fewer tragedies and better outcomes.",
    "Abortion policy should start from the shared goals of fewer unwanted pregnancies, fewer desperate situations, and safer care for those who face complicated pregnancies. The law can respect moral concerns about potential life by encouraging early, informed decision-making and setting transparent standards, while still protecting privacy and guaranteeing exceptions when a person\u2019s life or serious health is at risk. Real investment in healthcare, contraception, and family supports is the bridge that makes any legal framework humane.",
    "Laws on abortion should protect life and liberty by treating pregnancy as both morally weighty and medically complex. That means safeguarding a person\u2019s right to timely, evidence-based care with clear emergency and severe-complication exceptions, while pursuing prevention and practical support so continuing a pregnancy is a real option. The best compromise is less punishment, more clarity for doctors, and more resources for families.",
    "Laws on abortion should protect health and human dignity by keeping urgent medical decisions workable for patients and clinicians, while recognizing that many people see unborn life as morally significant. A durable compromise pairs clear, medically grounded rules and exceptions with strong prevention and support\u2014contraception, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, and help for parenting or adoption\u2014so fewer people face crisis pregnancies. The aim should be less suffering, fewer unintended pregnancies, and policies that neither punish families in crisis nor ignore conscience.",
    "Abortion law should be guided by compassion and practical medical reality, acknowledging both a pregnant person\u2019s autonomy and the widespread desire to protect developing life. The best common ground is clear, evidence-based standards that safeguard timely care in emergencies and hard cases, alongside serious investment in prevention, maternal healthcare, and family supports. If policy expands real options and reduces coercion\u2014whether toward abortion or childbirth\u2014it can lower abortions without turning private tragedy into criminal punishment.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should start from two shared concerns: protecting life and preventing needless harm to people facing complex pregnancies. That means keeping decisions close to patients and qualified clinicians, with clear exceptions when health, safety, or nonviability is at stake, while also strengthening contraception access, sex education, prenatal care, and economic supports that make carrying a pregnancy realistic. A humane framework measures success by fewer crisis pregnancies and better outcomes for parents and children.",
    "Abortion policy should reflect moral seriousness about potential life and equal seriousness about the health, privacy, and lived realities of those who are pregnant. Common ground is achievable when laws are clear enough for doctors to act, include meaningful health-based exceptions, and are paired with robust prevention and support\u2014contraception, education, childcare, and adoption resources. The goal is to reduce unintended pregnancies and suffering without forcing one set of beliefs through punitive rules.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by dignity, safety, and responsibility\u2014protecting patients from dangerous delays while respecting that many citizens view pregnancy as the start of a human life deserving protection. A balanced approach emphasizes early, informed decision-making, narrowly tailored limits with medically clear exceptions, and major commitments to contraception, prenatal care, mental health services, and family support. When prevention and support are central, the debate can shift from punishment to reducing harm and strengthening families.",
    "Laws on abortion should protect health, dignity, and freedom of conscience while acknowledging that many people also feel a duty to protect developing life. A workable approach keeps urgent medical decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians, sets clear and humane standards with narrowly defined exceptions, and avoids criminalizing people in crisis. Common ground is investing heavily in prevention and support\u2014contraception access, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, and economic help\u2014so fewer families face this decision at all.",
    "Abortion law should be grounded in compassion and medical evidence, with rules clear enough that doctors can act quickly when health or safety is at stake. It should respect personal autonomy while also reflecting the widely held belief that potential life deserves moral seriousness, using carefully limited guardrails rather than sweeping bans or unrestricted mandates. The most durable compromise pairs any legal framework with robust prevention and family support so people have real options, not forced choices.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to reduce harm: protect the pregnant person\u2019s life and health, respect privacy, and recognize the moral weight many attach to unborn life. That means keeping complex cases with patients and qualified clinicians, setting predictable standards, and ensuring compassionate exceptions for medical emergencies and severe circumstances. At the same time, shared investment in contraception, sex education, and supports for parenting and adoption can lower unintended pregnancies and ease the pressures that drive crisis decisions.",
    "Abortion policy should treat pregnancy as both a profound moral question and a time-sensitive medical reality, so the law must be humane, practical, and not driven by punishment. Protecting early, safe access alongside clear later safeguards and well-defined health exceptions can acknowledge different convictions without forcing one belief on everyone. Broad agreement is most achievable when prevention and support\u2014healthcare, counseling, contraception, and resources for parents\u2014are central rather than afterthoughts.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for bodily autonomy with a commitment to value and protect human life, especially by prioritizing safety and clarity in medical care. Decisions should be made as close as possible to the patient and doctor, with transparent limits that include meaningful exceptions when health, viability, or trauma is involved. Whatever the boundaries, society should work to prevent unwanted pregnancies and strengthen family supports so fewer people are pushed into desperate choices.",
    "Abortion law should be built around protecting human dignity on all sides: safeguarding a pregnant person\u2019s health, privacy, and ability to get timely medical care, while acknowledging the moral seriousness many attach to developing life. A workable framework combines clear, medically grounded rules and exceptions for threats to life or health (and other extreme circumstances) with major investments that reduce crisis pregnancies\u2014contraception access, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real support for parents and adoption.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to reduce suffering and prevent coercion, recognizing that pregnancy can involve urgent medical realities as well as profound moral convictions. Common ground is found by keeping clinicians free to act in emergencies, setting transparent standards people can understand, and pairing any limits with strong prevention and family supports\u2014contraception, sex education, healthcare, and economic help\u2014so fewer people face this decision in the first place.",
    "Abortion policy should neither treat pregnancy as a crime nor ignore the ethical weight many people place on unborn life; it should focus on safety, clarity, and compassion. That means protecting access to timely medical care with well-defined health exceptions, while also committing to practical measures that make choosing parenthood feasible and reduce unintended pregnancies through education, contraception, and robust prenatal and childcare support.",
    "Good abortion laws should reflect two realities at once: many view fetal life as worthy of protection, and pregnancy decisions can be medically complex and deeply personal. A balanced approach keeps the exam room centered on patient and doctor\u2014especially when health or viability is at stake\u2014while advancing shared goals like fewer unintended pregnancies, more support for mothers and families, and rules written clearly enough that no one is left guessing in a crisis.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by humility about one-size-fits-all mandates and by a commitment to measurable public health outcomes, without dismissing sincere moral objections. The best bridge is a system that ensures safe, timely care with explicit medical protections, and that prioritizes prevention and support\u2014contraception access, comprehensive education, mental healthcare, and resources for parenting or adoption\u2014so choices are real rather than forced by hardship.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by human dignity on all sides: protecting patients\u2019 health and privacy while acknowledging the moral seriousness many attach to developing life. A workable framework keeps urgent medical decisions with patients and clinicians, sets clear and humane standards that doctors can follow, and includes well-defined exceptions for threats to life or serious harm. Common ground grows when policy also invests in what prevents crisis\u2014accurate sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical support for parenting and adoption.",
    "Abortion laws should prioritize compassion and medical reality, recognizing that pregnancies can involve time-sensitive risks and heartbreaking diagnoses that can\u2019t be reduced to slogans. At the same time, the law can reflect widely shared concern for potential life by encouraging earlier decision-making where possible and by pairing any limits with clear health exceptions and non-punitive enforcement. The strongest overlap is preventing unwanted pregnancies and supporting families\u2014through contraception access, education, healthcare, and economic help\u2014so fewer people face an impossible choice.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by a commitment to reduce suffering: protect safe, timely care when health is at stake, and avoid turning private crises into criminal cases. They should also take seriously the belief that unborn life has value by setting transparent, evidence-based guardrails and funding real alternatives like prenatal care, childcare support, and adoption services. Common ground is building conditions where decisions are informed, voluntary, and less driven by fear, poverty, or lack of medical access.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by respect for conscience and by practical outcomes\u2014keeping politicians out of the exam room while ensuring clear rules that protect patient safety and allow clinicians to act in emergencies. A durable approach recognizes moral disagreement about when life begins, yet agrees that coercion and stigma help no one and that exceptions for serious medical risk must be workable. Investing in prevention and family support can reduce abortions while honoring both autonomy and concern for life.",
    "Laws regarding abortion should aim for a humane balance: affirm the worth of potential life without denying the pregnant person\u2019s right to make a private, medically informed decision in complex circumstances. Clear standards, careful exceptions for health and nonviable pregnancies, and protections for clinicians acting in good faith can lower conflict and confusion. Broad agreement is most reachable when policy focuses on prevention\u2014education, contraception, and strong prenatal and economic supports\u2014rather than punishment.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a commitment to protect health and human dignity in real, time-sensitive medical situations, while taking seriously the moral concern many feel about developing life. A workable common ground is keeping urgent clinical decisions in the hands of patients and qualified doctors, pairing any limits with clear exceptions for life, serious health risk, rape/incest, and nonviable pregnancies. The most durable policy also invests in prevention and support\u2014education, contraception, prenatal care, adoption pathways, and help for families\u2014so fewer people face crisis choices in the first place.",
    "Abortion law should be guided less by punishment and more by compassion, clarity, and measurable public health outcomes for women, children, and families. That means protecting private, timely medical care\u2014especially in emergencies\u2014while allowing democratically set guardrails that are written clearly and include humane exceptions. Common ground grows when society also reduces unwanted pregnancies and makes parenting or adoption realistic through contraception access, accurate education, healthcare, and economic support.",
    "Laws on abortion should start with the shared aims of reducing suffering, preventing coercion, and helping children be born into stable, supported circumstances. People can disagree about when legal protection for fetal life should begin while still agreeing that doctors need clear rules for medical crises and that families need real options besides desperation. Pairing any legal framework with strong prevention and family supports\u2014contraception, sex education, prenatal care, mental health care, and adoption resources\u2014offers a path that respects both conscience and safety.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by respect for life and for bodily autonomy, recognizing that both values point toward limiting harm rather than escalating conflict. A bridging approach protects early access and medical privacy, draws carefully defined boundaries later in pregnancy, and guarantees explicit exceptions when health, viability, or violence are at issue. It also treats prevention and support as central\u2014making contraception, healthcare, and family resources widely available\u2014so fewer people are forced into agonizing decisions.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by the principle that no family should be forced into a life-altering decision by fear, poverty, or delayed medical care, while also acknowledging the ethical weight many place on unborn life. Clear, humane rules can combine patient-and-doctor decision-making with limits that include unambiguous health and safety exceptions. The strongest common ground is reducing the need for abortion through contraception, accurate education, prenatal care, and concrete support for parenting and adoption.",
    "Laws on abortion should treat pregnancy as both a serious moral question and a real-world medical reality, so they must protect patient safety, privacy, and timely clinical judgment while acknowledging a shared desire to reduce suffering. A workable framework pairs clear, medically grounded rules and narrowly tailored exceptions for health, rape/incest, and severe fetal conditions with major investments in prevention\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong prenatal, postpartum, and parenting supports\u2014so fewer people face crisis decisions.",
    "Abortion law should be guided less by punishment and more by human dignity: protecting a person\u2019s ability to make time-sensitive medical decisions with qualified clinicians while recognizing that many citizens view developing life as morally significant. Common ground is setting clear, evidence-based guardrails and exceptions for emergencies and nonviability, alongside robust policies that prevent unintended pregnancies and make choosing parenthood or adoption genuinely supported.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for bodily autonomy with a sober respect for potential life by focusing on what reliably reduces harm: safe, timely care; clear standards doctors can follow; and protections against coercion. The most durable compromise couples early access and medically necessary exceptions with strong prevention and family supports\u2014contraception, sex education, prenatal care, childcare, and economic stability\u2014so fewer pregnancies end in crisis.",
    "Abortion policy should start from compassion for families in difficult circumstances and humility about one-size-fits-all rules, keeping medical decisions close to patients and clinicians while ensuring transparent, workable limits. At the same time, it should pursue shared goals\u2014fewer unintended pregnancies, fewer late emergencies, and healthier families\u2014through contraception access, honest education, prenatal and mental health care, and practical support for raising a child or pursuing adoption.",
    "Laws on abortion should recognize that people disagree deeply about when life begins, but can still agree that no one should be forced into danger, secrecy, or desperation. A bridging approach protects health and privacy with clear exceptions and clinically grounded standards, while committing public resources to prevention and support\u2014education, contraception, maternal healthcare, and family assistance\u2014so both responsibility and compassion are built into the law.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for developing life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, dignity, and ability to make time-sensitive medical decisions with qualified clinicians. A durable framework would pair any limits with clear, workable exceptions for serious health threats, rape or incest, and cases of nonviability, so doctors aren\u2019t forced to wait until crisis. Common ground also means investing in prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and resources for parenting and adoption\u2014so fewer families face this decision in the first place.",
    "Abortion laws should be guided less by punishment and more by compassion, medical evidence, and predictable rules that protect both patients and clinicians in emergencies. People can disagree about when life begins and still agree on shared goals: fewer unintended pregnancies, fewer tragedies, and more support for those who continue a pregnancy. That means pairing clear health-and-safety standards with strong access to contraception, prenatal care, mental health care, and practical help for parents and adoption.",
    "Laws on abortion should recognize the moral seriousness many attach to potential life while keeping deeply personal medical decisions close to the patient and their doctor, not politics. Any restrictions should be written plainly with real-world exceptions for threats to life or health and other extreme circumstances, so care isn\u2019t delayed by fear or confusion. At the same time, society should put far more effort into prevention and support\u2014education, contraception, and economic and healthcare resources\u2014so choosing to carry a pregnancy is genuinely feasible.",
    "A workable abortion policy starts with a commitment to human dignity on all sides: protecting health and safety, respecting conscience, and taking concerns about unborn life seriously without criminalizing people in crisis. Common ground is a clear legal baseline that allows early access and preserves medical judgment in complicated cases, alongside fair guardrails and transparent standards. The strongest agreement comes from reducing the need for abortion through contraception access, accurate education, and robust support for pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting.",
    "Abortion laws should aim to reduce harm by combining medical reality with moral humility\u2014accepting that families face situations no statute can fully predict. That points to policies that keep care safe and timely, include explicit exceptions for serious health risks and severe fetal conditions, and avoid turning private tragedy into criminal prosecution. It also points to shared investment in prevention and family supports so fewer pregnancies become crises and more children are born into stable, supported homes.",
    "Abortion laws should start from a shared commitment to reduce suffering and protect health, while treating pregnancy as morally serious and deeply personal. A workable framework keeps urgent medical decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians, includes clear exceptions for threats to life and severe complications, and relies on prevention\u2014education, contraception access, and economic supports\u2014so fewer people face crisis pregnancies. The goal is fewer tragedies and fewer abortions, achieved through clarity, compassion, and practical support rather than punishment.",
    "Abortion policy should balance respect for bodily autonomy with a real concern for developing life by focusing on what helps families in practice, not just in principle. That means protecting timely medical care and clear health-related exceptions, while pairing any limits with strong investments in contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, adoption supports, and childcare so people have genuine options. Laws should be written plainly enough for doctors to act without fear and for communities to lower conflict by lowering crisis.",
    "Good abortion laws should recognize two truths at once: many people see fetal life as deserving protection, and many pregnancies involve circumstances that only the patient and their doctors can responsibly navigate. Common ground is a system that avoids criminalizing people in crisis, guarantees emergency and health protections, and concentrates public effort on prevention and support so fewer pregnancies are unintended and more families can choose stability. Compassionate guardrails and real resources can reduce both harm and polarization.",
    "Abortion laws should be guided less by ideology and more by clear medical standards, privacy, and a shared desire to prevent hardship for parents and children. A balanced approach protects early access and ensures later decisions involving serious health risks or nonviable pregnancies are made with clinicians, while also expanding contraception, sex education, and family supports to reduce the need for abortion. The measure of success is fewer crisis pregnancies, safer care, and stronger support for anyone who carries to term.",
    "Abortion policy should aim to protect dignity on all sides by combining personal freedom with meaningful responsibility and support. That looks like keeping the government out of the exam room in emergencies, allowing carefully defined health and trauma-related exceptions, and investing heavily in prevention and family stability so choosing parenthood is realistically supported. When laws are humane, clear, and paired with resources, communities can pursue fewer abortions without forcing unsafe outcomes.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a commitment to human dignity and practical compassion: protecting a pregnant person\u2019s health and ability to get timely medical care, while treating developing life as morally significant to many. A workable framework focuses on clear, medically grounded rules with narrow, unambiguous exceptions for serious health risks and devastating circumstances, and it avoids criminalizing patients or clinicians acting in good faith. Whatever limits exist, reducing unintended pregnancies through accurate education, affordable contraception, and strong support for parents and adoption should be a shared priority.",
    "Abortion laws should be guided by real-world safety and moral seriousness\u2014recognizing both the autonomy of the person who is pregnant and the concern many feel for unborn life. Common ground is keeping urgent medical decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians, with clear standards and exceptions that prevent delays in emergencies. The most durable policy also invests in prevention and support\u2014contraception access, prenatal and mental healthcare, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014so fewer people face a crisis at all.",
    "Laws on abortion should aim to reduce suffering and protect health without pretending that one rigid rule fits every pregnancy. That means safeguarding private, timely care\u2014especially in cases of medical risk\u2014while allowing room for communities to express the value they place on potential life through reasonable, clearly written limits and support for carrying to term. Prevention and practical help should be the center of policy: comprehensive education, affordable contraception, and strong resources for parents so decisions aren\u2019t driven by fear or poverty.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by compassion, evidence-based medicine, and respect for conscience, acknowledging that people disagree sincerely about when life deserves legal protection. A shared path is clear, workable law that prioritizes patient safety and allows clinicians to act quickly when health or viability is at stake, without turning tragedy into prosecution. At the same time, society should do more upstream\u2014expand contraception, sex education, prenatal care, and family supports\u2014so fewer pregnancies become emergencies or unwanted.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by the twin goals of protecting life and protecting people from preventable harm, with medical expertise\u2014not political theater\u2014setting the safety standards. Common ground looks like early, accessible care and later rules that are precise, humane, and include clear exceptions for threats to health, rape or incest, and severe fetal conditions. Alongside any legal framework, serious investment in prevention and family support can reduce abortions while respecting the complexity families actually live with.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should start from protecting human dignity on all sides: the health and autonomy of the pregnant person and the moral seriousness many attach to developing life. A workable approach pairs clear, medically grounded rules and exceptions for life and serious health risks with strong prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and help for parenting or adoption\u2014so fewer people face crisis decisions. The goal is fewer tragedies and more real choices, without turning private medical care into punishment or politics.",
    "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion and medical reality, keeping urgent decisions in the hands of patients and qualified clinicians rather than forcing one-size-fits-all mandates. At the same time, policy can acknowledge the value many people place on unborn life by emphasizing prevention and practical support\u2014contraception, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, and resources that make carrying a pregnancy feasible. Common ground comes from reducing harm, preventing coercion, and writing clear rules that protect health and treat families with dignity.",
    "What should guide abortion law is a commitment to reduce suffering and increase stability for families, using evidence-based health standards instead of shame or slogans. That means protecting timely care and clear exceptions when health or viability is at stake, while also investing heavily in the measures that reduce unwanted pregnancies and support births\u2014education, contraception access, healthcare, childcare, and adoption services. A fair framework protects conscience by limiting government intrusion while ensuring no one is forced into danger by delay, cost, or confusion.",
    "Abortion policy should treat pregnancy as morally significant while recognizing that real-life circumstances and medical risks vary too widely for rigid political rules. The most constructive laws protect early, private decision-making, allow well-defined exceptions for serious health threats and extreme cases, and pair any limits with real supports that help people choose parenthood if they want to. If the aim is fewer abortions and healthier families, prevention and care must be central, not an afterthought.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by a balance of personal liberty, patient safety, and respect for the widely held belief that potential life deserves serious consideration. Practically, that looks like clear medical standards that protect timely care in emergencies and complicated pregnancies, alongside strong investments in contraception, sex education, prenatal care, and economic support for parents. When policy expands real options and avoids criminalizing people in crisis, it creates room for principled disagreement without needless harm.",
    "Abortion laws should be built around protecting health and dignity while acknowledging the moral seriousness many attach to developing life. A workable middle path keeps urgent medical decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians, sets clear and carefully defined exceptions for health crises and nonviable pregnancies, and prioritizes prevention through contraception access, accurate education, and robust support for parents and adoption. The goal should be fewer crises and less suffering, achieved through clarity, compassion, and real resources rather than punishment.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should recognize that people disagree deeply about when life deserves legal protection, yet most want women to be safe, families supported, and fewer unintended pregnancies. Policy can reflect that shared ground by keeping care timely and medically guided, drawing any limits with precise language and humane exceptions, and investing heavily in contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and economic supports that make parenting a realistic choice. The measure of success should be reduced harm, fewer desperate situations, and predictable rules doctors can follow.",
    "Abortion policy should aim for compassion and practicality: protect patients\u2019 health and privacy while taking seriously the value many place on unborn life. That means decisions should remain primarily medical, with clearly written protections for emergencies and severe fetal conditions, alongside broad efforts to prevent unwanted pregnancies through education and affordable contraception. If the law is paired with real support for families\u2014healthcare, childcare, and adoption services\u2014it can reduce abortions without criminalizing people in crisis.",
    "Good abortion laws should start from a shared commitment to human dignity\u2014of the pregnant person and of the developing life many believe deserves protection. A bridge is to ensure early, safe access with informed consent, allow later interventions when health or viability demands it, and write rules clearly enough that clinicians can act without fear in time-sensitive cases. At the same time, society should do more to reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, sex education, and the supports that make raising a child possible.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided less by slogans and more by reducing harm: preventing unintended pregnancy, protecting patient safety, and treating moral disagreement with humility. A durable compromise pairs privacy and medical judgment with reasonable, medically grounded guardrails and explicit exceptions for serious health threats and extreme circumstances. With strong investments in contraception, prenatal care, mental health services, and family support, the law can lower abortions and protect families without forcing one conscience on everyone.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by both respect for developing life and respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, dignity, and ability to make time-sensitive medical decisions with qualified clinicians. A workable middle ground pairs clear, medically grounded rules and exceptions for serious health risks, rape or incest, and nonviable pregnancies with major investments in prevention and support\u2014contraception access, accurate sex education, prenatal care, and resources for parenting and adoption. The aim should be fewer crisis pregnancies and less suffering, without turning private medical situations into political or criminal battles.",
    "Abortion laws should be guided by compassion, medical evidence, and a commitment to protect both vulnerable life and the safety and autonomy of the person who is pregnant. Common ground is possible when policies keep urgent health decisions in the exam room, define exceptions clearly so doctors can act, and focus on reducing unintended pregnancies through education, contraception, and strong family supports. Whatever limits exist, they should be predictable, humane, and designed to reduce harm rather than punish people in crisis.",
    "Laws on abortion should aim to balance moral concern for potential life with the reality that pregnancy can involve severe medical risk, trauma, and financial hardship that no legislature can anticipate in every case. A shared path forward is to protect timely care and privacy early in pregnancy, ensure clear exceptions when health or viability is at stake, and make prevention and support central\u2014affordable contraception, honest sex education, prenatal and postpartum care, and help for parents and adoption. The goal is fewer unwanted pregnancies and more stable families, achieved through support and clarity instead of stigma and fear.",
    "Abortion policy should be guided by human dignity: treating the value many place on unborn life seriously while also trusting patients and clinicians to navigate complex, time-sensitive circumstances. Broad agreement can form around clear medical standards, robust exceptions for threats to health and other extreme cases, and a strong safety net that reduces the pressures that drive abortion\u2014healthcare, childcare, housing stability, and contraception. When the law prioritizes prevention, safety, and fairness, it can reduce suffering without forcing one moral view onto everyone.",
    "Laws about abortion should be guided by practical compassion\u2014protecting health and safety, acknowledging genuine moral disagreement, and keeping coercion and politics out of medical care. A bridging approach combines early, confidential access and clear emergency protections with reasonable, evidence-based guardrails later on, written so clinicians aren\u2019t left guessing. At the same time, society should invest heavily in what most people want: fewer unintended pregnancies and stronger support for anyone who chooses to carry a pregnancy to term.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by both respect for developing life and respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, dignity, and ability to make time-sensitive medical decisions with qualified clinicians. A workable framework pairs any limits with clear, medically defined exceptions for threats to life or serious health risks, rape or incest, and severe fetal conditions, so doctors and families aren\u2019t forced into crisis by ambiguity. Common ground is reducing unintended pregnancies and hardship through contraception access, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, and real support for parenting or adoption.",
    "Abortion laws should aim to reduce harm in the real world: protect patient safety and privacy while acknowledging the moral seriousness many attach to potential life. That means keeping early decisions largely between a patient and clinician, and ensuring that any restrictions later in pregnancy are clear, evidence-based, and include robust exceptions for health emergencies and nonviable or devastating fetal diagnoses. The shared path forward is prevention and support\u2014contraception, education, healthcare, and economic help\u2014so fewer people face crisis pregnancies at all.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided less by punishment and more by compassion, medical reality, and a commitment to human dignity for everyone involved. They can recognize moral concern for unborn life while still refusing to force people to carry pregnancies that endanger their health or arise from violence, by writing precise exceptions that clinicians can apply without fear. The broadest agreement is to invest in the front end\u2014education, contraception, prenatal care, and family supports\u2014so choices are real and crises are rarer.",
    "A sustainable abortion policy should balance two truths: many want the law to honor potential life, and many want it to protect bodily autonomy and keep government out of the exam room. The compromise space is clear rules that protect early access and guarantee timely care in medical emergencies, alongside carefully defined guardrails later in pregnancy that do not criminalize patients or clinicians acting in good faith. Whatever the line, pairing it with prevention, adoption resources, and strong supports for parents is the most practical way to reduce abortions and suffering.",
    "Laws on abortion should be guided by practical outcomes\u2014health, safety, and fairness\u2014while taking seriously the moral convictions people hold about when life deserves legal protection. That points to policies that rely on medical evidence, protect informed consent, and ensure unambiguous exceptions for serious health threats and tragic fetal conditions, rather than one-size-fits-all mandates. Common ground grows when the law also expands contraception, sex education, and supports that make continuing a pregnancy genuinely feasible."
