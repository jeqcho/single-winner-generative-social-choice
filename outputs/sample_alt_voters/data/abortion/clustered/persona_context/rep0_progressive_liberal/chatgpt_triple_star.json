    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both personal autonomy and respect for developing human life by balancing the rights, health, and circumstances of the pregnant person with society\u2019s interest in potential life. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to safe, regulated care\u2014especially in cases involving risk to the patient\u2019s health, rape or incest, or severe fetal anomalies\u2014while allowing for reasonable, evidence-based limits that reflect increasing fetal development. Policy should also reduce the conditions that lead to unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and strong support for parents and children. Grounding decisions in medical expertise, privacy, and compassion can create rules that are enforceable, humane, and responsive to differing moral convictions."
