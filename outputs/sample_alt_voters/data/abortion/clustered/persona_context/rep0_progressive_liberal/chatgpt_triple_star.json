    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, while grounding policy in medical evidence and compassion for real-world circumstances. A workable approach is to protect broad access early in pregnancy, ensure clear exceptions later when a pregnancy threatens health or involves severe fetal anomalies, and avoid criminalizing patients or clinicians acting in good faith. Common ground can also include investing in prevention\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and social supports\u2014so fewer people face unwanted or medically risky pregnancies.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people hold sincere and differing moral views about when life merits legal protection. A workable approach is to set clear, evidence-based rules that ensure timely access to care early in pregnancy, include unambiguous exceptions for threats to life or serious health risks, and provide fair procedural safeguards so clinicians can act without fear when emergencies arise. Alongside legal standards, public policy should reduce unwanted pregnancies and the pressures that lead to abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and postpartum care, and economic supports for families.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for bodily autonomy, aiming to reduce harm and preserve dignity for all involved. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy with appropriate medical standards and informed consent, while allowing carefully defined regulations later that prioritize the pregnant person\u2019s health and account for fetal development. Regardless of one\u2019s moral view, policy should also emphasize prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and resources that help people carry pregnancies to term when they choose.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for individual bodily autonomy, recognizing that people hold sincere, deeply held moral and religious differences on when personhood begins. A workable approach is to protect access to early pregnancy abortion and essential medical care, while allowing carefully limited regulation later in pregnancy that includes clear exceptions for the health and life of the pregnant person, severe fetal conditions, and cases like rape or incest. Policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through better contraception access, comprehensive sex education, and support for parents and children, so fewer people face this decision in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with protection of pregnant people\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal participation in society, recognizing that citizens hold sincere and differing moral beliefs about when personhood begins. A workable middle ground is to ensure timely access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy, with clear protections for later-term care when serious health risks, nonviable pregnancies, or severe fetal conditions are involved. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and parenting support, and economic protections, while safeguarding patient privacy and allowing room for conscientious disagreement without denying essential care."
