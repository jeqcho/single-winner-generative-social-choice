    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a balanced commitment to protecting potential life while also respecting the pregnant person\u2019s health, bodily autonomy, and equal standing under the law. A reasonable middle ground is to ensure early access to safe, legal abortion, with increasing protections for fetal life as pregnancy progresses, while guaranteeing clear exceptions for rape, incest, severe fetal anomalies, and threats to the person\u2019s life or serious health. Policymakers should pair any legal limits with broad support for contraception, prenatal and maternal care, and social services so fewer people face unwanted or medically risky pregnancies, and the law remains compassionate and practical.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 bodily autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral status begins. A workable approach is to keep early access to abortion safe and legal while encouraging measures that reduce unintended pregnancies\u2014such as comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and support for parents\u2014and allowing carefully defined, medically grounded limits later in pregnancy with clear exceptions for threats to health, rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies. Policy should be evidence-based, protect privacy, and ensure that no one is forced into childbirth or unsafe procedures due to lack of resources.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by respect for both the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy and the widely held concern for developing fetal life, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral status begins. A workable approach is to protect access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based limits later, always preserving exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and serious health risks, and for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare supports, and unbiased medical counseling, while safeguarding patient privacy and clinicians\u2019 ability to provide appropriate care.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential human life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s autonomy, health, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people hold sincere and deeply held moral views on when life deserves legal protection. A workable consensus is to protect access early in pregnancy and to ensure later decisions remain available when there are serious risks to the patient\u2019s health, severe fetal anomalies, or circumstances such as rape or incest, while encouraging earlier care through accurate information and timely access. Policy should also reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and parenting support, and strong maternal healthcare.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the autonomy, health, and dignity of the pregnant person, recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious differences about when life merits legal protection. A workable approach is to protect access at least in early pregnancy and to ensure clear, timely exceptions later for threats to life or serious health, severe fetal conditions, and pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and postnatal care, and economic supports for families."
