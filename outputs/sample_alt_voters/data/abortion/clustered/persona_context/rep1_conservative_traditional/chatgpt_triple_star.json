    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for pregnant people\u2019s autonomy, health, and life circumstances, recognizing that sincere moral and religious views differ on when personhood begins. A workable approach is to ensure early access to safe, legal care while allowing increasing regulation later in pregnancy that includes clear exceptions for threats to life or serious health risks, and for cases like rape or incest. At the same time, policy should reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong supports for parents and children."
