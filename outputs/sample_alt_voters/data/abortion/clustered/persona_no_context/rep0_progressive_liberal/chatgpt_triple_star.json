    "Laws on abortion should protect individuals\u2019 health, autonomy, and ability to make private medical decisions while recognizing society\u2019s interest in supporting potential life through practical measures such as accessible prenatal care, effective contraception, and social supports for parenting. Policy should be grounded in medical evidence, minimize harm, respect sincerely held moral differences, and provide clear, compassionate exceptions for cases of serious risk to the pregnant person, incest, or rape, with safeguards to ensure equitable access and informed consent."
