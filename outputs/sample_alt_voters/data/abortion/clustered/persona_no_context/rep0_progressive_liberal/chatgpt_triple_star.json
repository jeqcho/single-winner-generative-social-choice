    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect the moral seriousness many attach to fetal life while also protecting the health, safety, and autonomy of pregnant people. A workable approach combines reasonable, evidence-based limits that reflect increasing fetal development with clear exceptions for threats to life or serious health, cases of rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies, while ensuring timely access to medical care. Policymakers should prioritize reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and support for parents, so fewer people face this decision in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral seriousness many people attach to fetal life and the fundamental health, safety, and autonomy needs of pregnant individuals. A workable middle ground is to ensure timely access to safe, legal care\u2014especially in cases of serious health risk, rape or incest, or severe fetal anomalies\u2014while supporting informed consent, reasonable gestational frameworks that reflect medical evidence, and robust social supports that reduce unwanted pregnancies. Policy should be guided by compassion, scientific and medical expertise, and a commitment to minimizing harm, rather than by forcing any single moral or religious view on everyone.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s autonomy, health, and life circumstances, acknowledging that people hold sincere moral and religious differences about when personhood begins. A workable consensus is to ensure early access to safe, legal care and accurate information, while allowing increasing protections for fetal development later in pregnancy, with clear exceptions for threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or serious health risks, rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies. Policymakers should also reduce the need for abortion through widely supported measures like comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, maternal health care, and social supports for parents.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should protect both respect for potential life and the autonomy, health, and dignity of pregnant people, recognizing that citizens hold sincere and differing moral views. A workable approach is to ensure early, safe, and legal access while allowing more regulation later in pregnancy, with clear exceptions when the pregnant person\u2019s life or serious health is at risk, in cases of rape or incest, or when severe fetal conditions are involved. Alongside legal standards, governments should reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and robust social and economic supports for parents.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a balanced commitment to protecting potential life while respecting the autonomy, health, and equal citizenship of pregnant people. A reasonable framework can recognize moral disagreement by allowing access early in pregnancy and ensuring later restrictions include clear exceptions for life, serious health risks, and pregnancies that are nonviable or the result of rape or incest. Across all viewpoints, common ground includes reducing unintended pregnancies through education and contraception, providing robust prenatal and parenting supports, and ensuring decisions are made with accurate medical information and compassionate care."
