    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy and health, recognizing that sincere moral and religious views differ. A workable approach protects access early in pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, or incest, while allowing increasing protections for fetal development later on, guided by medical evidence rather than politics. Policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and support for parents, and ensure compassionate, nonjudgmental care and informed consent for anyone facing these decisions."
