    "Laws concerning abortion should protect the health, autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people while recognizing society\u2019s interest in supporting potential life through reasonable limits and safeguards. Policy should ensure safe, accessible reproductive care, meaningful support for parenting and alternatives like adoption, and thoughtful, evidence-based restrictions only when necessary to protect public health and widely shared ethical concerns."
