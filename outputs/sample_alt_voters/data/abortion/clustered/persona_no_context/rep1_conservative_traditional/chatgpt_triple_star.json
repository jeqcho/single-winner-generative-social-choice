    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with protection of individual autonomy and health, recognizing that people sincerely differ on when moral personhood begins. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to safe medical care\u2014especially in early pregnancy\u2014while allowing reasonable, evidence-based regulations that increase with fetal development and include clear exceptions for risks to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health, severe fetal anomalies, and pregnancies from rape or incest. Policy should also prioritize prevention and support through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and resources for parents, reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion."
