    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral seriousness many attach to fetal life and the fundamental interests in a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship. A workable consensus is to protect access to safe, legal abortion at least in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, incest, or severe fetal anomaly, while allowing measured, evidence-based regulations later in pregnancy that do not impose undue burdens. Policy should be paired with robust support for contraception, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and social services so fewer people face unwanted or medically risky pregnancies.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential human life with respect for the autonomy, health, and dignity of the pregnant person, recognizing that people hold sincere and deeply different moral beliefs. A broadly acceptable approach is to protect access to timely, safe medical care early in pregnancy, allow later restrictions that include clear exceptions for threats to life or health and for severe fetal anomalies, and ensure decisions are guided by medical evidence and due process rather than punishment. At the same time, society should reduce unwanted pregnancies and the pressures that lead to abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and meaningful support for parents and children.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to balance respect for potential life with the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and lived circumstances, recognizing that people hold sincere and differing moral beliefs about when rights and personhood begin. A workable consensus is to protect access early in pregnancy and to ensure clear, reliable exceptions later for threats to life or health, severe fetal anomalies, and cases such as rape or incest. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and childcare support, and unbiased medical counseling, while leaving medical decisions primarily to patients and qualified clinicians rather than criminal law.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for developing fetal life with protection of a pregnant person\u2019s health, bodily autonomy, and equal participation in society, acknowledging that people differ on when moral status begins. A workable consensus is to ensure timely access early in pregnancy, with clear, medically grounded protections and broader discretion when there are serious risks to health, fatal fetal conditions, or pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Policy should prioritize reducing unintended pregnancies through education and contraception, provide support for parents and children, and rely on evidence-based medical standards rather than punitive enforcement.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should seek to balance respect for potential life with respect for pregnant people\u2019s autonomy, health, and equal participation in society, recognizing that citizens hold sincere and differing moral beliefs. A workable approach is to protect access to safe, legal abortion\u2014especially early in pregnancy\u2014while allowing carefully limited, evidence-based protections for fetal interests later in pregnancy, with clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health and for situations such as rape or incest. Policy should also prioritize prevention and support by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and resources for parents, so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and more can carry pregnancies safely when they choose."
