    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy with a societal interest in protecting potential life, ensuring that decisions are made safely, compassionately, and with access to accurate information and medical care. Policy should protect people\u2019s ability to make private health decisions while supporting measures that reduce the need for abortion\u2014such as comprehensive sex education, accessible contraception, maternal health services, and social supports\u2014so that fewer people face the choice under duress."
