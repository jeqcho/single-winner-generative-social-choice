    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with protection of the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, while recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious disagreements about when personhood begins. A workable consensus is to ensure early access to abortion with strong informed-consent and support services, alongside increasing protections as pregnancy advances, with clear exceptions for threats to life or serious health, rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies. Policy should also prioritize reducing unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, maternal healthcare, and economic supports for families.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with the reality that pregnancy profoundly affects a person\u2019s health, autonomy, and future, aiming to reduce harm rather than impose a single moral view. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy, ensure clear exceptions later for the pregnant person\u2019s life or serious health risks and for cases like rape or incest, and require that any regulations be evidence-based and not create undue barriers to timely care. At the same time, policy should invest in prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and resources for parents and adoption\u2014so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and fewer abortions occur.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 autonomy and health with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, recognizing that sincere moral and religious convictions differ. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to safe medical care\u2014especially in cases of serious health risk, rape, or incest\u2014while allowing proportionate, evidence-based regulations that increase with fetal development and do not create undue burdens. Policy should also reduce unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong support for parents and children, so fewer people face this decision in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for fetal life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal participation in society, recognizing that people hold sincere and deeply held moral views on both sides. A workable consensus is to protect access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy, allow increasing regulation as fetal development advances, and preserve clear exceptions for threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or serious health, as well as cases like rape or incest. Alongside any legal framework, policymakers should expand support for contraception, prenatal and maternal healthcare, adoption services, and economic assistance so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and no one is forced into unsafe options.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy and health, recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious disagreements about when personhood begins. A broadly acceptable approach protects access early in pregnancy and guarantees care in cases of serious health risk, rape, or fetal nonviability, while allowing increasing regulation later in pregnancy grounded in medical evidence. Policy should also focus on shared goals\u2014reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and robust support for parents\u2014so fewer people face the decision in the first place."
