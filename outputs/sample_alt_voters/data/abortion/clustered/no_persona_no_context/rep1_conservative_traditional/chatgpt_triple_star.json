    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral value many place on potential life and the fundamental importance of bodily autonomy and health for pregnant people. A workable middle ground is to protect access to abortion early in pregnancy and to ensure later-term abortions remain available when serious medical risks, severe fetal conditions, or other exceptional circumstances arise, with decisions guided by patients and qualified clinicians rather than politics. Policy should also reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and parental support, and accessible healthcare."
