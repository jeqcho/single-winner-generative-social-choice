    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both bodily autonomy and the potential value of developing life by grounding policy in evidence-based medicine, respect for individual conscience, and compassion for complex circumstances. A balanced approach can allow access early in pregnancy while permitting carefully defined limits later, with clear exceptions to protect the pregnant person\u2019s life and health and in cases such as rape or severe fetal anomaly. Regardless of one\u2019s moral view, common ground includes reducing unintended pregnancies and supporting families through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and social supports.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both respect for potential life and the health, autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people, recognizing that citizens hold deeply different moral and religious convictions. A workable framework can permit access early in pregnancy, ensure clear exceptions for threats to life and serious health risks, and provide fair processes for complex cases later in pregnancy. At the same time, policy should reduce unwanted pregnancies and abortions through evidence-based sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and parenting supports, and robust maternal health care.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people hold sincere and deeply different moral views. A workable consensus is to protect access early in pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, incest, or severe fetal anomalies, while allowing greater regulation later in pregnancy that is grounded in medical evidence and does not create undue burdens. Alongside any legal framework, society should invest in contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and postnatal care, and economic supports so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and no one is forced into unsafe or desperate situations.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for developing fetal life with protection of a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people hold sincere, conflicting moral views about when personhood begins. A workable consensus is to ensure access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy, allow later abortions when serious health risks or severe fetal anomalies are present, and pair any limits with real supports\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postnatal care, and economic assistance\u2014to reduce unintended pregnancies and make parenthood a genuine choice. Policymaking should be grounded in medical evidence, safeguard patient privacy, and avoid criminalizing patients or clinicians.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for pregnant people\u2019s autonomy, health, and dignity, acknowledging that people differ deeply on when moral personhood begins. A workable consensus is to protect access early in pregnancy and ensure access later when serious health risks or severe fetal anomalies are involved, while also allowing reasonable, evidence-based regulations that do not create undue barriers. Policy should pair any legal framework with strong support for contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and social services so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and no one is forced into unsafe options."
