    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the bodily autonomy and health of the pregnant person, recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious differences about when personhood begins. A workable approach can protect access early in pregnancy, allow later limits with clear exceptions for serious health risks, rape or incest, and nonviable pregnancies, and ensure decisions are guided by medical evidence rather than politics. Alongside any legal framework, society should invest in contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and support for parents so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and fewer abortions are needed."
