A durable framework pairs access early in pregnancy with carefully defined, medically grounded limits later, and with clear exceptions for threats to life or health, rape/incest, and severe fetal anomalies, so clinicians can act without delay. Alongside any legal standards, governments should expand contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and mental-health care, and material support for families, so fewer people face pregnancy decisions under crisis or coercion.",
