    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by respect for human dignity and moral diversity, balancing the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and life circumstances with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life. A workable approach protects access to timely, safe care\u2014especially in cases of medical risk, rape, incest, or severe fetal conditions\u2014while allowing reasonable, evidence-based limits as pregnancy progresses. It should also prioritize prevention and support through contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and postnatal healthcare, and resources that help people carry pregnancies to term when they choose.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for bodily autonomy with recognition of the moral significance many people place on potential life, aiming to reduce harm and preserve dignity for those involved. A workable middle ground protects access early in pregnancy, allows later restrictions with clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health, and ensures decisions remain guided by medical judgment rather than politics. At the same time, policy should invest in preventing unintended pregnancies and supporting parents and children through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and economic supports so fewer people face this decision.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and ability to make decisions in complex circumstances. A workable consensus is to protect access early in pregnancy and to ensure clear exceptions later for serious threats to health or life and for pregnancies involving severe fetal anomalies, while setting transparent, medically grounded standards rather than punitive measures. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and social supports, so fewer people face crisis decisions.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, recognizing that sincere moral and religious convictions differ. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy and to ensure clear exceptions later for serious health risks, fetal conditions incompatible with life, and pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, while allowing reasonable regulations that safeguard informed consent and medical standards without creating undue burdens. Policy should be evidence-based, support contraception and comprehensive sex education, and expand prenatal, birth, and parenting supports so fewer people face unwanted or medically precarious pregnancies in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal participation in society, recognizing that people hold sincere, deeply different moral convictions. A workable middle ground is to protect access early in pregnancy and to ensure later restrictions include clear exceptions for threats to life or health, severe fetal conditions, and pregnancies from rape or incest, while requiring decisions remain primarily between the patient and qualified clinicians. Public policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption so fewer people feel forced into any outcome."
