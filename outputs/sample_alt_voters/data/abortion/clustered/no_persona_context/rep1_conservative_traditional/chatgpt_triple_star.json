    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral value many place on potential life and the bodily autonomy and health needs of pregnant people. A workable middle ground is to protect access to safe, legal abortion at least early in pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape or incest, while allowing greater regulation later based on medical viability and individual circumstances. Policy should be guided by medical evidence, compassion, and due process, alongside robust support for contraception, prenatal care, and social services so fewer people face unwanted or medically risky pregnancies."
