A balanced approach keeps early pregnancy decisions private and accessible, guarantees prompt treatment for miscarriages and emergencies, and sets later-pregnancy limits only when they are medically workable and include explicit exceptions for life and serious health threats, rape or incest, and lethal fetal diagnoses\u2014without criminal penalties for patients or clinicians acting in good faith. Whatever gestational line is chosen, governments should reduce crisis pregnancies by expanding contraception and evidence-based education, and by providing real support for pregnancy, birth, parenting, and adoption.",

A workable framework protects timely, safe, and private care early in pregnancy, keeps medical emergencies legal and accessible at all times, and sets clearer later-pregnancy guardrails tied to medical evidence and clinician judgment, with explicit exceptions for rape, incest, fatal fetal conditions, and serious threats to life or health\u2014without criminalizing patients or doctors acting in good faith. Common ground is strongest when any legal approach is paired with proven prevention and support: accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical resources for parenting and adoption so fewer pregnancies become crises.",
