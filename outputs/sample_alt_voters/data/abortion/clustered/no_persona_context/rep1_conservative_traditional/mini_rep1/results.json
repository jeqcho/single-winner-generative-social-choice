That means ensuring prompt, confidential access early in pregnancy and guaranteeing nationwide, medically defined protections for emergencies, severe health threats, nonviable pregnancies, and pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, without criminal penalties that deter care. As pregnancy advances, any limits should be tied to viability and clinical evidence, with decisions governed by licensed medical judgment rather than politics. Policy should also prioritize prevention and real choice by expanding contraception, accurate sex education, maternal healthcare, and practical supports for parenting and adoption.",
