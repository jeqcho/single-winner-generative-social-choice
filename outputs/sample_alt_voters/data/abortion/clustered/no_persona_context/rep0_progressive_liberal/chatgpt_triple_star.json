    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for developing human life with respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 autonomy, health, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral personhood begins. A workable approach protects access to timely abortion care early in pregnancy, ensures exceptions for threats to life and serious health, and allows carefully tailored limits later in pregnancy that are evidence-based and do not create undue burdens. At the same time, policy should reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, maternal health care, and social supports for parents, while keeping decisions grounded in medical expertise and privacy.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual bodily autonomy with a meaningful interest in protecting developing life, while recognizing that people hold sincere, differing moral beliefs about when life warrants legal protection. A workable consensus is to keep abortion broadly accessible early in pregnancy, with increasing safeguards and limits later on, alongside clear exceptions for threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health and for severe fetal conditions. In all cases, policy should prioritize evidence-based medicine, privacy, and practical supports\u2014such as contraception access, prenatal and postpartum care, and economic assistance\u2014so fewer people face unwanted or medically risky pregnancies in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal participation in society, recognizing that reasonable people disagree about when moral status begins. A workable consensus is to protect access in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, or fatal fetal anomaly, while allowing greater regulation later in pregnancy when fetal viability becomes possible, provided exceptions for medical necessity remain clear and practical. Policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortions by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and economic supports for parents.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both personal autonomy and the value many place on potential life, while recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral status begins. A reasonable approach is to ensure access to timely, safe care early in pregnancy and to allow later-term abortions when there are serious threats to the pregnant person\u2019s health, severe fetal anomalies, or other exceptional circumstances, paired with clear medical standards and due process. At the same time, policy should reduce unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust supports for parents, so fewer people face this decision in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for developing human life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal participation in society. A workable middle ground is to protect broad access early in pregnancy, allow later abortion when serious health risks, severe fetal conditions, or compelling circumstances are present, and pair any limits with clear medical exceptions and timely, affordable care. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, access to contraception, prenatal and childcare support, and evidence-based health standards rather than punitive enforcement."
