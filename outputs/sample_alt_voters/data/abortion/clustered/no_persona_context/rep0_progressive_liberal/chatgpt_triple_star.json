    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral value many place on developing life and the rights, health, and autonomy of pregnant individuals, especially in complex or high-risk circumstances. A workable approach is to protect access to safe medical care early in pregnancy, allow clear exceptions later for serious threats to life or health and for cases like rape or incest, and pair any limits with strong support for contraception, prenatal care, adoption services, and economic assistance so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies. The goal should be reducing harm and preserving dignity by relying on medical evidence, due process, and policies that help families and children thrive."
