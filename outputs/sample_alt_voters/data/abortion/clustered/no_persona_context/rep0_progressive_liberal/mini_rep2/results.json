In a society with deep moral disagreement, a balanced framework can preserve early pregnancy decision-making while permitting carefully written, democratically set protections for fetal life later in pregnancy, with explicit exceptions for health, rape or incest, and profound fetal anomalies. Whatever limits exist, the most broadly unifying strategy is to prevent desperation through affordable contraception, evidence-based education, and sustained support for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption.",
