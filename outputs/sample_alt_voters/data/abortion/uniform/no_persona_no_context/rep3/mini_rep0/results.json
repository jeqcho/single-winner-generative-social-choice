A durable framework sets clear, medically grounded rules with strong protections for emergencies and complex cases, and avoids punitive enforcement that drives care underground. At the same time, it reduces the number of crisis pregnancies through contraception access, accurate education, and concrete support for parenting and adoption so fewer people feel forced into any outcome.",
