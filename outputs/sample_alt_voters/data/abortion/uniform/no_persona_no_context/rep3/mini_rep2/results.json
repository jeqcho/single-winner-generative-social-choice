A workable approach keeps medical decisions grounded in clinical evidence, includes clear exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to health, and avoids criminalizing patients or doctors acting in good faith. To lower the number of abortions and strengthen families, policy should also expand access to contraception, accurate education, prenatal and maternal care, and practical supports like childcare, paid leave, and economic assistance.",
