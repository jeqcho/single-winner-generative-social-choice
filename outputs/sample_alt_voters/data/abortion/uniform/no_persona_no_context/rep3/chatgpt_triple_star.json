    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral weight many place on potential life and the fundamental health, dignity, and autonomy of pregnant individuals. A workable middle ground protects access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, incest, or severe fetal anomaly, while allowing measured limits later in pregnancy that include clear medical exceptions and do not create barriers to urgent care. Policy should also reduce unwanted pregnancies and abortions through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong supports for parents and children."
