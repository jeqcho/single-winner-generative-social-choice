    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and capacity to make decisions in consultation with medical professionals. A workable middle ground is to protect access early in pregnancy and always when a pregnancy threatens life or serious health, while allowing carefully tailored limits later in pregnancy that include clear medical exceptions and do not criminalize patients or clinicians. Policies should also reduce the circumstances that lead to abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and economic supports for families.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should seek to respect both the moral value many place on potential life and the fundamental importance of a pregnant person\u2019s health, dignity, and ability to make medical decisions. A balanced approach can protect access to safe, timely care\u2014especially in cases involving risks to health, rape or incest, or severe fetal conditions\u2014while allowing for reasonable, evidence-based limits as pregnancy progresses. Policy should prioritize reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong social supports for parents, and ensure any regulations are medically informed, consistent, and do not create dangerous barriers to care.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 autonomy and health with society\u2019s interest in protecting developing life, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral and legal protections should begin. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare\u2014especially in early pregnancy\u2014while allowing more regulation later in pregnancy, with clear exceptions to protect the pregnant person\u2019s life and physical health and in cases of severe fetal anomaly. Policy should also reduce unwanted pregnancies through education, contraception access, and support for parents, and be grounded in medical evidence and privacy protections rather than stigma or punishment.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 autonomy, health, and life circumstances, recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious differences about when personhood begins. A workable approach protects access at least in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risks, rape, or incest, while allowing increasing safeguards as pregnancy progresses alongside meaningful exceptions. Policy should also focus on shared goals\u2014reducing unintended pregnancies and supporting parents\u2014through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and social supports so fewer people face this decision.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and life circumstances, recognizing that people hold sincere, differing moral views about when protection should begin. A practical consensus is to ensure early access to safe, legal care, while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy that include clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health, severe fetal conditions, and pregnancies from rape or incest. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and parenting support, and robust healthcare, so fewer people face crisis decisions."
