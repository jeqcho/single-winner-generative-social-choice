A workable framework should be grounded in medical evidence and clinical judgment, with clear, non-negotiable exceptions for life-threatening or serious health circumstances and other complex cases, plus transparent, humane standards that avoid punitive confusion for patients and clinicians. Common ground is strongest in preventing unwanted pregnancies and reducing abortions through contraception access, accurate education, prenatal and maternal care, and real economic and childcare supports that make parenting or adoption genuinely feasible.",

Whatever legal limits a state sets, they should include clear, clinician-led exceptions for life-threatening emergencies, severe health risks, and nonviable or catastrophic fetal conditions, written in plain language so patients and doctors aren\u2019t forced into delay. Common ground also means reducing unintended pregnancies and hardship through access to contraception and accurate education, plus prenatal care and real economic support for parenting and adoption. A humane approach focuses on prevention and support over punishment, and measures success by better health outcomes and fewer families in crisis.",
