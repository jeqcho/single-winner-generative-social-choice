    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with protection of pregnant people\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal standing in society, while recognizing that citizens differ in good faith about when moral personhood begins. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to safe, legal care early in pregnancy and to allow later restrictions that include clear, enforceable exceptions for threats to life or serious health, severe fetal anomalies, and pregnancies from rape or incest, alongside supportive measures that reduce unwanted pregnancies. Policy should be guided by medical evidence, compassion, and practical outcomes\u2014reducing harm, supporting families, and avoiding criminalization of patients and clinicians for necessary care."
