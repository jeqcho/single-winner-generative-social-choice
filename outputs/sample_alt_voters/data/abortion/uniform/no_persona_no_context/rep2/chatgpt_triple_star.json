    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both bodily autonomy and the potential value of developing life by setting clear, medically informed standards that reflect the different moral convictions people hold. A workable middle ground is to ensure early access to safe, legal abortion while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy, with exceptions for serious health risks, rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and economic supports for families.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both potential life and the health, autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people, recognizing that citizens hold sincere and differing moral views about when life begins. A balanced approach can allow early access to abortion while permitting increasing regulation later in pregnancy, with clear exceptions to safeguard a patient\u2019s life and serious health and to address cases like rape or incest. At the same time, policy should reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion by expanding contraception, evidence-based sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and nonjudgmental counseling.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 bodily autonomy with a serious recognition of developing fetal life, aiming to reduce harm and preserve dignity on all sides. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy while allowing carefully defined regulations later that include clear medical exceptions and consider circumstances such as severe fetal anomalies. At the same time, governments should expand contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and healthcare so fewer people face unwanted or medically risky pregnancies in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 bodily autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting developing human life, while acknowledging that people differ deeply on when moral status begins. A workable approach protects access early in pregnancy, allows later restrictions with clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and serious health risks, and ensures compassionate consideration of cases like rape, incest, and severe fetal anomalies. Across all views, policy should also expand contraception access, prenatal and postnatal support, and unbiased medical information so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and more families can thrive.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral significance many people place on developing life and the pregnant person\u2019s rights, health, and ability to make decisions about their own body. A workable approach is to protect access to safe, legal abortion at least in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risks, rape, or fatal fetal conditions, while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy with clear medical exceptions. Policymakers should also invest in measures that reduce unintended pregnancies and support families\u2014such as comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and childcare\u2014so fewer people face this decision in the first place."
