    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral significance many people place on developing fetal life and the fundamental health, safety, and autonomy interests of pregnant individuals. A workable middle ground protects access to abortion at least in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, incest, or nonviable pregnancies, while allowing carefully limited regulations later in pregnancy that do not create undue burdens or interfere with medical judgment. Policymakers should pair any legal framework with strong support for contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and maternal care, and social services so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and more families can thrive."
