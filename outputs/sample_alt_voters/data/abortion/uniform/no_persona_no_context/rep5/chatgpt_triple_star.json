    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, bodily autonomy, and life circumstances, acknowledging that people differ deeply on when moral status begins. A workable consensus is to protect access early in pregnancy and to ensure clear exceptions later for serious health risks, nonviable pregnancies, and cases like rape or incest, alongside fair procedures and medical privacy. Policy should also reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through evidence-based sex education, contraception access, prenatal care, and social supports for parenting and adoption.",
    "Laws on abortion should respect both the serious moral concerns about potential human life and the need to protect the health, autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people. A balanced approach can allow access\u2014especially early in pregnancy and in cases of rape, incest, fatal fetal conditions, or serious health risks\u2014while permitting reasonable, evidence-based limits later on, paired with clear medical exceptions. Common ground also includes reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and strong social supports for parents and children.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, aiming to reduce harm and protect human dignity. A reasonable middle ground is to permit abortion early in pregnancy, allow later abortion when there are serious risks to the pregnant person\u2019s health or severe fetal anomalies, and ensure decisions remain primarily between patients and qualified clinicians. At the same time, policy should focus on preventing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust support for parents and children so fewer people face this decision.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral concern many people have for potential human life and the autonomy, health, and dignity of pregnant individuals. A workable consensus is to keep abortion legal and accessible early in pregnancy, while allowing increasing protections for fetal life later on, with clear exceptions for threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or serious health risks, and for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through contraception access, accurate sex education, prenatal support, and resources that make parenting or adoption realistic options.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and lived circumstances, recognizing that people differ deeply on when moral personhood begins. A workable approach is to protect broad access early in pregnancy, allow later restrictions that increase with fetal development while always preserving clear exceptions for serious health risks, rape or incest, and nonviable pregnancies. Policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and support for parents, aiming to make abortion rarer without criminalizing those facing difficult decisions."
