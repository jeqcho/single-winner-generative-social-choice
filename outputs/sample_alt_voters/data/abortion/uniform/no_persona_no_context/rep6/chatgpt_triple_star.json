    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for bodily autonomy and the health and circumstances of the pregnant person, recognizing that people disagree deeply about when moral status begins. A workable consensus is to protect access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy, allow reasonable regulations tied to medical evidence (not punishment), and provide clear exceptions for threats to life or health, severe fetal anomalies, and pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. At the same time, policy should reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and parenting support, and social services so that fewer people face the decision in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for personal autonomy and health with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral status begins. A reasonable consensus is to ensure timely access to safe, regulated care\u2014especially in cases of medical risk, rape, or incest\u2014while allowing greater protections as pregnancy progresses, with exceptions to preserve the pregnant person\u2019s life and serious health. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion through evidence-based sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal support, and resources that help people carry pregnancies to term if they choose.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and freedom of conscience, while recognizing that people hold sincere and deeply different moral views. A workable consensus is to protect access early in pregnancy and ensure clear exceptions at any stage for threats to life or serious health, lethal fetal conditions, and pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, with decisions guided by medical standards and patient\u2013clinician judgment. Public policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and postpartum care, and economic supports for families.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people differ deeply on when moral personhood begins. A workable middle ground is to protect early access to abortion, ensure later-pregnancy decisions are guided by serious health risks and fetal conditions, and guarantee clear exceptions for the life and health of the patient, including in cases of rape or incest. Policy should also reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through evidence-based sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and social supports for families. Decisions and regulations should be medically informed, transparent, and designed to minimize harm while preserving space for individual conscience.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral weight many place on potential human life and the importance of bodily autonomy, health, and equal citizenship for pregnant people. A workable middle ground is to protect access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy, ensure timely exceptions when a pregnancy endangers health or involves rape or incest, and pair limits later in pregnancy with clear medical discretion and due-process safeguards. Alongside legal rules, governments should reduce unwanted pregnancies and hardship through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, prenatal and parental support, and nonjudgmental counseling so fewer people face this decision."
