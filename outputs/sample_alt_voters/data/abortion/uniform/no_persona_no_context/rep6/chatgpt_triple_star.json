    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and ability to make deeply personal medical decisions. A practical middle ground is to protect access early in pregnancy and to ensure later restrictions include clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health, severe fetal conditions, and circumstances like rape or incest, while avoiding medically unnecessary barriers. Policy should be guided by evidence-based medicine, consistent standards of care, and support for reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and robust prenatal and parenting resources."
