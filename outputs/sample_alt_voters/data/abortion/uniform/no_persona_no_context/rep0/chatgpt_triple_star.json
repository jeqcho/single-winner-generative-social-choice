    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual bodily autonomy with recognition that many people place moral value on developing fetal life. A consensus approach is to protect early, safe, and legal access while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy that include clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s health, severe fetal conditions, and pregnancies from rape or incest. Policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies and the demand for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and social supports that make carrying a pregnancy to term more feasible."
