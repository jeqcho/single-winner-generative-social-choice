    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for pregnant people\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal participation in society, recognizing that citizens hold sincere, differing moral views about when moral status begins. A workable middle ground protects access to timely, safe care\u2014especially in cases involving serious health risks, rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies\u2014while allowing reasonable, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy that include clear medical-exception safeguards. Policy should also prioritize shared goals that reduce unintended pregnancies and the number of abortions through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and family supports.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with the pregnant person\u2019s autonomy, health, and lived circumstances, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral rights begin. A workable approach is to protect access to safe, legal abortion at least in early pregnancy, while allowing increasing regulation later that is grounded in medical evidence and includes clear exceptions for rape or incest, serious fetal conditions, and threats to the patient\u2019s life or health. Whatever the limits, policy should prioritize reducing unintended pregnancies through education, contraception access, and social supports, and ensure decisions are made with privacy and high-quality medical care rather than stigma or coercion.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for pregnant people\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal participation in society. A workable middle ground protects access early in pregnancy and guarantees care when a pregnancy threatens a patient\u2019s life or serious health, while allowing carefully limited regulation later in pregnancy tied to medical evidence and individual circumstances. Policymaking should focus on shared goals\u2014reducing unintended pregnancies through education and contraception, ensuring informed consent and safety, and supporting families and children\u2014rather than punishing people in crisis.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral seriousness many attach to potential human life and the fundamental importance of protecting a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal standing under the law. A workable approach is to ensure timely, safe access at least in early pregnancy and in cases of risk to health, rape, or incest, while allowing measured, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy that include clear medical exceptions and avoid undue burdens. Policy should also prioritize prevention by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and social supports so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and no one is forced into unsafe options.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to balance respect for developing human life with respect for individual bodily autonomy, guided by medical evidence and compassion rather than ideology. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy, allow later restrictions with clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health and for severe fetal conditions, and ensure due process in hard cases. Across all views, society can agree on reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong supports for parents, so fewer people face this decision in the first place."
