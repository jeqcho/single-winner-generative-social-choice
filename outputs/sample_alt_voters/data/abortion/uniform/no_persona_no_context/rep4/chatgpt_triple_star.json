    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, aiming to reduce harm and protect health in difficult, real-world circumstances. A reasonable approach is to allow access early in pregnancy, provide clear exceptions later for serious risks to the patient\u2019s health, nonviable pregnancies, and pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, while ensuring decisions are guided by medical expertise rather than politics. At the same time, society should invest in preventing unintended pregnancies and supporting parents and children\u2014through contraception access, comprehensive education, prenatal care, and economic supports\u2014so fewer people face this decision in the first place."
