    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for bodily autonomy, while recognizing that people hold sincere, deeply rooted beliefs on both sides. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy, allow increasing regulation as gestation advances, and ensure clear exceptions when a pregnant person\u2019s life or health is at serious risk, in cases of rape or incest, or when a fetus has a condition incompatible with life. At the same time, policy should reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, maternal health care, and meaningful support for parents.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and freedom of conscience, recognizing that people hold sincere and differing moral beliefs about when life deserves legal protection. A workable consensus is to ensure timely access to safe, legal abortion at least in early pregnancy and always in cases of serious health risk, rape, incest, or nonviable pregnancy, while allowing carefully limited, evidence-based restrictions later in pregnancy that do not undermine medical judgment or create undue burdens. At the same time, policy should reduce unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust support for prenatal care, childcare, and families, so fewer people feel forced into any decision.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral rights begin. A workable consensus is to protect access early in pregnancy, ensure later-term abortions remain available when serious health risks, fatal fetal conditions, or profound hardship are present, and to pair any limits with clear medical exceptions guided by clinicians rather than criminal penalties. Regardless of one\u2019s stance, policy should prioritize reducing unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal support, and practical assistance for parents.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential human life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s autonomy, health, and life circumstances, recognizing that sincere moral convictions differ. A workable approach is to protect access to safe, timely care\u2014especially early in pregnancy and in cases of rape, incest, or serious fetal anomalies\u2014while allowing carefully limited regulation later in pregnancy that includes clear exceptions to safeguard the patient\u2019s life and health. Alongside legal rules, society should invest in contraception, sex education, prenatal and parenting support, and economic assistance so that fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and fewer feel compelled toward abortion.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for fetal life with the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and ability to make informed decisions. A workable consensus is to protect access early in pregnancy, allow later abortions when serious health risks or severe fetal anomalies are present, and pair any limits with clear medical exceptions, timely care, and due process that keeps medical decisions primarily between patient and clinician. Alongside legal rules, society can reduce abortions by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and child supports, and resources that make parenthood more feasible."
