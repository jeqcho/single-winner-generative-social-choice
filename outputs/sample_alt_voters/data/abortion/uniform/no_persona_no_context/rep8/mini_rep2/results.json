A practical middle path is to set clear, evidence-based rules that leave room for clinician judgment in complex cases and avoid criminalizing patients, paired with strong investments in contraception, accurate education, maternal healthcare, and economic supports for families and adoption. The aim is fewer unwanted pregnancies and fewer tragic outcomes, achieved through care, clarity, and support rather than stigma or punishment.",
