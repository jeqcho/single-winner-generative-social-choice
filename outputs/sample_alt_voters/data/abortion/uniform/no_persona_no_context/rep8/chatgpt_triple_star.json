    "Abortion laws should be guided by a balanced commitment to protecting potential life while respecting the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and lived circumstances. A consensus approach can pair clear, medically grounded access\u2014especially in early pregnancy and in cases of risk to health, rape, or severe fetal anomaly\u2014with policies that reduce unwanted pregnancies through contraception, comprehensive sex education, and robust support for parents. Decisions should prioritize evidence-based medical standards, privacy, and compassion, while allowing limited, transparent regulation that promotes safety without imposing undue burdens.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for pregnant people\u2019s health, autonomy, and equality, recognizing that citizens hold sincere, deeply held moral and religious differences. A workable approach is to protect broad access early in pregnancy and to ensure exceptions later when there are serious risks to the patient\u2019s life or health, severe fetal anomalies, or pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, while setting clear medical standards and due-process protections. Policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong support for parents and children, so fewer people face this decision in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral value many place on developing fetal life and the autonomy, health, and equal rights of pregnant people. A workable consensus is to ensure safe, legal access early in pregnancy and always when a pregnancy endangers a person\u2019s life or serious health, while allowing carefully limited regulation later that includes clear medical exceptions and avoids criminalizing patients or clinicians. At the same time, policy should reduce the need for abortion through affordable contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and parenting support, and assistance for families facing hardship.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral seriousness many attach to potential life and the fundamental health, autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people. A workable middle ground prioritizes preventing unwanted pregnancies through education and contraception, ensuring timely access to safe medical care\u2014especially in cases of rape, incest, severe fetal anomalies, or risks to the pregnant person\u2019s health\u2014and allowing thoughtful limits later in pregnancy that include clear medical exceptions. In shaping policy, governments should rely on medical evidence, protect privacy, and reduce hardship through social supports that help people carry pregnancies to term when they choose.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral concerns people hold about potential life and the need to protect the health, autonomy, and equality of those who are pregnant. A workable approach is to ensure access to timely, evidence-based medical care\u2014especially in cases involving serious health risks, rape or incest, or fetal conditions incompatible with life\u2014while allowing carefully limited regulation later in pregnancy that reflects medical realities and preserves clinician judgment. Across viewpoints, common ground includes reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and social supports that make parenting more feasible, so fewer people face this decision."
