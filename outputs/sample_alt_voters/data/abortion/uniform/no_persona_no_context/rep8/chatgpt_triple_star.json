    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for personal autonomy and privacy with a genuine interest in protecting developing life, while recognizing that people hold deeply different moral and religious views about when that protection should apply. A workable consensus can focus on ensuring access to accurate information, contraception, and robust prenatal and social supports, while allowing abortion in circumstances such as threats to health, severe fetal conditions, and cases of rape or incest, alongside carefully defined limits later in pregnancy. Policy should prioritize compassion, medical integrity, and reducing the conditions that lead to unwanted pregnancies rather than criminalizing patients or clinicians."
