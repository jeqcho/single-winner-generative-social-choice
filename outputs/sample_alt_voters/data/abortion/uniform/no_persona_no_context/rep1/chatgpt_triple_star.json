    "Laws on abortion should aim to protect both personal autonomy and the potential value of developing life, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral rights begin. A workable approach is to ensure early access to safe, legal care while allowing carefully limited, evidence-based protections as pregnancy progresses, with clear exceptions for threats to the patient\u2019s life or health, severe fetal conditions, and pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Across all stages, policy should prioritize reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust support for parents and children.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both personal autonomy and respect for developing life by grounding policy in medical evidence, compassion, and clearly defined limits tied to health and viability. They should guarantee timely access to safe care\u2014especially in cases of serious health risks, rape, incest, or severe fetal anomalies\u2014while also allowing room for conscientious moral disagreement without imposing undue burdens on patients. A balanced approach can pair legal protections with support for contraception, prenatal care, and social services that reduce unintended pregnancies and make carrying a pregnancy to term more feasible.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and individual circumstances, recognizing that sincere moral and religious convictions differ. A workable framework can protect access early in pregnancy and ensure exceptions at any stage for threats to life or serious health risks, rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies, while allowing increased regulation later in pregnancy when viability is more likely. Alongside legal standards, society should invest in contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and economic supports so that fewer people face unwanted or medically risky pregnancies in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s autonomy, health, and individual circumstances, recognizing that people hold sincere, differing beliefs about when moral status begins. A workable approach is to protect access to abortion at least in early pregnancy and to ensure clear exceptions later for threats to life or health, severe fetal conditions, and cases of rape or incest, while allowing reasonable regulation that does not create undue barriers. Policymakers should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and robust maternal healthcare.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both respect for developing human life and the health, autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people, recognizing that sincere moral convictions differ. A workable consensus is to prioritize preventing unintended pregnancies through education and access to contraception, while allowing abortion at least early in pregnancy and ensuring clear exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to a patient\u2019s life or health. Regulations should be based on sound medical evidence, safeguard privacy, and ensure timely access to care, while also supporting those who choose to carry pregnancies to term through robust prenatal, childbirth, and family supports."
