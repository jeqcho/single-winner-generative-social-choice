    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy and health, recognizing that people disagree deeply about when moral personhood begins. A workable approach protects access early in pregnancy and guarantees care when a pregnancy threatens life or serious health, while allowing increasing protections for fetal development later on, guided by medical evidence and due process. Whatever the legal framework, it should also reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through broad contraception access, accurate sex education, and strong support for parents and children."
