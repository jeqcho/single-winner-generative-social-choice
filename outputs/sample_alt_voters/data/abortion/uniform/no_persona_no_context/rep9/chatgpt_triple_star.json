    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral concerns many people have about potential life and the fundamental interests in bodily autonomy, health, and equal citizenship for those who are pregnant. A workable middle ground is to protect access to abortion early in pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, or incest, while allowing carefully limited, evidence-based regulations later in pregnancy that prioritize medical judgment and avoid undue burdens. Policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong supports for parents, so fewer people face this decision in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect individual autonomy while also acknowledging society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, grounding policy in medical evidence and compassion rather than ideology. A balanced approach can protect access to safe, legal care early in pregnancy, include reasonable limits later with clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health, and ensure decisions are made with informed consent and privacy. Common ground can also include reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and support for parents, so fewer people face crisis decisions in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for developing fetal life with protection of a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal participation in society. A workable consensus is to allow access early in pregnancy and to permit abortion later when there are serious risks to the patient\u2019s life or health, severe fetal conditions, or other compelling circumstances, while encouraging informed, voluntary decision-making without coercion. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and reliable maternal healthcare.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential human life with the rights, health, and personal autonomy of pregnant people, recognizing that reasonable people differ on when moral personhood begins. A workable consensus can protect access to safe, legal abortion at least in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, or incest, while allowing increasing protections for fetal life later in pregnancy with clear medical exceptions. Alongside legal rules, policymakers should reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and parenting support, and robust healthcare.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with the reality that pregnancy directly affects a person\u2019s health, autonomy, and family circumstances. A workable approach is to protect broad access early in pregnancy and to allow later restrictions that include clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and serious health risks, and for pregnancies involving severe fetal anomalies or violence. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and ensuring decisions are informed, private, and free from coercion."
