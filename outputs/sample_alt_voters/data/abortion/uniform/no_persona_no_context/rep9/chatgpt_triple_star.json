    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual bodily autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, while recognizing that people hold deeply sincere, differing moral beliefs about when that protection should begin. A workable approach is to ensure access to timely, safe medical care\u2014especially in early pregnancy and in cases of rape, incest, severe fetal anomaly, or serious risk to the pregnant person\u2019s health\u2014alongside reasonable, evidence-based safeguards that do not create undue burdens. At the same time, policy should invest in reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong support for parents, so fewer people face this decision in the first place."
