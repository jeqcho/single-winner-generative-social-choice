A broad middle ground is to keep early care legal and accessible, require that later restrictions be tied to medical viability and clinical realities, and guarantee prompt exceptions for threats to life or major health, rape or incest, and grave fetal anomalies. Alongside any limits, policy should invest heavily in contraception, accurate education, maternal healthcare, and practical supports for parenting and adoption, so fewer people face crisis pregnancies and fewer choices are made under duress.",

Common ground starts with reducing crisis pregnancies through evidence-based sex education, accessible contraception, strong maternal healthcare, and practical support for parenting and adoption.
