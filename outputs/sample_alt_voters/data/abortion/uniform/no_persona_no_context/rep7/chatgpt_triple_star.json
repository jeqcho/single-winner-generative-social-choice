    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for bodily autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting developing life, recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious differences on when personhood begins. A workable approach can protect access early in pregnancy while allowing proportionate regulations later, with clear exceptions for threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health, and for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, and supports for pregnant people, parents, and children."
