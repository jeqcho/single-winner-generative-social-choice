    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both personal autonomy and the value many people place on potential human life, recognizing that reasonable people disagree about where to draw ethical lines. A workable approach is to keep early pregnancy decisions primarily between a patient and clinician, while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy with clear exceptions for risks to the pregnant person\u2019s health, cases of severe fetal anomaly, and pregnancies from rape or incest. Policies should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding access to contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and economic supports for families, and ensure compassionate, nonjudgmental care for all involved.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect the moral seriousness of potential life while also protecting the health, bodily autonomy, and equal citizenship of pregnant people. A workable consensus is to permit abortion early in pregnancy, and later when there are serious risks to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health or when severe fetal anomalies are present, while reducing the need for abortion through contraception access, comprehensive sex education, and strong support for parents. Policy should be evidence-based, safeguard patient privacy and medical judgment, and allow room for conscience without blocking timely care.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 autonomy and health with society\u2019s interest in protecting developing human life, recognizing that people disagree deeply about when moral personhood begins. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to safe medical care early in pregnancy, allow later restrictions with clear exceptions for threats to life or serious health and for severe fetal conditions, and avoid criminalizing patients or clinicians acting in good faith. Alongside any legal framework, governments should invest in contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare supports, and unbiased counseling to reduce unintended pregnancies and make parenting a realistic choice.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant people\u2019s bodily autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting developing life, recognizing that people draw moral lines in different places. A practical middle ground is to safeguard access early in pregnancy while allowing increasing regulation later, with clear exceptions for threats to health or life, severe fetal anomalies, and cases like rape or incest. Policy should also focus on common goals\u2014preventing unintended pregnancies through education and contraception, providing prenatal and parenting support, and ensuring decisions are made with accurate medical information and without coercion.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with protection of the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal standing, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral and legal rights begin. A practical approach is to ensure timely access early in pregnancy, provide robust supports that make continuing a pregnancy more feasible, and set later-pregnancy limits with clear exceptions for threats to life or serious health, severe fetal conditions, and cases like rape or incest. Policy should also focus on shared goals\u2014reducing unintended pregnancies through education and contraception, improving maternal and child healthcare, and ensuring decisions are made safely and without coercion."
