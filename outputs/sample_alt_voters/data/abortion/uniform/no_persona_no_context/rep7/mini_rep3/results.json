A durable compromise pairs wide access to contraception and early prenatal care with timely, medically safe abortion services, and it sets any later-pregnancy limits around medical viability and serious threats to health, severe fetal conditions, or grave circumstances. The law should be clear enough for clinicians to act quickly in emergencies and should be matched with strong supports for parenting and adoption so decisions are less driven by poverty, coercion, or lack of care.",
