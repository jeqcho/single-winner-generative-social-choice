A durable middle ground is to guarantee timely, safe care with clear protections for medical emergencies and clinician judgment, while allowing democratically set limits that are transparent, consistently applied, and not punitive. To reduce abortions and hardship, policy should also invest in contraception access, prenatal and postpartum care, and economic supports for parents and adoption so fewer pregnancies become crises.",
