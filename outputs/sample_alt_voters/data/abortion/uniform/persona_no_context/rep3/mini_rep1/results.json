They can recognize the moral value many place on developing life by allowing access early in pregnancy, setting medically grounded limits later, and guaranteeing clear, workable exceptions when a pregnancy results from rape or incest, threatens health, or cannot result in a viable birth. Lasting common ground comes from reducing crisis pregnancies through contraception and evidence-based education, and from ensuring real support for parenting, prenatal and maternal care, adoption, and economic stability.",
