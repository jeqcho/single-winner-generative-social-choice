A workable framework protects safe, timely access to care with clear, medically grounded exceptions for threats to the patient\u2019s life or health and for the most serious circumstances, while avoiding shame, punishment, or political intrusion into the exam room. At the same time, policy should aim to reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and strong supports for parents, adoption, and childcare.
