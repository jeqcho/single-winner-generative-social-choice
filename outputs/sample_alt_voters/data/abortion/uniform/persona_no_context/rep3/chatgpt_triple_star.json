    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with respect for the autonomy, health, and equal citizenship of pregnant people, recognizing that reasonable people disagree about when moral and legal personhood begins. A workable framework can protect access to abortion early in pregnancy and ensure later procedures remain available when serious health risks, severe fetal conditions, or other compelling circumstances arise, alongside clear medical standards and due-process safeguards. At the same time, policy should reduce unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and support for parents and children, so fewer people face this decision in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and equal citizenship, while recognizing that people hold sincere, differing moral and religious views about when life should be protected. A workable middle ground is to ensure early access to safe, legal abortion, provide robust support for contraception, prenatal care, and parenting, and allow later-term restrictions with clear exceptions for serious health risks, rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies. Policymaking should be guided by medical evidence, compassion, and due process, aiming to reduce unintended pregnancies and harm rather than punish people in crisis.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both respect for potential human life and the health, autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people, recognizing that citizens differ deeply on when moral personhood begins. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to comprehensive medical care\u2014especially in cases of risk to the patient\u2019s life or serious health complications, rape, or incest\u2014while allowing democratically accountable limits later in pregnancy that include clear exceptions and do not interfere with clinicians\u2019 judgment. Alongside any legal framework, governments should invest in contraception, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and social supports that reduce unintended pregnancies and make parenting feasible, areas where broad agreement is possible.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for developing human life with respect for pregnant people\u2019s autonomy, health, and equal status, recognizing that reasonable people disagree about when and how moral rights apply. A workable consensus is to protect access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy, while allowing carefully limited regulations later that prioritize serious health risks, nonviable pregnancies, and severe fetal anomalies, and that do not impose undue burdens. At the same time, policy should reduce unintended pregnancies and the perceived need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong supports for parents and families, while safeguarding patient privacy and room for individual conscience within the bounds of timely care.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with protection of the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral personhood begins. A workable approach is to guarantee access early in pregnancy and in cases of rape, incest, or serious threats to health, while allowing carefully limited regulations later that are grounded in medical evidence and do not create undue barriers. Policy should also focus on shared goals\u2014reducing unintended pregnancies and supporting families\u2014through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and social supports."
