    "Laws concerning abortion should protect individual autonomy and dignity while recognizing the societal interest in supporting prenatal life and maternal health; this means reasonable limits timed to fetal development and exceptions for the life, health, or severe circumstances of the pregnant person, alongside robust access to contraception, comprehensive sex education, and health care that reduce unintended pregnancies. Policymaking should be guided by evidence, respect for deeply held moral diversity, and policies that minimize harm and expand support for families so that fewer people feel compelled to choose between their health, economic security, and their values."
