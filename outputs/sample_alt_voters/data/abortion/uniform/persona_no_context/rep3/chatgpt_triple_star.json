    "Laws on abortion should protect the health, autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people while recognizing society\u2019s interest in supporting potential life; this means ensuring access to safe, legal care alongside reasonable safeguards and supports that reduce the need for abortion, such as comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and maternal health services. Policymaking should be guided by medical evidence, respect for individual conscience, and attention to the complex circumstances that lead people to seek abortion, with legal limits narrowly tailored and accompanied by social supports that minimize harms for women, families, and children."
