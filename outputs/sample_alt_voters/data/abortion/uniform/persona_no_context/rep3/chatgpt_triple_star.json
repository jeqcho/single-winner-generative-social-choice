    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for developing human life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and capacity to make deeply personal decisions. A workable middle ground is to protect broad access early in pregnancy, allow later restrictions that reflect increasing fetal development, and always preserve clear exceptions for serious health risks, life endangerment, and pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Policy should also prioritize shared goals\u2014preventing unintended pregnancies, reducing the need for abortion, and supporting parents and children\u2014through contraception access, comprehensive sex education, and robust medical and social supports."
