    "Laws on abortion should aim to respect the moral seriousness of ending a potential life while protecting the health, safety, and autonomy of those who are pregnant. A balanced approach can combine evidence-based medical standards, compassionate support for parenting and adoption, and clear protections for access at least in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risks, rape, incest, or nonviable pregnancies. Where restrictions exist, they should be narrowly tailored, medically informed, and paired with robust contraception access, prenatal care, and social supports to reduce unintended pregnancies and hardship."
