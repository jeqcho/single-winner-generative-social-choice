    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life by ensuring safe, legal access to reproductive care while allowing reasonable, evidence-based limits that reflect medical consensus and public health concerns. Policy should prioritize reducing unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education and contraception access, support pregnant people and families with social services, and protect conscience-based providers, so that legal frameworks minimize harm, respect diverse moral views, and promote equitable outcomes."
