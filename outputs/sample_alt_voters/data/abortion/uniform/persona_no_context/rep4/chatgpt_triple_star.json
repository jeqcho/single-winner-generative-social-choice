    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s autonomy, health, and equal standing under the law. A workable middle ground is to protect broad access early in pregnancy and to allow later restrictions that include clear, enforceable exceptions for the life and serious health of the pregnant person, pregnancies from rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies, without imposing burdens that effectively block care. Policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through evidence-based sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postnatal support, and robust healthcare access.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential human life with the rights, health, and autonomy of pregnant people, and recognize that reasonable citizens differ on when moral personhood begins. A durable approach is to protect access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy while allowing carefully limited, evidence-based regulations later that include clear exceptions for threats to life or health, rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies. Policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, and support for parents, and ensure decisions are informed by medical expertise and privacy protections rather than stigma.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with the pregnant person\u2019s autonomy, health, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral and legal protections should begin. A workable approach is to keep abortion legal and accessible early in pregnancy, while allowing increasing state interest later, with clear exceptions for threats to life or serious health, pregnancies from rape or incest, and severe fetal conditions. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, maternal health care, and social supports that make it easier to carry a pregnancy to term if someone chooses.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant people\u2019s bodily autonomy with a serious regard for developing fetal life, recognizing that citizens disagree in good faith about when moral personhood begins. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy, allow reasonable health and safety regulations that do not create undue barriers, and restrict later abortions except when a pregnancy threatens the patient\u2019s life or health or involves severe fetal anomalies. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and maternal health care, and economic supports for families.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both personal bodily autonomy and respect for developing human life by grounding policy in widely shared values like compassion, dignity, and the reduction of harm. A reasonable framework can allow access\u2014especially early in pregnancy and in cases such as rape, incest, or serious risks to health\u2014while permitting carefully limited regulations later in pregnancy, aligned with medical evidence and the concept of viability. At the same time, governments should invest in measures that reduce unwanted pregnancies and make parenting truly supported, including comprehensive sex education, contraception access, prenatal care, and economic assistance."
