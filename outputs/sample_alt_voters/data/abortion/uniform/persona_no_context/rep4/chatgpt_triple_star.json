    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy and reproductive decision-making with protections for fetal health, guided by evidence-based medical standards and compassionate access to care. Policymaking should prioritize clear, equitable safeguards that ensure informed consent, timely medical support, and reasonable limits that reflect medical viability and public health considerations, while accommodating conscience rights and minimizing harm to women and families."
