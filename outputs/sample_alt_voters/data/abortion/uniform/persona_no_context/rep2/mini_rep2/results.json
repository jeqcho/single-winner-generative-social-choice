A durable framework keeps early care accessible and safe, sets transparent and medically workable standards for later pregnancies with enforceable exceptions for serious health risks, rape or incest, and profound fetal anomalies, and relies on clinical judgment instead of criminal penalties. It should also reduce the circumstances that lead to abortion by investing in contraception access, evidence-based education, maternal health care, and practical support for parents and adoption, so fewer families face the decision in crisis.",
