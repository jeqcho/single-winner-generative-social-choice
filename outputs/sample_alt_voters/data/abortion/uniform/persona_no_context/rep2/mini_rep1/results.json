A workable middle ground is to guarantee timely access early in pregnancy, set clear and medically defined standards for later-term care, and include explicit exceptions for life-threatening or serious health risks, rape or incest, and conditions incompatible with life. Whatever limits exist should be written plainly, avoid criminalizing patients or doctors acting in good faith, and be paired with real investments in contraception access, maternal health care, adoption options, and family supports so fewer people face this decision at all.",
