    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for individual bodily autonomy, while recognizing that people hold sincere, deeply held moral and religious differences about when personhood begins. A reasonable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy, permit later abortions when necessary to safeguard the pregnant person\u2019s life or serious health and in cases of severe fetal anomaly, and pair legal rules with prevention measures like comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust support for pregnant people and families. Policy should be grounded in medical evidence, privacy, and fairness, with decisions as close as possible to patients and clinicians rather than punitive enforcement.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a balanced commitment to protecting potential life while respecting the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship. A reasonable middle ground recognizes that people disagree about when moral personhood begins, but can still agree on preventing unwanted pregnancies, ensuring access to accurate information and contraception, and providing social supports that make parenting feasible. It should allow abortion at least in cases of serious health risk, rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies, while permitting democratically chosen limits later in pregnancy that include clear medical exceptions and avoid criminalizing patients or doctors.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious disagreements about when life gains full moral status. A workable consensus is to protect access early in pregnancy and to allow later restrictions that include clear, enforceable exceptions for threats to life or serious health, pregnancies from rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies, while ensuring decisions are guided by medical evidence rather than politics. At the same time, policy should reduce unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust support for parents, so fewer people face this choice in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential human life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy and health, while recognizing that people differ deeply on when moral personhood begins. A workable approach is to ensure timely access early in pregnancy and always protect care needed for life, serious health risks, or nonviable pregnancies, alongside reasonable limits later in pregnancy that include clear medical exceptions. Policies should also reduce the need for abortion through better contraception access, sex education, prenatal and postpartum support, and resources for parents, so fewer people face this decision in the first place.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with protection of a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal participation in society, while recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious disagreements about when personhood begins. A workable consensus can protect access early in pregnancy and ensure later abortions remain available when there are serious medical risks, severe fetal conditions, or compelling circumstances, paired with safeguards like informed consent, privacy, and high-quality medical standards. Alongside any legal framework, communities can reduce abortion rates by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and practical support for parenting and adoption."
