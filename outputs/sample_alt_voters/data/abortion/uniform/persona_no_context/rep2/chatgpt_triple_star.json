    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for pregnant people\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal participation in society. A durable approach can recognize differing moral convictions while aiming to reduce unwanted pregnancies through education, contraception access, and support for parents, and by ensuring safe, timely medical care when needed. Policy can allow abortion at least in early pregnancy and in cases involving serious health risks, rape, incest, or nonviable pregnancies, while permitting reasonable, evidence-based regulations that do not create undue barriers. Decisions should be guided by medical expertise, compassion, and a commitment to both individual rights and shared responsibility for the conditions that lead to pregnancy."
