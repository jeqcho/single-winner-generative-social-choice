    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy and health with protections for prenatal life by ensuring safe, legal access to abortion while allowing reasonable, evidence-based limits based on gestational age and maternal health. Policymaking should be guided by medical expertise, reliable data, and support services\u2014such as comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and maternal care\u2014to reduce unwanted pregnancies and ensure that decisions are made safely and compassionately for those affected."
