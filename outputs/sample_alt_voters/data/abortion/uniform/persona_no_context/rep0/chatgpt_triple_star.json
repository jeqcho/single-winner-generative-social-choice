    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy and the moral concerns many hold about prenatal life by protecting access to safe reproductive healthcare while allowing reasonable limits that reflect widely shared interests in maternal health, fetal viability, and informed consent. Policy should prioritize evidence-based medicine, equitable access, and support for families\u2014such as counseling, healthcare, and social services\u2014so that decisions are made safely and responsibly within a framework that seeks to minimize harm and accommodate deeply held ethical differences."
