    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for developing human life with respect for pregnant people\u2019s health, bodily autonomy, and ability to make informed decisions. A workable middle ground protects access to safe, legal care\u2014especially early in pregnancy and in cases of rape, incest, or serious health risks\u2014while allowing greater regulation later in pregnancy based on medical evidence and fetal viability. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal support, and resources for parents, and it should be shaped by science, privacy, and compassion rather than punishment.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, bodily autonomy, and life circumstances. A workable framework can protect access early in pregnancy, allow later restrictions that include clear exceptions for medical need and serious hardship, and ensure decisions are guided by medical expertise and patient privacy rather than politics. Alongside any legal limits, society should invest in contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and family supports so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and more can choose to carry safely.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s autonomy, health, and equal citizenship, recognizing that reasonable people differ deeply about when moral status begins. A workable consensus can protect access to early abortion and essential care in medical emergencies, while allowing increasing safeguards and responsibilities as pregnancy advances, grounded in medical evidence rather than ideology. Policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong supports for parents, so fewer people face this decision in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral value many place on developing fetal life and the rights, health, and autonomy of the pregnant person. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to safe medical care\u2014especially in cases involving threats to health, rape or incest, and serious fetal conditions\u2014while allowing carefully limited regulations later in pregnancy that protect potential life without imposing undue burdens. Policymaking should be guided by medical evidence, compassion, and fairness, alongside commitments to prevention through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and support for parents and families.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect the moral seriousness many people attach to fetal life while also protecting the health, dignity, and autonomy of those who are pregnant. A workable approach can permit abortion early in pregnancy, ensure access when a pregnancy threatens health or results from coercion, and allow increasing safeguards later in pregnancy with clear exceptions and medically grounded standards. Alongside legal rules, governments should invest in contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and parenting support, and adoption services so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and fewer feel abortion is their only option."
