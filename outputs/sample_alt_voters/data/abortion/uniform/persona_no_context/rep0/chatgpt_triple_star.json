    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individuals\u2019 bodily autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life by ensuring access is safe, compassionate, and time-sensitive while allowing reasonable limits informed by medical evidence. Policymaking should prioritize reducing unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education and contraception access, support for pregnant people and families, and careful consideration of gestational stages and serious health risks to guide permissible limits. Recognizing sincere moral disagreement, laws should minimize coercion and stigma and focus on practical measures that protect health, privacy, and the well-being of people and communities."
