    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral seriousness many attach to fetal life and the fundamental importance of a pregnant person\u2019s health, dignity, and autonomy. A workable middle ground is to protect access to safe, legal abortion at least in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy that include clear exceptions and do not criminalize patients or clinicians. Policy should also prioritize preventing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust support for parents, so fewer people face this decision in the first place."
