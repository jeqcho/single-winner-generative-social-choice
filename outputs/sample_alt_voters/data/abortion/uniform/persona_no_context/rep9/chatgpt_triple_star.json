    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for the potential value of fetal life with the autonomy, health, and dignity of the pregnant person, recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious differences on when life and rights begin. A practical middle ground is to protect access to abortion early in pregnancy and to ensure later-term abortions remain available when there are serious threats to health, severe fetal conditions, or other compelling circumstances, alongside robust medical standards. At the same time, society can reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and healthcare, while safeguarding privacy and avoiding punitive measures that endanger patients or clinicians.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for bodily autonomy with the moral concern many have for developing fetal life, aiming to reduce harm rather than impose a single worldview. A common-ground approach is to protect access early in pregnancy while allowing carefully limited, medically grounded restrictions later, with clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health, severe fetal anomalies, and cases such as rape or incest. Policy should also prioritize prevention and support\u2014accurate sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and economic assistance\u2014so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and no one is forced into unsafe situations.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy and health, recognizing that people disagree deeply about when moral personhood begins. A workable approach is to keep abortion legal and accessible early in pregnancy, while allowing increasing regulation later that includes clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health, severe fetal conditions, and circumstances like rape or incest. Whatever the legal framework, shared priorities should include reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education and contraception, and ensuring unbiased medical care, due process, and support for parents and children.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for developing fetal life with the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and ability to make decisions in complex personal circumstances. A workable consensus can protect access at least early in pregnancy and always in cases of serious health risk, rape, incest, or fatal fetal conditions, while allowing greater regulation as pregnancy advances based on medical evidence and viability. Policy should also reduce unwanted pregnancies and abortions by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal support, and social services, and by ensuring decisions are guided by patient-centered medical care rather than ideology.",
    "Laws on abortion should aim to respect both the moral value many place on potential life and the fundamental importance of bodily autonomy and health for those who are pregnant. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to safe medical care\u2014especially in cases involving serious health risks, rape or incest, or severe fetal anomalies\u2014while allowing democratically set, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy that include clear medical exceptions. Alongside legal standards, policymakers should reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust support for parents and children."
