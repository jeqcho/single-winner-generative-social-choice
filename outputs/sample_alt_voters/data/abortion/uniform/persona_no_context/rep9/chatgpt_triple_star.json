    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and ability to make deeply personal decisions. A workable middle ground is to protect broad access early in pregnancy, allow later restrictions that include clear exceptions for serious health risks, life-threatening conditions, and severe fetal anomalies, and ensure decisions are guided by medical evidence and patient privacy. Alongside any legal limits, society should invest in contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and economic supports that reduce unintended pregnancies and make carrying a pregnancy to term more feasible."
