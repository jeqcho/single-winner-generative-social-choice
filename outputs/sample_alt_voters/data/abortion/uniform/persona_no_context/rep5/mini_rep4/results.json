A durable middle ground sets clear, medically defined protections for emergencies and serious health threats, preserves meaningful decision-making between the patient and clinician early in pregnancy, and allows reasonable limits later with carefully written exceptions and due-process clarity for doctors. At the same time, policy should reduce crisis pregnancies by expanding contraception access, accurate sex education, prenatal and postpartum care, adoption support, and practical aid so families have real options.",
