    "Laws concerning abortion should protect the health, bodily autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people while recognizing society's legitimate interest in supporting fetal development through reasonable limits and safeguards. Policy should be grounded in medical evidence, ensure access to comprehensive reproductive health care and counseling, and provide support\u2014such as healthcare, parental leave, and social services\u2014to reduce the pressures that unduly constrain choice."
