    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s autonomy, health, and personal circumstances, recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious differences about when life begins. A workable approach is to protect access to safe, legal care early in pregnancy, ensure clear exceptions when the person\u2019s life or health is at risk and in cases like rape or incest, and allow carefully defined, medically guided limits later in pregnancy that reflect fetal development and viability. At the same time, policy should reduce the need for abortion through contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and practical supports for families, while safeguarding freedom of conscience for individuals and providers within patient-centered care.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with the rights, health, and autonomy of pregnant people, recognizing that sincere moral convictions differ on when and how fetal interests gain legal weight. A consensus approach can protect access to timely, safe care early in pregnancy, allow later limitations that include clear exceptions for health and life, and ensure decisions are made with accurate medical guidance rather than punishment. It should also reduce unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and support for parents and children, so fewer people face this choice in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and lived circumstances, recognizing that people hold sincere moral disagreements about when personhood begins. A workable approach protects access to timely, safe care\u2014especially in cases of health risks, rape or incest, and severe fetal conditions\u2014while allowing carefully limited, evidence-based regulations later in pregnancy that do not create undue burdens or medical delays. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal support, and social services so fewer people face crisis decisions.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential human life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral personhood begins. A workable approach is to protect access to early abortion and to ensure timely care when pregnancy poses serious risks, while allowing greater regulation later in pregnancy that remains narrowly tailored and always includes exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and serious health. Policy should also reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong supports for parents and children.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and ability to make deeply personal decisions. A workable middle ground protects access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy and ensures exceptions later when serious medical risks or severe fetal conditions are involved, while allowing reasonable, evidence-based regulations that do not create undue barriers. Policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and support for parents, so fewer people face this decision in the first place."
