    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential human life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and life circumstances, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral status begins. A practical consensus is to protect access early in pregnancy and to ensure later restrictions include clear, workable exceptions for serious health risks, fetal conditions incompatible with life, and cases of rape or incest. Policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through evidence-based sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and robust support for parents and children."
