    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral weight many people place on potential life and the fundamental rights, health, and autonomy of pregnant individuals. A balanced approach can protect access to safe, legal abortion at least in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, or incest, while allowing reasonable, evidence-based regulations later in pregnancy that prioritize medical judgment and minimize undue burdens. Across all views, common ground includes expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and parenting support, and non-coercive counseling so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and difficult decisions.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy and bodily integrity with a serious concern for developing human life, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral status begins. A workable approach is to protect broad access early in pregnancy, allow increasing safeguards as gestation progresses, and always preserve clear exceptions for threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or serious health, rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies. Policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, and support for parents and children, while ensuring decisions remain private, medically informed, and free from coercion.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and equal citizenship, acknowledging that people disagree deeply about when moral status begins. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy and to ensure clear, timely exceptions for threats to life or serious health, pregnancy from rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies, while setting carefully defined, medically informed limits later in pregnancy. Policy should prioritize evidence-based care, informed consent, privacy, and broader supports\u2014like contraception access, prenatal care, and economic assistance\u2014that reduce unintended pregnancies and make continuing a pregnancy more feasible.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 autonomy, health, and equal standing in society, recognizing that people hold sincere and divergent moral views about when and how rights develop. A workable consensus is to protect access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy, allow later restrictions that include clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life, serious health risks, and severe fetal conditions, and ensure decisions can be made promptly with qualified medical guidance. Alongside any legal framework, governments should reduce unintended pregnancies and the perceived need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and childcare support, and protections against coercion and discrimination.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both the dignity and health of pregnant people and the moral value many attach to developing life, recognizing that citizens differ deeply on when full moral status begins. A workable middle ground is to ensure timely access to comprehensive contraception, sex education, and prenatal support to reduce unintended pregnancies, while permitting abortion at least in early pregnancy and in cases of rape, incest, or serious threats to health, alongside reasonable, evidence-based regulations that do not create undue barriers. Policy should also invest in supports for parenting and adoption so that continuing a pregnancy is a realistic option, and it should be guided by medical expertise, respect for individual conscience, and transparency rather than punishment."
