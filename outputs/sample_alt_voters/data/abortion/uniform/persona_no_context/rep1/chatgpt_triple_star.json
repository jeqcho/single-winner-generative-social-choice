    "Laws on abortion should protect individual autonomy and bodily integrity while also recognizing society\u2019s interest in supporting potential life, balancing those concerns through clear, evidence-based limits and accessible supports. Policies should ensure safe, legal options and confidential medical care, while investing in comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and economic and parental support so that fewer people feel compelled to choose abortion for lack of alternatives. This approach respects deeply held moral views on both sides by minimizing harm, promoting informed choices, and supporting families and children."
