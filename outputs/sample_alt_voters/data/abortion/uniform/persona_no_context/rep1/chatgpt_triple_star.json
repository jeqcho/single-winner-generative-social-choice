    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for bodily autonomy and privacy with the widely held interest in protecting potential life, recognizing that people differ deeply on when moral status begins. A workable consensus is to keep abortion safe and legal early in pregnancy, paired with good-faith, evidence-based limits later that include clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health and for severe fetal conditions. Policy should also reduce unwanted pregnancies through accessible contraception, comprehensive sex education, and support for parents, while ensuring decisions are made with accurate medical information and without coercion."
