A consensus approach is to guarantee timely, evidence-based care and clear emergency exceptions, while setting any limits in plain, medically workable terms that avoid criminalizing patients or pressuring clinicians. At the same time, policy should reduce the situations that drive abortion by expanding contraception access, prenatal and maternal care, paid leave, and practical support for parenting or adoption, so fewer families face crisis decisions.",
