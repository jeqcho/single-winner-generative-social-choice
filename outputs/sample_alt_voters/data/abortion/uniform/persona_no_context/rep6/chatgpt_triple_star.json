    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s autonomy, health, and life circumstances, acknowledging that people disagree in good faith about when moral personhood begins. A workable approach is to protect access to early, safe abortion care while allowing carefully defined limits later in pregnancy that include clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health, severe fetal anomalies, and cases of rape or incest. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion through better contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and unbiased counseling, so fewer people face unwanted or medically risky pregnancies.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a balanced commitment to protecting potential life while safeguarding the health, autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people. A workable middle ground respects sincere moral disagreement by setting clear limits that align with medical evidence and public values, while ensuring timely access at least in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, incest, or fatal fetal conditions. Policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong supports for parents, so fewer people face this decision in the first place.",
    "Laws on abortion should aim to respect both the moral concerns many have about potential life and the need to protect the health, safety, and autonomy of pregnant people. A workable approach is to set medically informed, evidence-based rules that ensure timely access to care\u2014especially in cases of serious health risk, rape, incest, or fatal fetal conditions\u2014while encouraging prevention through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and support for parents. Decisions should be guided by medical expertise and compassion, with room for individual conscience rather than one-size-fits-all mandates.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and capacity to make moral decisions in complex circumstances. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy and ensure later-term decisions are guided by medical judgment, fetal viability, and serious health or life risks, while providing clear exceptions for rape, incest, and nonviable pregnancies. Across all viewpoints, policy should prioritize reducing unintended pregnancies through education and contraception, supporting families and prenatal care, and ensuring decisions are made safely, privately, and without coercion.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential human life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people hold sincere and deeply different moral beliefs about when personhood begins. A workable approach is to keep abortion broadly accessible early in pregnancy and to allow later restrictions that include clear exceptions for threats to life or serious health, severe fetal conditions, and circumstances such as rape or incest, while ensuring timely care. Policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through evidence-based sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and childcare support, and strong protections for patient privacy and medical decision-making."
