    "Laws concerning abortion should respect individual autonomy and the moral seriousness of ending a pregnancy by protecting persons\u2019 ability to make private medical decisions while also ensuring reasonable limits that protect public health, prevent coercion, and support pregnant people and families through access to healthcare, counseling, and economic resources. Policymaking should be evidence-based, minimize unnecessary barriers to care, and include safeguards for cases where maternal health is at risk, seeking to balance compassion, bodily integrity, and social responsibilities in a way that accommodates diverse ethical and religious convictions."
