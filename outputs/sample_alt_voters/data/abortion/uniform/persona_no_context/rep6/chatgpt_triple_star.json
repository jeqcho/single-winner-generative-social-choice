    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for bodily autonomy with a serious regard for developing fetal life, recognizing that people hold sincere, deeply held moral and religious views on both sides. A workable approach protects access to safe, legal care early in pregnancy while allowing carefully limited regulations later that include clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health, severe fetal anomalies, and cases of rape or incest. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, affordable prenatal and postnatal care, and economic supports for families. Any legal framework should be medically informed, protect privacy, and avoid criminalizing patients or clinicians acting in good-faith medical judgment."
