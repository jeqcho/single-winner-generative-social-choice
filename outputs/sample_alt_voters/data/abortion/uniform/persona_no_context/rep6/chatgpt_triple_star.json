    "Laws concerning abortion should protect individual autonomy and health care access while reflecting a commitment to reducing unwanted pregnancies and supporting pregnant people and families; this means ensuring safe, timely medical care, reasonable limits tied to gestational stages and medical necessity, and robust social supports like contraception, parental leave, and childcare. Policymaking should be guided by scientific evidence, respect for conscience, and measures that minimize harm\u2014seeking to reduce abortions through prevention and support rather than through punitive restrictions that endanger health."
