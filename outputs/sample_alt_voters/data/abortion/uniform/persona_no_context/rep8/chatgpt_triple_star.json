    "Laws governing abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy and bodily integrity with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life by ensuring safe, legal access early in pregnancy while permitting reasonable limits at later stages based on medical evidence. Policies ought to be informed by scientific evidence, public health considerations, and compassion, including access to contraception, comprehensive sex education, and support for pregnant people and families, so that people can make decisions with dignity while minimizing harm to all involved."
