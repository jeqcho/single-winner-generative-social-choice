    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 autonomy and health with society\u2019s interest in potential life, recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious differences about when that interest becomes decisive. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy and in cases involving serious health risks, rape or incest, or fatal fetal conditions, while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy that include clear exceptions and avoid criminalizing patients or clinicians. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and child support, and maternal healthcare so fewer people face unwanted or unsafe choices.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with protection of the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal standing under the law, recognizing that people hold sincere, conflicting beliefs about when moral personhood begins. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to safe, legal care in early pregnancy, allow later limits that include clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and serious health risks, and protect decisions in cases such as rape, incest, or severe fetal anomalies. Policymakers should pair any legal framework with broad support for contraception, comprehensive sex education, maternal healthcare, and social services so fewer people face unwanted or medically fraught pregnancies.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral seriousness many attach to fetal life and the fundamental importance of a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship. A workable approach protects access to timely, safe care\u2014especially in cases of risk to health, rape, incest, or severe fetal anomaly\u2014while allowing democratic limits later in pregnancy that include clear medical exceptions and preserve clinician judgment. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and social supports for parents, and it should be grounded in public health evidence, privacy, and compassion rather than punishment.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect personal autonomy and bodily integrity while also recognizing that many people place moral value on potential human life. A practical middle ground is to protect access to abortion early in pregnancy, allow carefully defined and medically guided limits later with clear exceptions for threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health, severe fetal anomalies, and cases of rape or incest. Policymakers should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and ensuring decisions are made privately between patients and qualified clinicians rather than through punitive measures.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s autonomy, health, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people hold sincere, deeply rooted moral views on both sides. A workable middle ground is to ensure safe, legal access at least in early pregnancy and always when the pregnancy results from rape or incest or when the person\u2019s life or serious health is at risk, while allowing carefully limited regulations later in pregnancy that prioritize medical judgment and fetal viability. At the same time, policy should reduce the need for abortion through better contraception access, comprehensive sex education, maternal healthcare, and economic supports for families."
