    "Laws concerning abortion should protect individual health, safety, and meaningful access to reproductive care while recognizing deeply held moral concerns about fetal life; policymakers should therefore base regulations on medical evidence, respect for personal conscience, and reasonable limits that prioritize the well\u2011being and autonomy of pregnant people. Where restrictions are considered, they should be narrowly tailored, include clear exceptions for preserving life and health, and be accompanied by supportive services \u2014 such as access to prenatal care, contraception, and counseling \u2014 so that people have real, compassionate options regardless of their circumstances."
