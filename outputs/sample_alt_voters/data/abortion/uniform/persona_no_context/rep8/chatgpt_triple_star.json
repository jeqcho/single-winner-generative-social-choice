    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, aiming to reduce harm and uphold human dignity. A workable middle ground is to protect access early in pregnancy while allowing carefully defined limits later, paired with clear exceptions for risks to the patient\u2019s life or serious health, pregnancy from rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies. Regardless of one\u2019s moral view, broad agreement can support preventing unwanted pregnancies through evidence-based sex education and contraception, and ensuring accessible prenatal, maternal health, and social supports so fewer people face this decision under pressure."
