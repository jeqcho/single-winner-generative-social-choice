A workable compromise provides timely access early in pregnancy, sets carefully defined standards later on with real flexibility for serious health risks and extreme circumstances, and avoids criminal penalties that deter emergency care. Alongside any legal framework, public policy should lower the number of abortions by expanding contraception, accurate education, prenatal and mental-health care, and practical support for parenting and adoption.",
