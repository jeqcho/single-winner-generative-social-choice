Whatever the legal limits, communities should invest in prevention and support\u2014contraception, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, mental-health services, paid leave, childcare, and adoption resources\u2014so fewer families face crisis pregnancies and fewer people feel cornered into impossible choices.",
