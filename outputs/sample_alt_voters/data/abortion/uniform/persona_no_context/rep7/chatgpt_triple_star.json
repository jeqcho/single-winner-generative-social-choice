    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy and bodily integrity with the societal interest in protecting potential life by ensuring access to safe, legal care while permitting reasonable, evidence-based limits that reflect compelling state interests. Policy should prioritize reducing unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education and contraception, ensure equitable access to healthcare, and include clear, narrowly drawn exceptions and supports for people and families facing difficult circumstances to minimize harm and preserve moral pluralism."
