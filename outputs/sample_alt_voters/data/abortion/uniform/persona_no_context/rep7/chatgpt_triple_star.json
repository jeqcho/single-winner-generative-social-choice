    "Laws concerning abortion should protect the health, autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people while recognizing society\u2019s interest in supporting potential life; they should therefore ensure access to safe, timely reproductive care alongside strong social supports\u2014such as healthcare, childcare, and economic assistance\u2014that reduce coercion and make parenting a viable choice. Policy should be informed by medical evidence, respect for individual conscience, and reasonable limits set through democratic processes that preserve exceptions for health and life, balancing personal liberty with communal responsibilities."
