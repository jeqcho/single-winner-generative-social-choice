    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both respect for potential life and the fundamental health, autonomy, and safety of pregnant people, recognizing that citizens hold sincere and differing moral views. A reasonable middle ground is to allow early access with informed consent and strong medical privacy, while permitting increasing regulation later in pregnancy tied to fetal viability, with clear exceptions for threats to the patient\u2019s life or health, rape or incest, and severe fetal conditions. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and child support, and affordable healthcare so fewer people face this decision in crisis."
