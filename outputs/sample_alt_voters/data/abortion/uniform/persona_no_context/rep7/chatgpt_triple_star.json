    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential human life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy and health, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral rights begin. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy and ensure clear exceptions later when serious threats to health or life, severe fetal anomalies, or pregnancy from rape or incest are involved, while also setting reasonable medical standards and preventing coercion. At the same time, society should reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and healthcare access so fewer people face unwanted or unsafe pregnancies.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for pregnant people\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, recognizing that sincere moral and religious convictions differ. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy, guarantee clear exceptions at any stage for the pregnant person\u2019s life and serious health risks, and allow greater regulation later in pregnancy based on fetal viability while ensuring timely care. Alongside legal rules, policy should reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, prenatal and postpartum support, and economic protections for families.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for the potential value of fetal life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal participation in society. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to safe, legal care early in pregnancy while allowing reasonable, medically grounded limits later on that include clear exceptions for risks to life or health, severe fetal anomalies, and circumstances such as rape or incest. Across all viewpoints, policy should prioritize reducing unintended pregnancies through evidence-based sex education, contraception access, and social supports that make parenting more feasible, while keeping decisions anchored in medical expertise and individual circumstances.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for developing human life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s health, bodily autonomy, and life circumstances, while recognizing that citizens hold sincere moral and religious disagreements about when personhood begins. A workable consensus is to protect access early in pregnancy and to guarantee exceptions later when there are serious health risks, fatal fetal conditions, or pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, alongside robust medical oversight. At the same time, policy should reduce the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and parenting support, and adoption resources, and ensure decisions are made safely and privately between patients and qualified clinicians.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people hold sincere, deeply different moral and religious views. A practical middle ground is to keep abortion legal and accessible early in pregnancy, ensure clear exceptions later for threats to life or serious health risks and for cases like severe fetal anomalies, and pair any limits with strong supports such as contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and family assistance. Policies should be evidence-based, medically guided, and crafted to reduce unwanted pregnancies and hardship while avoiding criminalization of patients and clinicians."
