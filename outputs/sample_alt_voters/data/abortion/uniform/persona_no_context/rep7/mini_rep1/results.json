Policy should ensure timely, safe care with clear, workable exceptions for medical emergencies and serious health risks, and it should not criminalize patients or clinicians acting in good faith. At the same time, communities can reduce abortions and support families by expanding access to contraception and accurate education, strengthening prenatal and postpartum care, and improving practical supports such as childcare, adoption services, and economic help so fewer people face crisis decisions.",
