    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for pregnant people\u2019s health and autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, recognizing that sincere moral and religious views differ on when that protection should begin. A consensus approach would prioritize preventing unintended pregnancies, ensuring accurate information and access to healthcare, and setting clear, medically grounded standards that protect a patient\u2019s life and health while allowing for increasing state interest as pregnancy progresses. Policymaking should be guided by evidence, compassion, and due process, aiming to reduce harm and support families regardless of the choices they face.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential human life with respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 health, autonomy, and equal participation in society. A workable middle ground is to protect access to abortion early in pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, incest, or nonviable pregnancies, while allowing carefully tailored regulations later in pregnancy that prioritize medical judgment and do not create undue barriers. Policy should also invest in prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and economic and family resources\u2014so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and fewer feel forced into any decision.",
    "Laws on abortion should aim to protect and support both pregnant individuals and developing life by prioritizing health, dignity, and careful ethical consideration. While people differ on when moral personhood begins, many can agree that policy should reduce unwanted pregnancies through education and contraception, ensure access to timely prenatal and maternal healthcare, and include clear exceptions for threats to the patient\u2019s life or serious health risks. Regulations, where applied, should be evidence-based, consistent, and designed to minimize harm, while respecting freedom of conscience and the diverse moral convictions in society.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect personal autonomy while also recognizing society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, especially as pregnancy progresses. A balanced approach can preserve access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy, with increasing safeguards later on, while ensuring clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health, severe fetal conditions, and cases of rape or incest. Regardless of where people stand morally, there is broad common ground in reducing unintended pregnancies through education and contraception, and in supporting parents and children with healthcare, childcare, and economic assistance.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 bodily autonomy and health with sincere concerns about protecting potential life, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral status begins. A workable approach is to ensure safe, legal access at least early in pregnancy and in cases of rape, incest, or serious threats to the patient\u2019s life or health, while allowing carefully defined, medically informed limits later in pregnancy with clear exceptions. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal support, and resources for parents and adoption, and it should protect clinicians and patients from criminalization for following evidence-based care."
