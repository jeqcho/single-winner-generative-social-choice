    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect human dignity and wellbeing by respecting that people hold deeply different moral views about fetal life and bodily autonomy. A balanced approach can prioritize preventing unintended pregnancies, ensuring timely access to accurate information and healthcare, and setting clear, medically grounded standards for later pregnancy that include meaningful exceptions for serious health risks and cases of rape or incest. Whatever the legal framework, it should support parents and children through healthcare, economic assistance, and social services so that fewer people feel forced into crisis decisions."
