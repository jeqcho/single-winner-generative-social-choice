It should include clear, compassionate exceptions for threats to life or serious health, rape or incest, and fatal fetal anomalies, and avoid criminalizing patients or providers acting in good faith.

Any limits should be evidence\u2011based, consistent, and enforced through health regulation\u2014not criminal penalties for patients or doctors\u2014so care is safe and predictable.
