    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s autonomy, health, and life circumstances, recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious differences about when personhood begins. A broadly acceptable approach is to keep abortion safe and legally accessible early in pregnancy, while allowing increasing protections for fetal development later, with clear exceptions for threats to the patient\u2019s life or serious health risks, pregnancies from rape or incest, and lethal fetal anomalies. Policy should also prioritize shared goals\u2014reducing unintended pregnancies and the number of abortions\u2014through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and practical support for parents.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for developing fetal life with the pregnant person\u2019s autonomy, health, and life circumstances, recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious differences about when moral status begins. A workable approach is to protect access to safe, legal abortion at least early in pregnancy and to guarantee clear exceptions later for threats to health or life, severe fetal anomalies, and pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, while allowing reasonable regulations that do not create undue burdens. Across all viewpoints, policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong medical and social supports for those who choose to continue a pregnancy.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral concerns about potential life and the bodily autonomy, health, and life circumstances of pregnant people, grounding policy in compassion and evidence. A workable middle ground protects access early in pregnancy, allows later limits with clear exceptions for serious threats to health or life and for pregnancies that are nonviable or result from abuse, and ensures decisions are made with qualified medical guidance rather than political interference. Alongside any legal framework, society should reduce unwanted pregnancies and support families through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and maternal care, and practical economic supports.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal standing under the law. A workable consensus can protect access early in pregnancy, allow later restrictions that track medical viability, and preserve clear exceptions for serious health risks, rape or incest, and fatal fetal conditions. Across all views, policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies and the pressures that lead to abortion by expanding contraception, accurate sex education, prenatal care, and practical support for parents and families.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant people\u2019s bodily autonomy with the widely held interest in protecting developing life, recognizing that people differ deeply on when moral status begins. A workable approach is to keep early pregnancy access safe and legal, while allowing carefully defined regulations later in pregnancy that prioritize medical judgment and provide clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and serious health risks, as well as for severe fetal anomalies. Policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortions through contraception access, comprehensive sex education, and social supports for parenting, while ensuring decisions remain private and free from stigma."
