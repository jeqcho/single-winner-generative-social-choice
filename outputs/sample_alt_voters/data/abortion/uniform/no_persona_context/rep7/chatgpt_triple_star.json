    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect personal autonomy while also recognizing society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, especially as pregnancy progresses. A balanced approach can preserve timely access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy, alongside evidence-based safeguards, informed consent, and meaningful support for people who want to carry pregnancies to term. Policy should also ensure clear exceptions to protect a patient\u2019s life and health and address rape or incest, while reducing the need for abortion through contraception access, comprehensive sex education, and economic and healthcare supports for families."
