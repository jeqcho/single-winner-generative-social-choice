It should guarantee timely access at least early in pregnancy and make nonnegotiable, clearly written protections for emergencies and serious health threats, while allowing later-pregnancy regulations that track medical realities like viability and do not override clinical judgment. To reduce abortions without coercion, any legal framework should be paired with broad access to contraception, accurate education, and strong supports for pregnancy, birth, and parenting or adoption.",
