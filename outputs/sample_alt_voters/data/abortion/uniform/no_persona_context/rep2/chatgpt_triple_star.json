    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect individual bodily autonomy while also recognizing that many people place moral value on developing fetal life. A workable middle ground is to ensure timely, safe access early in pregnancy, with increasing protections and careful limits later on, alongside clear exceptions for threats to the pregnant person\u2019s health, severe fetal anomalies, and cases of rape or incest. Policy should also prioritize preventing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust support for parents and children so fewer people face this decision."
