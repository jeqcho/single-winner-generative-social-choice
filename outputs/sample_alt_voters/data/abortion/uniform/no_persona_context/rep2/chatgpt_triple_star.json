    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and family circumstances. A workable middle ground is to protect broad access early in pregnancy, allow later restrictions that include clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health, and ensure timely care in cases such as rape, incest, or severe fetal anomalies. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by supporting contraception access, accurate sex education, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and practical supports for parents, while safeguarding privacy and leaving room for individual moral and religious convictions.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both personal autonomy and the value many people place on potential human life, recognizing that reasonable people disagree about when moral status begins. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy, paired with carefully limited regulation later in pregnancy that allows exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health, serious fetal conditions, and cases like rape or incest. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and economic supports for families, while safeguarding privacy and respecting freedom of conscience.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with the protection of a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal standing in society. A workable approach is to allow broad access early in pregnancy, paired with clear, medically grounded limits later that include exceptions for serious risks to health, fatal fetal conditions, and circumstances like rape or incest, with decisions guided by clinicians rather than politicians. Across this framework, governments should reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and social supports for parents, while keeping access safe and equitable.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by respect for human dignity, balancing a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy and health with the moral concerns many hold about developing fetal life. A broadly shared approach is to protect access to safe, legal care\u2014especially early in pregnancy and when health or severe hardship is at stake\u2014while allowing carefully defined limits later in pregnancy with clear exceptions for medical necessity and serious fetal conditions. Policy should prioritize reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong supports for parents, alongside transparent medical standards and due process that keep decisions primarily between patients and qualified clinicians.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral concerns many hold about fetal life and the widely shared belief that pregnant people deserve autonomy, safety, and compassionate care. A workable approach is to keep abortion legal and accessible early in pregnancy, allow later limits that reflect increasing fetal development, and include clear exceptions for threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health, severe fetal anomalies, and cases of rape or incest. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion through evidence-based measures like comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal support, and economic assistance for families."
