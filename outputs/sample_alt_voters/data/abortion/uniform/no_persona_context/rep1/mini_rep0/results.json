The law should guarantee prompt, confidential care early in pregnancy and always permit treatment when pregnancy endangers life or serious health, with decisions guided by licensed clinicians under clear, objective medical definitions rather than vague criminal penalties. As pregnancy advances, any limits should be transparent, workable in emergency care, and include explicit exceptions for rape, incest, and lethal or profoundly life-limiting fetal conditions. Lasting common ground comes from reducing coercion and crisis through contraception access, medically accurate education, and strong economic and healthcare supports for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption.",
