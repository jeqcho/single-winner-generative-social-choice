    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both respect for potential life and the health, autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people, recognizing that citizens hold sincere moral and religious differences about when life begins. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to safe medical care\u2014especially in emergencies and in cases like rape or severe fetal anomaly\u2014while allowing reasonable, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy that include clear exceptions and do not create barriers to medically necessary treatment. Policy should also reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong support for parents and children.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the pregnant person\u2019s autonomy and the moral concern many people hold for developing human life. A workable consensus is to protect access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based limits later, with clear exceptions for threats to health or life, severe fetal conditions, and circumstances like rape or incest. Policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies by expanding contraception, accurate sex education, prenatal support, and resources for parents, and it should ensure decisions are made with medical guidance rather than political interference.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should seek to respect both the moral seriousness many people attach to potential human life and the fundamental importance of a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship. A reasonable framework protects access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy, includes clear exceptions for threats to the patient\u2019s life or serious health, and allows for carefully defined limits later in pregnancy tied to medical viability and clinical judgment. Alongside legal rules, policy should reduce unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust support for parents and children, so fewer people face this decision in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for fetal life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, aiming to reduce harm and protect dignity for all involved. A consensus approach can protect access early in pregnancy, allow later restrictions with clear exceptions for rape or incest and for serious threats to health or life, and ensure decisions are guided by medical expertise rather than politics. It should also invest in preventing unwanted pregnancies and supporting families through contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and social supports so fewer people face this decision.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for developing human life with the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal standing under the law. A workable middle ground is to protect broad access early in pregnancy and ensure timely exceptions later when there are serious risks to the patient\u2019s life or health, severe fetal conditions, or pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, while also promoting fewer unwanted pregnancies through education, contraception, and social supports. Clear, medically grounded standards and safeguards should be set with input from doctors, ethicists, and affected communities so decisions are safe, consistent, and as free from political interference as possible."
