A sound approach keeps early abortion legal and accessible, ensures fast, unambiguous exceptions for life endangerment, serious health risk, rape or incest, and nonviable or fatal fetal conditions, and sets any later restrictions around viability and individualized medical judgment rather than rigid criminal penalties. To reduce abortions and hardship without coercion, policy should also expand contraception and accurate education, strengthen prenatal and postpartum care, and provide real financial and caregiving support for families and adoption.",
