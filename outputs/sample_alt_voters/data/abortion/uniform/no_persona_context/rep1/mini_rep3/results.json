It should protect timely access to care in early pregnancy and guarantee clinicians clear authority to act when a pregnancy threatens life or health, involves rape or incest, or is nonviable, while allowing carefully defined, medically grounded regulation later in pregnancy. Alongside any legal framework, governments should expand contraception, accurate sex education, prenatal and mental healthcare, childcare, and economic supports so fewer pregnancies become crises and fewer people feel forced into this decision.",

Any legal limits should be clear, workable in practice, and paired with narrowly defined exceptions for serious risks to health, rape or incest, and nonviable or catastrophic fetal conditions so clinicians can act without fear.
