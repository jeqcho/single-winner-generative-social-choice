The rules should be simple and medically workable: safeguard confidential early access, prohibit prosecution of patients, and guarantee prompt care for miscarriages and for any serious threat to health or life, with defined provisions for pregnancies resulting from sexual violence. Any limits later in pregnancy should track viability and objective clinical criteria, relying on physician judgment and review mechanisms rather than blanket bans. Lasting common ground also requires lowering the need for abortion through contraception, accurate education, and strong financial, childcare, prenatal, and postpartum supports.",

The law should keep time-sensitive medical decisions in the hands of patients and licensed clinicians, with clear, medically defined protections for emergencies and serious health risks and for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, and any later-pregnancy rules should be precise, evidence-based, and not enforced through criminalizing patients. The strongest common ground is reducing crisis pregnancies and coercion by expanding access to contraception and accurate education, alongside real supports for prenatal and postpartum care, paid leave, childcare, and adoption services so more families can choose parenting without hardship.",
