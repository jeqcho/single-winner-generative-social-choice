    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect the moral seriousness of ending a potential life while also protecting the health, autonomy, and equal citizenship of pregnant people. A workable approach is to prioritize preventing unintended pregnancies and supporting parents, while allowing abortion access early in pregnancy and ensuring clear exceptions for rape, incest, severe fetal anomalies, and threats to a patient\u2019s life or long-term health. As pregnancy progresses, regulation can increase, but it should be grounded in medical evidence, allow clinician judgment, and avoid punitive measures that endanger care or criminalize patients."
