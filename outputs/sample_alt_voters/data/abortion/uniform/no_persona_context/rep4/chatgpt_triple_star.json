    "Laws on abortion should aim to protect both personal autonomy and respect for developing human life by focusing on reducing harm and supporting informed, voluntary decisions. A workable consensus is to keep abortion legal and accessible early in pregnancy, with increasing safeguards and medical oversight as fetal development advances, while preserving clear exceptions when the pregnant person\u2019s life or health is at risk or in cases like rape or incest. At the same time, policy should expand contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and adoption resources so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and no one is coerced by lack of options.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both respect for potential life and the bodily autonomy, health, and dignity of pregnant people, recognizing that sincere moral convictions differ. A reasonable approach is to keep abortion legal and accessible early in pregnancy, allow increasing regulation later based on medical evidence of fetal development, and always preserve clear exceptions for serious health risks, rape or incest, and fatal fetal conditions. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and supports for parents.",
    "Laws on abortion should aim to protect both personal bodily autonomy and the state\u2019s interest in potential life, recognizing that people differ deeply on when and how moral status develops. A workable approach is to keep abortion broadly accessible early in pregnancy, while allowing increasing regulation later with clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and serious health risks, and in cases like severe fetal anomalies. Policy should also reduce the circumstances that lead to unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal support, and social services, so fewer people feel forced into impossible choices.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral seriousness many attach to fetal life and the autonomy, health, and life circumstances of pregnant people. A workable middle ground is to ensure access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy, with later-term restrictions that include clear exceptions for serious health risks, nonviable pregnancies, and cases such as rape or incest, and that protect medical judgment. Alongside any limits, policy should reduce unwanted pregnancies and support families through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and social supports, so fewer people face this decision in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect individual autonomy and bodily integrity while also recognizing that many people attribute moral significance to developing fetal life. A workable middle ground is to ensure timely access to abortion early in pregnancy, paired with increasing protections later in pregnancy that allow exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s health and life, severe fetal conditions, and cases like rape or incest. Policy should prioritize reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust prenatal and social supports, so fewer people face this decision in the first place."
