They should also reflect the moral concern many hold for developing life by encouraging early prenatal care and allowing measured limits later in pregnancy, while guaranteeing timely exceptions for serious health threats and cases of rape, incest, or nonviable pregnancies. To reduce both unintended pregnancies and the pressures that drive crisis decisions, policy should expand contraception access, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum care, adoption options, and practical supports like childcare and economic assistance, while avoiding punitive criminalization that endangers patients and providers.",
