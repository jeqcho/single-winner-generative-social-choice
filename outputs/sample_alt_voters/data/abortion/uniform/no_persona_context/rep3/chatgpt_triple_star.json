    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral seriousness many attach to potential life and the fundamental importance of a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and dignity. A workable middle ground is to protect access early in pregnancy, ensure clear exceptions for threats to health and life, and allow carefully limited regulation later in pregnancy that is grounded in medical evidence rather than politics. Policy should also reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and robust support for parents and children.",
    "Laws on abortion should aim to respect both the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy and the widely held interest in protecting developing life, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral and legal duties begin. A workable middle ground is to keep abortion broadly accessible early in pregnancy, while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based regulations later that prioritize maternal health and viability, with clear exceptions for medical emergencies, rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies. Policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortions through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and parenting support, and strong safeguards for patient privacy and medical decision-making.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect pregnant people\u2019s autonomy while also recognizing sincere concern for developing fetal life, especially as pregnancy progresses. A workable middle ground is to guarantee access early in pregnancy and in cases of rape, incest, or serious threats to a patient\u2019s health, while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy with clear medical exceptions. Policy should also reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postnatal support, and protections that ensure decisions are made safely and without coercion.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both personal liberty and respect for developing human life by grounding policy in medical evidence, constitutional rights, and compassion for complex real-world circumstances. A workable middle ground is to ensure timely access to abortion early in pregnancy, paired with increasing protections later in pregnancy while preserving clear exceptions when the pregnant person\u2019s life or health is at risk and in cases of severe fetal anomalies. Across all views, common priorities include preventing unintended pregnancies through education and contraception, ensuring informed consent and patient privacy, and providing practical supports for parents and families so fewer people face abortion out of hardship.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and lived circumstances, while recognizing that people hold sincere, differing moral convictions about when and how rights develop. A workable approach is to protect access at least in early pregnancy and to guarantee clear exceptions at later stages for serious health risks, rape or incest, and severe fetal conditions, with any limits grounded in medical evidence rather than politics. Alongside legal standards, society should reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and practical supports for parents."
