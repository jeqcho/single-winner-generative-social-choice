    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal standing under the law, recognizing that people hold sincere, differing moral and religious views about when life deserves legal protection. A workable consensus is to protect access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, incest, or severe fetal anomaly, while allowing greater regulation later in pregnancy so long as it does not endanger patients or create undue barriers. Policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong supports for parents, alongside clear medical guidelines and privacy protections."
