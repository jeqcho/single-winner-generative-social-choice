A durable framework uses medically grounded definitions, guarantees immediate care for emergencies and serious health threats, and provides clear, limited pathways in cases like sexual violence or fatal fetal conditions, with transparent rules that become more restrictive later without substituting politics for medical judgment. Whatever boundaries are chosen, common ground is strengthened by investing in contraception, accurate education, prenatal and postpartum healthcare, and practical supports like paid leave, childcare, and adoption services so fewer pregnancies become crises.",
