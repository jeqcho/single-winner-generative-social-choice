    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s autonomy, health, and life circumstances, recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious disagreements about when personhood begins. A workable approach is to ensure safe, legal access early in pregnancy and to allow later abortions when serious medical risks, severe fetal anomalies, or other compelling hardships are present, with decisions guided by medical expertise and the patient\u2019s informed consent rather than politics. At the same time, policies should reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and social supports for parenting."
