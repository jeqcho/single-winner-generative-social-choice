    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for bodily autonomy and privacy with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, while recognizing that people hold sincere, deeply rooted moral and religious views on both sides. A workable approach is to preserve meaningful access to abortion early in pregnancy and ensure timely exceptions later for serious health risks, fatal fetal conditions, and circumstances like rape or incest, alongside strong safeguards for informed consent and patient safety. Policies should also reduce unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and support for prenatal care, parenting, and adoption so fewer people face this decision.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s health, dignity, and ability to make deeply personal decisions, while recognizing that citizens hold sincere moral and religious differences about when personhood begins. A workable consensus can protect access at least in early pregnancy and guarantee exceptions for rape, incest, severe fetal anomalies, and threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or serious health, alongside reasonable, medically grounded regulations later in pregnancy. At the same time, policy should expand contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and parenting support, and adoption services to reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion without coercion.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both personal autonomy and the value many place on developing human life by focusing on practical, humane safeguards rather than absolutist outcomes. A reasonable approach is to ensure timely access to abortion early in pregnancy while allowing proportionate restrictions later that include clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health, severe fetal conditions, and cases of rape or incest. Policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies and abortions through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust prenatal and social supports, so fewer people face this decision in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal standing under the law. A workable middle ground protects access early in pregnancy, allows later restrictions that include clear, practical exceptions for threats to life or health, rape or incest, and severe fetal conditions, and ensures timely care without fear of prosecution. It should also emphasize reducing unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong supports for prenatal care, childbirth, and parenting so fewer people feel forced into any outcome.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, aiming to reduce harm and protect health. A workable approach is to ensure access to safe, timely care\u2014especially in cases involving serious health risks, rape or incest, or fatal fetal conditions\u2014while allowing reasonable, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy that include clear medical exceptions. Policy should also invest in prevention and support, such as comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and resources for parenting and adoption, so fewer people face unwanted or medically dangerous pregnancies."
