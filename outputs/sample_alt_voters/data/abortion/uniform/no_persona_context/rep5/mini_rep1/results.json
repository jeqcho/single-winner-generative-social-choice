The law should be clear enough that clinicians can act immediately in emergencies and should never criminalize patients or providers acting in good faith, with explicit protections for life- or serious health-threatening conditions, nonviable pregnancies, and cases of rape or incest. Any limits should be tied to evidence-based medical milestones and written with clinician input so they are workable in real care settings. Common ground is strengthened by reducing crisis pregnancies through access to contraception and accurate education, and by supporting families with prenatal/postpartum care, paid leave, childcare, and adoption and parenting resources.",
