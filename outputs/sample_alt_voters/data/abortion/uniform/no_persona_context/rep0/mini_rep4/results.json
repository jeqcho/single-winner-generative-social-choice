A workable approach protects timely care early in pregnancy, sets clear and enforceable standards for later stages, and guarantees explicit exceptions for life-threatening emergencies, serious health risks, rape, incest, and nonviable pregnancies. Alongside any legal framework, communities should reduce crisis pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and practical supports for parents so fewer people face desperate choices and policy focuses on compassion rather than punishment.",
