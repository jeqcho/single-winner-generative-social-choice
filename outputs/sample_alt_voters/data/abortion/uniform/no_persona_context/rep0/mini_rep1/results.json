That points to keeping early care accessible and private, writing any later limits in plain, medically precise terms with broad, workable exceptions (including life and serious health risks, lethal fetal conditions, and pregnancies from rape or incest), and avoiding criminal penalties that deter urgent treatment. The most unifying approach also commits to prevention and real support\u2014affordable contraception, accurate education, maternal healthcare, paid leave, childcare, and adoption services\u2014so fewer pregnancies become crises in the first place.",
