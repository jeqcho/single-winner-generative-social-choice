A consensus approach secures confidential, timely care and keeps clinical decisions with patients and qualified clinicians, with explicit, workable protections for emergencies and serious health threats and no criminal penalties for patients. If limits are set later in pregnancy, they should be narrowly defined, medically informed, and paired with strong due-process and clear guidance so care isn\u2019t delayed.
