    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for pregnant people\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, recognizing that communities hold sincere, conflicting moral views about when life gains full moral status. A workable approach is to protect access to abortion at least in early pregnancy and to safeguard clear exceptions later when a pregnancy threatens life or serious health, involves rape or incest, or reflects severe fetal anomalies, while allowing proportionate regulations aimed at safety rather than punishment. Policy should also reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through broad access to contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and parenting support, and robust maternal health care.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people differ in their moral and religious beliefs about when moral status begins. A reasonable consensus is to protect access early in pregnancy and in cases of rape, incest, or serious risks to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health, while allowing democratically set, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy that include clear medical exceptions and do not impose undue burdens. Policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, strong maternal healthcare, and economic supports for parents.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for bodily autonomy with serious consideration for developing fetal life, recognizing that people hold sincere, deeply held views on both. A workable approach is to protect access to abortion early in pregnancy while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based regulations later, with clear exceptions for threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health and for cases like rape or incest. Policy should also invest in prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postnatal care, and economic assistance\u2014so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and fewer feel forced into any decision.",
    "Laws on abortion should aim to respect the moral significance many place on potential life while also safeguarding the health, autonomy, and equal citizenship of pregnant people. A workable framework can reduce unwanted pregnancies through education and contraception, ensure timely access at least in early pregnancy, and allow later restrictions with clear exceptions for rape or incest and for threats to life or serious health. Policies should be guided by medical evidence and due process rather than punishment, supporting families and clinicians while leaving room for sincere moral disagreement.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential fetal life with protection of the pregnant person\u2019s health, dignity, and ability to make deeply personal decisions. A workable consensus is to ensure timely, safe access\u2014especially early in pregnancy\u2014while allowing carefully limited restrictions later that include clear exceptions for threats to life or health, severe fetal anomalies, and pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong medical and social supports for people who choose to carry a pregnancy to term."
