    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect personal autonomy while also acknowledging that many people place moral value on developing fetal life, so policy should reduce the need for abortion and protect health and safety. A balanced approach can preserve access to timely, evidence-based care\u2014especially in emergencies and for severe fetal conditions\u2014while allowing reasonable, medically grounded limits that do not impose undue burdens. Across viewpoints, common ground includes supporting contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and parenting support, and social services so fewer people face crisis pregnancies and decisions are made with dignity and compassion."
