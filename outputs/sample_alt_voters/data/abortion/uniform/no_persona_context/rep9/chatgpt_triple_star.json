    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both the dignity of pregnant people and the developing human life, recognizing that citizens differ deeply on when moral status begins. A reasonable framework can preserve access to abortion at least early in pregnancy, include carefully defined exceptions for threats to life or serious health risks, and pair any limits later in pregnancy with clear medical standards and due process so clinicians can act without fear. At the same time, governments should reduce the need for abortion by supporting contraception access, comprehensive sex education, maternal health care, and social supports for parents, while respecting freedom of conscience and ensuring no one is forced to carry a pregnancy without adequate medical and social protection."
