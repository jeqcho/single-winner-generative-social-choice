    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with protection of a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal standing in society, recognizing that people hold sincere and deeply different moral views about when life and rights begin. A workable approach is to ensure early, safe access to abortion, guarantee clear exceptions for threats to life or serious health and for cases like rape or incest, and allow increasing public interest and regulation later in pregnancy while preserving medically necessary care. At the same time, policy should reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and social services so fewer people face this decision in crisis.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy and health, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral rights begin. A workable consensus can protect access early in pregnancy and preserve clear exceptions later for serious health risks, lethal fetal conditions, and pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, while ensuring timely, affordable care. Policy should also focus on reducing unintended pregnancies and the circumstances that lead to abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and noncoercive counseling.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a balance of respect for potential life, the autonomy and health of the pregnant person, and society\u2019s responsibility to protect vulnerable individuals. A reasonable middle ground is to ensure early, safe, and legal access to abortion while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy that include clear exceptions for risks to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health and for severe fetal conditions. Policy should also reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies by expanding sex education, contraception access, and support for parents, so fewer people face this decision in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential human life with protection of the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal standing under the law. A practical middle ground is to ensure safe, legal access early in pregnancy and in cases involving serious health risks, rape, incest, or nonviable pregnancies, while allowing carefully defined, medically grounded limits later in pregnancy. Policy should pair any restrictions with strong supports\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and economic assistance\u2014so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and no one is forced into unsafe options.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 bodily autonomy and life circumstances with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, recognizing that people hold sincere, differing moral views about when that interest becomes compelling. A workable consensus is to ensure timely access early in pregnancy, allow later restrictions that include clear exceptions for health, life-threatening conditions, and severe fetal anomalies, and guarantee due process and equitable access regardless of income or location. Alongside legal rules, policy should reduce unintended pregnancies and abortion demand through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and childcare support, and robust maternal healthcare."
