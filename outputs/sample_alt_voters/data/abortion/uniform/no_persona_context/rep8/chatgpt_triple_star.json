    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for bodily autonomy with the widely held belief that developing fetal life has increasing moral significance over time, while prioritizing the health and safety of the pregnant person. A workable middle ground is to protect access early in pregnancy, allow reasonable regulations later that reflect fetal viability, and ensure clear exceptions for rape, incest, severe fetal conditions, and threats to physical or serious mental health. Policy should also expand contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and unbiased counseling so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and no one is forced into unsafe care.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral concern many people have for developing fetal life and the fundamental interest in protecting a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship. A workable approach is to set clear, evidence-based protections for maternal health and life, ensure timely access early in pregnancy, and allow increasing safeguards for potential fetal life later in pregnancy with exceptions for serious health risks, severe fetal conditions, and circumstances like rape or incest. Policy should reduce the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and strong supports for parents, while keeping decisions grounded in medical expertise and individual conscience rather than political coercion.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect individual bodily autonomy while also recognizing the moral concern many people feel about potential life, focusing on reducing harm rather than imposing a single moral view. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy, allow reasonable regulations tied to medical evidence and patient safety, and include clear exceptions for risks to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health, severe fetal conditions, and pregnancies from rape or incest. Alongside legal rules, governments should invest in contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and parenting support, and unbiased counseling so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and those who do can make informed decisions.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral seriousness many attach to potential human life and the need to protect a pregnant person\u2019s health, bodily autonomy, and equal participation in society. A workable middle ground is to keep abortion legal and accessible early in pregnancy, allow for reasonable regulations tied to medical evidence (not punishment), and ensure later-pregnancy limits include clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life, health, and severe fetal conditions. Alongside any legal framework, governments should reduce unintended pregnancies and the demand for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and social supports for parents.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for bodily autonomy, guided by medical evidence and compassion for people facing complex circumstances. A reasonable framework can protect access early in pregnancy while allowing increasing regulation later, with clear exceptions to safeguard the pregnant person\u2019s life and health and in cases such as rape or severe fetal anomaly. Policies should also reduce the need for abortion through robust sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and support for parents, aiming to uphold dignity, safety, and fairness for all involved."
