    "Laws on abortion should aim to protect both personal autonomy and respect for developing human life by focusing on reducing harm and supporting informed, compassionate decision-making. A workable middle ground is to ensure timely access early in pregnancy while allowing carefully defined, medically grounded limits later, with clear exceptions for threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health, severe fetal conditions, and cases of rape or incest. Across all views, common priorities include preventing unwanted pregnancies through education and contraception, providing prenatal and parenting support, and ensuring decisions are made safely, privately, and with medical oversight rather than political interference."
