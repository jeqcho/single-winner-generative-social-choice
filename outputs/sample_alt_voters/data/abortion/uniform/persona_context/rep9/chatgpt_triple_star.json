    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect human life while also respecting the health, autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people, recognizing that sincere moral and religious beliefs differ on when personhood begins. A workable approach is to reduce the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, accessible contraception, and strong support for parents, while keeping abortion safely available at least in early pregnancy and clearly permitted in cases such as threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health, rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies. Policies should be grounded in medical evidence and crafted to minimize harm, with clear standards that allow clinicians to act without fear and that treat all involved with compassion."
