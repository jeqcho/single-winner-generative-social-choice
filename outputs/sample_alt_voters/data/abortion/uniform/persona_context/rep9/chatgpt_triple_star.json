    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with the reality that pregnancy directly affects a person\u2019s health, autonomy, and future, and they should be grounded in medical evidence and constitutional protections. A workable middle ground is to protect access early in pregnancy while allowing reasonable regulations aimed at safety and informed consent, and to include clear exceptions for risks to the pregnant person\u2019s life or serious health complications, as well as for cases like rape or incest. To reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortions, policy should also expand contraception access, comprehensive sex education, and support for parents and children.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral concern many have for developing human life and the rights, health, and personal circumstances of pregnant people. A workable approach is to preserve access early in pregnancy and to ensure clear, timely exceptions for threats to life or serious health, pregnancies from rape or incest, and severe fetal conditions, while setting later-term limits that reflect medical reality and broad ethical concerns. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and fair workplace protections, grounding decisions in medical evidence, compassion, and individual privacy.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral concern many people have for potential life and the fundamental importance of a pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal participation in society. A workable middle ground protects access to abortion at least in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, or fatal fetal conditions, while allowing democratically set, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy with clear medical exceptions and without criminalizing patients or clinicians. Policymaking should also reduce the need for abortion through broad support for contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and resources for parents, alongside compassionate, nonjudgmental counseling.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral value many place on developing life and the pregnant person\u2019s right to health, bodily autonomy, and equal participation in society. A workable middle ground protects access to safe, legal abortion\u2014especially in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risks, rape, or incest\u2014while allowing reasonable, evidence-based regulations later in pregnancy that do not create undue burdens. At the same time, policy should reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through contraception access, comprehensive sex education, and support for parents, so fewer people face this decision.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, aiming to reduce harm rather than impose a single moral view. A workable middle ground is to protect access early in pregnancy, allow later restrictions that include clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health as well as severe fetal conditions, and ensure timely care in cases of rape or incest. Across viewpoints, governments can also invest in prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum healthcare, and family assistance\u2014so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and fewer feel forced into any choice."
