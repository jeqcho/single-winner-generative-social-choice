Where limits are set, they should be tied to fetal development and viability, paired with explicit exceptions for threats to life or serious health, pregnancies from sexual violence, and diagnoses incompatible with survival, with transparent review processes that do not delay treatment. At the same time, governments should reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, medically accurate education, and real supports for pregnancy, parenting, and adoption so choices are less constrained by crisis or poverty.",
