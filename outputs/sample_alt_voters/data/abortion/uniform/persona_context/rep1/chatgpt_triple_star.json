    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 autonomy and health with society\u2019s interest in protecting developing life, recognizing that people hold sincere, conflicting moral beliefs about when moral status begins. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to safe medical care\u2014especially in early pregnancy\u2014while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy with clear exceptions for serious health risks, fatal fetal conditions, and pregnancies from rape or incest. Policy should also prioritize prevention and support through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postnatal care, and economic protections so fewer people face unwanted or medically risky pregnancies.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect the moral seriousness of ending potential life while also protecting the health, dignity, and autonomy of pregnant individuals. A workable middle ground is to ensure access to safe, legal abortion at least in early pregnancy and in cases of rape, incest, or serious health risks, while allowing increasing protections for fetal life as pregnancy progresses. Policymaking should be guided by medical evidence, privacy, and equal access to care, alongside support for contraception, prenatal care, and social services that help people carry pregnancies to term when they choose.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for bodily autonomy with a serious recognition of developing fetal life, while prioritizing the health, safety, and dignity of pregnant people. A workable approach is to protect broad access early in pregnancy, allow increasing regulation as fetal viability approaches, and always preserve clear exceptions for medical emergencies, severe fetal anomalies, and pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Across all viewpoints, policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust support for parents and children.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 autonomy and health with sincere concerns about fetal life, guided by medical evidence and widely shared principles of dignity and compassion. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to safe care, guarantee clear exceptions for threats to life or serious health risks and for cases like rape or incest, and allow increasing safeguards as pregnancy progresses in line with fetal development and clinical realities. Alongside any legal framework, society should invest in prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, contraception access, prenatal and parenting resources, and adoption services\u2014so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and more families can thrive.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with the rights, health, and autonomy of the pregnant person, recognizing that people hold sincere and differing moral beliefs about when life deserves legal protection. A practical consensus is to protect access to abortion early in pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, incest, or severe fetal anomalies, while allowing greater regulation later with clear, evidence-based medical exceptions. At the same time, policy should reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, maternal healthcare, and social supports for families."
