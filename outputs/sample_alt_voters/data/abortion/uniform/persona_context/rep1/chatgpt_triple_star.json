    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for personal autonomy and bodily integrity with the widely held interest in protecting potential life, recognizing that people draw moral lines in different places. A workable approach is to keep abortion broadly accessible early in pregnancy, and allow increasing regulation later, while preserving clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health and for severe fetal conditions. At the same time, policy should reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong medical and social supports for those who choose to carry pregnancies to term."
