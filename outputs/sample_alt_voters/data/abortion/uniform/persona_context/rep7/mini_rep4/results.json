Any restrictions should be tied to clinical viability and medical evidence, include prompt exceptions for life and serious health threats, sexual violence, and severe fetal conditions, and be administered through healthcare oversight rather than criminal prosecution of patients. Alongside this, governments should lower the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, accurate sex education, maternal and mental-health care, and practical supports like childcare, paid leave, and adoption resources.",
