    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both personal autonomy and respect for developing life by setting clear, evidence-based standards that reflect medical realities and widely shared values. A workable middle ground can include guaranteed access early in pregnancy, robust protections for cases involving serious health risks, rape or incest, and meaningful limits later in pregnancy except when necessary to protect the patient\u2019s life or health. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and postpartum support, and resources that help families raise children. Decisions should prioritize privacy, compassion, and the best available medical guidance, while allowing democratic accountability and safeguards against coercion."
