    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect the moral seriousness many attach to potential life while also protecting the health, autonomy, and equal citizenship of pregnant people. A workable consensus is to guarantee access to safe, legal abortion at least in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, incest, or severe fetal anomaly, while allowing appropriately tailored regulations later in pregnancy that do not create undue burdens or delay care. Policy should also reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust support for parents, alongside transparent medical standards and safeguards against coercion.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for pregnant people\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, while recognizing that sincere moral and religious convictions differ. A reasonable approach protects access to safe, timely abortion care at least in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape or incest, or fatal fetal anomalies, alongside clear medical exceptions that let clinicians act without fear of prosecution. It should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and parenting supports, and resources that help families carry pregnancies to term when they choose.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s autonomy and health, acknowledging that people hold sincere, deeply rooted moral views on both sides. A workable middle ground protects access to safe, legal abortion at least in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, or severe fetal anomaly, while allowing increasing regulation later in pregnancy that is grounded in medical evidence and includes clear exceptions. Alongside any legal framework, society should invest in contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and postnatal care, and economic supports so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and fewer feel pressured by circumstances in either direction.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s health, bodily autonomy, and ability to make deeply personal decisions. A workable consensus is to protect early access to abortion while allowing increasing regulation later in pregnancy, with clear exceptions whenever a pregnancy threatens the patient\u2019s life or serious health, or in cases of rape or incest. Policy should also focus on shared goals\u2014reducing unintended pregnancies through education and contraception, supporting parents and children, and ensuring compassionate, evidence-based medical care without criminalizing patients or clinicians acting in good faith.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a commitment to both respecting the moral seriousness many attach to fetal life and protecting the health, autonomy, and equal citizenship of pregnant people. A workable middle ground can pair broad, timely access to care early in pregnancy with increasing safeguards and clearer justifications as pregnancy progresses, while ensuring exceptions for rape, incest, fatal fetal conditions, and serious threats to a patient\u2019s life or health. Policy should focus on reducing unintended pregnancies through contraception access, comprehensive education, and social supports, and on keeping decisions as medically informed, private, and free from undue burdens as possible."
