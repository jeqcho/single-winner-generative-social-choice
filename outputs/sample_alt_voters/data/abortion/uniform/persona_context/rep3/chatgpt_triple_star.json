    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect individual autonomy while also acknowledging society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, especially as a pregnancy progresses. A practical middle ground is to ensure timely access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy, paired with evidence-based health standards and a framework that allows more regulation later with clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and serious health risks, and for pregnancies involving rape, incest, or fatal fetal anomalies. Policy should also expand contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and economic supports that reduce unintended pregnancies and make parenting feasible, so fewer people face this decision in crisis."
