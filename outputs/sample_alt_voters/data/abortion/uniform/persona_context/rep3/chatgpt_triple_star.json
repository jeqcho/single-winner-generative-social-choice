    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for developing fetal life with protection of the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal participation in society. A workable middle ground is to safeguard access to abortion early in pregnancy and ensure exceptions later when serious health risks, severe fetal conditions, or circumstances like rape or incest are involved, while allowing reasonable, evidence-based regulations that do not create undue barriers. Policy should prioritize reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust support for parents, and it should be shaped by medical expertise and individual conscience rather than punitive measures.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect personal autonomy and health while recognizing the sincere moral concerns many hold about potential life. A balanced approach is to keep abortion safe, legal, and accessible early in pregnancy, with later-term limits that allow clear exceptions for serious risks to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health and for severe fetal conditions. Policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, strong prenatal and maternal support, and protections against coercion in any direction.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, acknowledging that people disagree deeply about when moral personhood begins. A workable consensus is to protect access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy, allow increasing regulation as pregnancy progresses, and ensure clear exceptions when the pregnant person\u2019s life or health is at serious risk or when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. Alongside legal rules, governments should reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and robust social supports for parents.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for developing human life with the reality that pregnancy profoundly affects a person\u2019s health, autonomy, and circumstances. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy, ensure clear exceptions for threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health and for severe fetal anomalies, and allow reasonable, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and economic supports for families, while safeguarding conscience rights and preventing harassment in healthcare settings.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect women\u2019s health and autonomy while also recognizing that many people attribute moral value to developing fetal life. A practical middle ground is to ensure early pregnancy access to safe, legal abortion, coupled with evidence-based limits later in pregnancy that include clear exceptions for threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or serious health, severe fetal conditions, and pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Policies should emphasize prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postnatal care, and resources for parents\u2014so fewer people face unwanted pregnancies and fewer need abortions."
