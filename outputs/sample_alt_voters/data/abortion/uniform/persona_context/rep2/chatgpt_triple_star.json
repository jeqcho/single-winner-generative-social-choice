    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both the dignity of pregnant individuals and the developing fetus by balancing personal autonomy with a growing state interest in potential life as pregnancy progresses. A practical middle ground is to ensure early, timely access to safe abortion care while permitting carefully limited regulations later in pregnancy that include clear, workable exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health and for severe fetal conditions. Policy should reduce unwanted pregnancies and late-term abortions through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, prenatal and parenting supports, and unbiased medical counseling, while preserving freedom of conscience and respectful public dialogue.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential human life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and ability to make deeply personal decisions. A reasonable middle ground is to protect broad access early in pregnancy and ensure exceptions later when serious health risks, severe fetal conditions, or circumstances like rape or incest are involved, while setting clear, evidence-based medical standards. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and postpartum care, and social supports for families.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect the moral seriousness many people attach to fetal life while also protecting the health, autonomy, and equal citizenship of those who are pregnant. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to abortion at least in early pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, or lethal fetal conditions, while allowing more regulation later in pregnancy that is narrowly tailored and never blocks medically necessary care. Across the spectrum, we can agree on reducing the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and child support, and healthcare so that fewer people face unwanted or unsafe choices.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 bodily autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral status begins. A workable approach is to keep abortion broadly accessible early in pregnancy, while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based limits later that include clear exceptions for threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health, severe fetal anomalies, and pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion through accessible contraception, comprehensive sex education, robust prenatal and childcare support, and a commitment to medically informed, compassionate care rather than punishment.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should protect personal autonomy and health while recognizing that many people place moral value on developing fetal life. A workable consensus is to ensure early access to safe, legal abortion and contraception, with later-pregnancy limits that allow clear exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health, severe fetal anomalies, and cases like rape or incest, alongside fair, timely medical review when needed. Policymaking should be grounded in medical evidence, privacy, and due process, and paired with supports\u2014sex education, prenatal care, childcare, and economic assistance\u2014that reduce unintended pregnancies and make carrying a pregnancy to term more feasible."
