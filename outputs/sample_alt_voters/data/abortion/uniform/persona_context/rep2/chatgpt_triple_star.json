    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual bodily autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting developing life, recognizing that people hold sincere and deeply held beliefs on both sides. A workable approach is to ensure access to early pregnancy abortion with appropriate medical safeguards, while allowing greater regulation later in pregnancy except when needed to protect the pregnant person\u2019s life, health, or in cases of severe fetal anomaly. At the same time, policy should reduce unintended pregnancies and the perceived need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, robust prenatal care, and practical support for parents."
