    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral seriousness many attach to fetal life and the fundamental interests of pregnant people in health, autonomy, and equal participation in society. A workable middle ground is to ensure safe, legal access early in pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, or severe fetal anomaly, while allowing carefully limited regulations later in pregnancy that protect potential life without forcing unsafe or medically unnecessary barriers. Policy should prioritize evidence-based medicine, informed consent, privacy, and social supports that reduce unintended pregnancy and make parenthood more feasible.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy and health, recognizing that people hold sincere, deeply rooted moral and religious disagreements. A workable consensus is to protect access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy and to allow later abortions when there are serious threats to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health or when severe fetal conditions are present, while setting reasonable regulations that do not create undue burdens. At the same time, policy should reduce unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, accessible contraception, and robust support for parents and children, and it should respect conscience rights for individuals without blocking patients\u2019 access to care.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a balance of respect for potential life and respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and lived circumstances, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when and how moral obligations arise. A durable approach can protect access to early, safe care and ensure clear exceptions when health or life is at risk, while allowing for graduated regulation later in pregnancy based on fetal development and medical realities. Policy should also focus on shared goals\u2014reducing unintended pregnancies through education and contraception, supporting prenatal and parental care, and providing resources that make choosing to continue a pregnancy more feasible.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential human life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and equal citizenship. A workable middle ground is to protect broad access early in pregnancy, ensure clear exceptions when pregnancy threatens health or involves rape, incest, or severe fetal anomalies, and allow increasing state interest later in pregnancy without imposing medically unnecessary barriers. Policymaking should be guided by sound medical evidence, privacy protections, and support for reducing unintended pregnancies through contraception, sex education, and economic and family supports.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people hold sincere, differing moral beliefs about when life and rights begin. A workable approach is to protect access\u2014especially early in pregnancy and in cases of serious health risk, rape, or incest\u2014while allowing increasing state interest in fetal development later on, paired with clear medical exceptions and due-process safeguards. Regardless of where legal lines are drawn, policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies and abortions by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal support, and resources for parents."
