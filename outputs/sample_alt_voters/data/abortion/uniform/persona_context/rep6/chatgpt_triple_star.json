    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect the dignity and autonomy of pregnant individuals while also acknowledging society\u2019s interest in protecting developing life. A reasonable middle ground is to keep early pregnancy decisions primarily with the patient and clinician, and to allow greater regulation later in pregnancy with clear, evidence-based exceptions for the person\u2019s life, serious health risks, and severe fetal conditions. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding access to contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and social supports for families."
