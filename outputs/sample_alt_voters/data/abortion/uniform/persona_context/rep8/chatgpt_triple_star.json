    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the serious moral value many place on prenatal life and the fundamental health, safety, and autonomy interests of pregnant individuals. A reasonable middle ground is to ensure early and timely access to abortion services, while allowing carefully limited regulations later in pregnancy that prioritize medical judgment and include clear exceptions for threats to life or health, severe fetal conditions, and cases of rape or incest. Policy should focus on reducing unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust support for parents, while keeping decisions grounded in evidence-based medicine and privacy.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for developing human life with respect for pregnant people\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, recognizing that reasonable people disagree about when moral and legal protections should begin. A workable consensus is to prioritize preventing unwanted pregnancies and supporting parents, allow abortion early in pregnancy, and permit it later when serious health risks, severe fetal conditions, or profound hardship are present, with clear medical standards. Policymaking should be grounded in evidence, protect patient privacy and clinician judgment, and ensure access to comprehensive healthcare and social supports so fewer people face this decision.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral concern many people have for potential life and the need to protect the health, autonomy, and equal citizenship of pregnant individuals. A workable approach is to set policy around widely shared goals\u2014preventing unwanted pregnancies through education and contraception, ensuring access to timely, evidence-based medical care, and allowing exceptions when pregnancy results from rape or incest or threatens a person\u2019s life or serious health. Within these guardrails, decisions should be guided by medical expertise and compassion rather than punishment, with support for parents and children so fewer people feel forced into any choice.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 autonomy and health with society\u2019s interest in protecting developing life, recognizing that people differ deeply on when moral status begins. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to safe medical care\u2014especially in early pregnancy and in cases of risk to the patient\u2019s life or serious health complications\u2014while allowing greater protections as fetal development advances, grounded in medical evidence and due process. Across viewpoints, common ground includes reducing unintended pregnancies through education and contraception, supporting parents and children through social services, and keeping decisions and standards guided by healthcare expertise rather than stigma or coercion.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for developing fetal life with the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal participation in society, recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious differences about when personhood begins. A workable consensus is to protect access early in pregnancy, allow later restrictions that include clear exceptions for health and life, and ensure decisions remain grounded in medical evidence rather than punishment. Alongside legal limits, policymakers should reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and addressing economic and health inequities."
