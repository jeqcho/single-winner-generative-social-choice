    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both the well-being and autonomy of pregnant people and the developing life they carry, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral and legal protections should begin. A workable approach is to ensure timely access to safe, legal care early in pregnancy, with increasing state interest as pregnancy advances, while always preserving exceptions for threats to life or serious health risks and for pregnancies involving rape or incest. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and maternal healthcare, and social supports so fewer people face unwanted or untenable pregnancies."
