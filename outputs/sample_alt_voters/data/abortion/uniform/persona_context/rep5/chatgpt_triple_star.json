    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, health, and life, recognizing that people hold sincere, differing moral views about when moral status begins. A workable approach is to protect access to safe, legal abortion at least in early pregnancy and always when needed to safeguard the person\u2019s life or serious health, while allowing carefully defined, evidence-based limits later in pregnancy that include clear exceptions. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and parental support, and addressing factors that drive unintended pregnancy."
