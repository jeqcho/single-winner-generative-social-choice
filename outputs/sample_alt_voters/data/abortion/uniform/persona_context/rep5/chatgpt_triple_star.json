    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for bodily autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting developing life, recognizing that people hold sincere and differing moral views about when that protection should begin. A practical middle ground is to ensure access to early pregnancy abortion and high-quality reproductive healthcare, while allowing increasing protections later in pregnancy with clear exceptions to safeguard the pregnant person\u2019s life and health and in cases of severe fetal anomaly. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and robust support for parents and families so fewer people face unwanted or unsafe pregnancies.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant people\u2019s autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, recognizing that reasonable people disagree about when moral status begins. A workable approach is to keep early pregnancy decisions primarily between the individual and their clinician, while allowing increasing protections later in pregnancy alongside clear exceptions for threats to life or serious health, rape or incest, and lethal fetal conditions. Across all views, policy should prioritize reducing unintended pregnancies and abortions through contraception access, evidence-based sex education, prenatal and postnatal support, and safeguards against coercion.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral seriousness many attach to fetal life and the fundamental rights, health, and autonomy of pregnant people. A workable approach is to ensure early, safe access to abortion, guarantee clear exceptions later in pregnancy for risks to life or serious health, fetal anomalies, and cases of rape or incest, and emphasize informed, voluntary decision-making rather than punishment. At the same time, governments can invest in measures that reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion\u2014such as comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and economic support for families\u2014so fewer people face this choice.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal access to medical care, while recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral status begins. A reasonable framework protects access early in pregnancy, allows later restrictions that increase with fetal development, and preserves clear exceptions for threats to the patient\u2019s life or serious health, nonviable pregnancies, and circumstances such as rape or incest. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception, comprehensive sex education, maternal healthcare, and economic supports for families.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 bodily autonomy with society\u2019s interest in potential life, recognizing that people hold sincere, deeply held moral and religious differences about when moral status begins. A workable approach is to protect safe, legal access early in pregnancy while allowing carefully limited, evidence-based regulations later that include clear health exceptions and consider severe fetal conditions, with decisions grounded in medical expertise and patient well-being. At the same time, governments should reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and childcare support, and protections against coercion so fewer people face unwanted or unsafe choices."
