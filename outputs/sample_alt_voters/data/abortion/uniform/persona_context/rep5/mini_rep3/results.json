To reduce conflict and the number of unwanted pregnancies, the law should also invest in prevention and family support\u2014accurate education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum (including mental health) care, and practical help with parenting, disability needs, or adoption\u2014while avoiding punitive approaches that drive care underground.",
