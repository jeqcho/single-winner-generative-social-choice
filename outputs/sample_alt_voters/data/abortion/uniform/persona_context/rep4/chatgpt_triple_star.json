    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for the pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy and health, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when and how moral status develops. A workable consensus is to protect access early in pregnancy, ensure clear exceptions later for serious threats to life or health and for pregnancies involving rape or incest, and support informed, non-coercive counseling. Alongside legal rules, governments should reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through affordable contraception, comprehensive sex education, prenatal care, and social supports for parents."
