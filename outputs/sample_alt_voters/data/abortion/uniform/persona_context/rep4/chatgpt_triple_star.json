    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for prenatal life with the pregnant person\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal participation in society, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral status begins. A workable consensus can protect access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy while allowing appropriately tailored limits later, with clear exceptions for risks to life or serious health, rape or incest, and severe fetal conditions. Policy should also focus on shared goals\u2014reducing unintended pregnancies and supporting parents\u2014through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal care, and economic supports so fewer people face the decision in the first place.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for pregnant people\u2019s health, autonomy, and equal standing, recognizing that citizens disagree in good faith about when moral personhood begins. A workable consensus is to protect broad access early in pregnancy, ensure exceptions when a pregnancy endangers the patient\u2019s life or health or results from rape or incest, and allow increasing protections for fetal development later, while avoiding punitive measures that deter medical care. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and parenting support, and robust healthcare and social services.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect the moral seriousness of ending potential life while protecting the health, autonomy, and equal citizenship of pregnant people. A balanced approach can allow access early in pregnancy and ensure exceptions when a pregnancy endangers life or serious health, results from rape or incest, or involves severe fetal anomalies, while also supporting measures that reduce unintended pregnancies through education, contraception, and social supports. Policy should be grounded in medical evidence and privacy, avoid criminalizing patients and clinicians, and leave room for individual conscience within clear, humane safeguards.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for developing human life with respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 autonomy, health, and circumstances, recognizing that people disagree in good faith about when moral personhood begins. A consensus approach is to prioritize preventing unintended pregnancies through education and contraception, ensure safe and timely care especially in cases of serious health risk, rape, or incest, and allow increasing protections for fetal life as pregnancy progresses while preserving clear medical exceptions. Policymaking should be grounded in evidence, compassion, and practical outcomes\u2014reducing harm, supporting families, and trusting medical expertise rather than criminalizing patients or clinicians.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral concerns many hold about developing fetal life and the right of pregnant people to make serious medical decisions about their own bodies and futures. A workable approach is to protect access to safe, legal abortion early in pregnancy, allow later procedures when serious health risks or severe fetal conditions are present, and ensure clear medical exceptions without fear of prosecution. At the same time, policy should reduce unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and support for parents, while safeguarding freedom of conscience so no one is forced to provide or undergo an abortion."
