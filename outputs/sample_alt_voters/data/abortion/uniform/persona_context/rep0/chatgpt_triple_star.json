    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to protect both personal autonomy and respect for developing life by grounding policy in compassion, evidence-based medicine, and widely shared values. A workable middle ground can affirm access to safe, legal care\u2014especially in cases of serious health risk, rape, incest, or nonviable pregnancy\u2014while allowing reasonable, medically informed regulations as pregnancy progresses. At the same time, governments should reduce the need for abortion through support for contraception, prenatal and parental care, and economic protections, and ensure that no one is coerced\u2014either into ending a pregnancy or carrying one against their will.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral seriousness many attach to fetal life and the rights, health, and dignity of pregnant people, recognizing that sincere citizens differ on when and how those interests should be weighed. A workable consensus is to protect access to safe, legal abortion at least early in pregnancy and when a pregnancy threatens health or results from rape or incest, while allowing greater regulation later based on fetal development and medical judgment. At the same time, policy should reduce the need for abortion through strong support for contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and economic and parenting resources, and it should protect conscience rights without blocking timely medical care.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should aim to respect both the moral value many place on potential life and the fundamental health, dignity, and decision-making autonomy of pregnant individuals. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy and to ensure later-term abortions remain available when serious medical risks, severe fetal anomalies, or compelling circumstances arise, with decisions guided by patients and clinicians rather than punitive enforcement. Alongside legal standards, governments should reduce the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, robust prenatal and childcare support, and protections for families and providers.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for a pregnant person\u2019s bodily autonomy, recognizing that reasonable people weigh these values differently. A workable approach is to protect access early in pregnancy while allowing carefully defined limits later based on fetal viability and serious health considerations, with clear exceptions for risks to the pregnant person\u2019s life or health and for pregnancies from rape or incest. Policy should also reduce the need for abortion by expanding contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and parenting support, and healthcare that is affordable and nonjudgmental.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for potential life with respect for pregnant individuals\u2019 health, autonomy, and equal citizenship, recognizing that people hold sincere moral and religious differences about when personhood begins. A workable approach is to ensure accessible contraception and prenatal support, allow abortion early in pregnancy with informed consent, and maintain clear exceptions later for threats to life or serious health, fatal fetal conditions, and pregnancies from rape or incest. Policy should aim to reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through education and social supports, while keeping decisions grounded in medical evidence and protecting patient privacy and clinician judgment."
