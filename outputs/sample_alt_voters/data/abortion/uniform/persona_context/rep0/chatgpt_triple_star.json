    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for individual bodily autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting developing human life, recognizing that people differ in good-faith beliefs about when moral status begins. A workable consensus is to keep abortion broadly accessible early in pregnancy, require later-term procedures to be limited to serious medical circumstances (including threats to health) and severe fetal conditions, and ensure decisions are guided by medical judgment rather than politics. Policy should also reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum support, and protections for patients and clinicians."
