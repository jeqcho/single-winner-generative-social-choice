    "The government should ensure that every resident has access to affordable, essential healthcare by setting clear coverage standards and providing financial support where markets fall short, while still allowing room for private options and innovation. Those who favor a stronger public system can rely on government to guarantee basic protections and reduce disparities, and those who prioritize choice can keep diverse plans and providers competing. A pragmatic approach is to fund and regulate for universal access, measure outcomes and costs transparently, and use a mix of public programs and private delivery to meet shared goals of health, fairness, and fiscal responsibility."
