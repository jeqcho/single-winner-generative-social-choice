    "The government should help guarantee that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing room for private providers and consumer choice where they add value. A practical middle ground is to set clear national standards, fund coverage for those who cannot afford it, and negotiate costs and transparency, without requiring a single one-size-fits-all delivery system. This approach respects concerns about taxes and efficiency while recognizing that health security and preventive care benefit society and the economy as a whole."
