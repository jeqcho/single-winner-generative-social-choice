    "The government should ensure that everyone can access affordable, essential healthcare by setting clear national standards, funding coverage for those who would otherwise go without, and protecting patients from catastrophic costs. At the same time, it can preserve individual choice and encourage innovation by allowing a mix of public and private options and using market-based tools where they improve quality and efficiency. This approach balances a shared commitment to basic health security with concerns about cost, flexibility, and the proper scope of government."
