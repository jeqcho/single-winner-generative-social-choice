    "Government should ensure that every resident has access to essential, affordable healthcare by setting clear coverage standards and providing financial support where the market falls short, while leaving room for private insurers and providers to innovate and offer additional options. This approach recognizes concerns about cost, taxes, and bureaucracy, alongside the reality that untreated illness harms families, employers, and public health. A practical middle path is a basic universal guarantee with transparent outcomes, competition where it improves quality, and strong cost controls and accountability to protect taxpayers and patients."
