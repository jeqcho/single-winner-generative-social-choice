    "The government should help ensure that everyone can access essential, high-quality healthcare, while allowing flexibility in how coverage is delivered through a mix of public programs and regulated private options. Supporters of a larger public role can agree on strong protections\u2014such as guaranteed coverage, subsidies for those who need them, and safeguards against denial for preexisting conditions\u2014while those favoring market solutions can support competition, choice, and innovation within clear rules. A balanced approach would set national standards for affordability and outcomes, use transparent oversight to control costs, and leave room for states and providers to tailor implementation to local needs."
