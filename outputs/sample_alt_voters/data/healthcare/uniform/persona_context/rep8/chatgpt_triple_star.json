    "The government should ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing flexibility in how that coverage is delivered through a mix of public programs and regulated private options. This approach recognizes concerns about cost, choice, and innovation, alongside the belief that no one should be denied care due to income or preexisting conditions. A balanced role includes setting basic standards, funding or subsidizing coverage for those who need it, and promoting competition and transparency to control costs and improve quality."
