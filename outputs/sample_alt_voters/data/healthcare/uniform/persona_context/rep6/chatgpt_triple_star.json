    "Government should ensure that everyone can access essential, high-quality healthcare without financial ruin, while allowing flexibility in how that coverage is delivered through a mix of public programs and regulated private options. This approach respects concerns about individual choice, innovation, and cost control, while recognizing that markets alone often leave gaps in coverage and affordability. A practical middle ground is to set clear national standards, subsidize those who need help, and hold providers and insurers accountable for transparent pricing, quality, and efficient outcomes."
