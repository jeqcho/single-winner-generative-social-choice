    "The government should ensure that everyone can access essential, affordable healthcare by setting clear standards, providing targeted subsidies, and maintaining a reliable safety net, while allowing room for private providers and consumer choice. Those who favor a larger public role can see universal access and protection from catastrophic costs, and those wary of government overreach can support competition, innovation, and flexibility in how care is delivered. A balanced approach emphasizes transparency, cost control, and accountability so public funds are used efficiently and outcomes improve for patients."
