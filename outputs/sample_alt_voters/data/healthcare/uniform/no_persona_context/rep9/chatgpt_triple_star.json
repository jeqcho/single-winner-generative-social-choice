    "The government should ensure that everyone can access essential, high-quality healthcare without financial ruin, while allowing flexibility in how that coverage is delivered. A balanced approach is to set clear national standards, provide income-based subsidies and protections, and fill gaps for those the market won\u2019t reliably serve, while preserving room for private insurers and providers to compete and innovate. This can bring broad coverage and cost control together with patient choice and fiscal responsibility."
