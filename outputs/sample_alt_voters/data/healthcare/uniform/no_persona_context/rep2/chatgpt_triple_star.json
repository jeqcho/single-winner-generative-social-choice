    "The government should ensure that everyone can access essential, high-quality healthcare without facing financial ruin, while allowing flexibility in how that coverage is delivered. This can mean setting clear national standards, funding support for those who need it, and regulating insurers and providers for transparency and fair competition, while preserving room for private options and innovation. A balanced approach protects the vulnerable and public health, respects individual choice, and focuses on measurable outcomes like affordability, access, and quality."
