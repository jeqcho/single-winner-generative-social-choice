    "The government should help ensure that everyone can access essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing room for a mix of public and private options. A reasonable approach is to set baseline standards, provide subsidies or coverage for those who can\u2019t afford care, and protect consumers through transparency and competition, rather than relying on a single one-size-fits-all system. This balances concerns about equity and public health with respect for choice, innovation, and fiscal responsibility."
