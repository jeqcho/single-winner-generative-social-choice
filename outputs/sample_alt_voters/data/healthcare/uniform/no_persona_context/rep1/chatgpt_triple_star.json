    "Government should ensure that every person has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing room for a mix of public and private delivery options. Those who favor a larger public role can see this as a commitment to universal coverage and financial protection, while those concerned about choice and efficiency can support competition, innovation, and patient options within clear rules. A practical middle ground is setting national standards, funding and regulating to protect patients, and measuring outcomes, while letting states, communities, and providers implement solutions that work locally."
