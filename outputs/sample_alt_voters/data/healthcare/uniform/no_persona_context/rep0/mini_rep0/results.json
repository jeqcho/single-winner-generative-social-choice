Rather than running all care, the state should set transparent rules for benefits, pricing, and competition, and use risk-adjusted subsidies and a fallback public option or regulated default plan where markets fail. In return, providers and insurers should be paid in ways that reward outcomes, primary care, and mental-health access, with simplified enrollment and clear public reporting.
