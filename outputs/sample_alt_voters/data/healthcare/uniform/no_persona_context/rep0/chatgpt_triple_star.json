    "The government should ensure that everyone can access essential healthcare without facing financial ruin, while allowing flexibility in how coverage is delivered through a mix of public programs, regulated private options, and employer plans. People who favor a larger public role can see this as a guarantee of a basic national standard, and those who prefer market-based solutions can support it as a framework that preserves choice and competition. A balanced approach pairs public funding or subsidies with clear rules on affordability, transparency, and coverage minimums, while holding providers and insurers accountable for quality and cost control."
