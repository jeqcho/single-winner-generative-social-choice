    "The government should help ensure that everyone has access to affordable, essential healthcare, while allowing flexibility in how coverage is delivered through a mix of public programs and regulated private options. Those who favor a larger public role can be assured of a strong safety net and minimum national standards, and those who prefer market solutions can support competition and innovation within clear rules. A consensus approach is to guarantee basic coverage and protect patients from catastrophic costs, while focusing on cost transparency, quality outcomes, and fiscal sustainability."
