    "The government should ensure that every person has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing a mix of public and private options to preserve choice and encourage innovation. This can be achieved by setting clear coverage standards, providing income-based support, and protecting people with preexisting conditions, while holding insurers and providers accountable for cost and quality. In this approach, the government acts as a guarantor of access and fairness, and the healthcare system remains flexible enough to reflect different preferences and local needs."
