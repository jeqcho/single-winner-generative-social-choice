    "Government should ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing room for private options and innovation to meet different needs and preferences. A practical middle ground is setting clear coverage standards, protecting people from catastrophic costs, and using transparent regulation and targeted subsidies to expand access without mandating a single one-size-fits-all system. This approach balances individual choice and market flexibility with a shared commitment that no one is denied care due to inability to pay."
