    "The government should ensure that everyone has access to affordable, essential healthcare by setting clear coverage standards, protecting patients from catastrophic costs, and supporting a strong safety net for those who would otherwise go without care. At the same time, it can respect concerns about choice, efficiency, and innovation by allowing multiple delivery and insurance models\u2014public, private, and nonprofit\u2014so long as they meet transparency and quality requirements. This approach focuses government on guaranteeing access and fairness, while leaving room for competition and local flexibility in how care is provided."
