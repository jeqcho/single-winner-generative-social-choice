    "The government should help ensure everyone can access essential, affordable healthcare by setting clear standards, providing subsidies for those who need them, and filling gaps where markets don\u2019t reliably serve patients. At the same time, it can preserve room for private innovation and consumer choice by allowing multiple delivery and insurance options that meet those standards. This approach recognizes concerns about cost, quality, and individual freedom while committing to the shared goal that no one is denied necessary care because they can\u2019t pay."
