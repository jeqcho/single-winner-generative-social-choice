The public role should also include enforcing transparent prices, reducing administrative complexity, and paying more for prevention and primary care so costs fall over time.

Within that public guarantee, patients should keep meaningful choice and the ability to purchase supplemental private coverage, while private and community providers compete and innovate to improve quality. To keep the system sustainable, policy should pair transparent pricing, portability, streamlined administration, and anti-fraud measures with clear outcome-based standards and evidence-driven cost controls, implemented with state and local flexibility.",
