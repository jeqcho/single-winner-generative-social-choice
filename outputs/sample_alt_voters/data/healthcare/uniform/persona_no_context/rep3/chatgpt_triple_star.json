    "The government should ensure that everyone has access to affordable, essential healthcare, while allowing flexibility in how coverage is delivered through a mix of public programs and regulated private options. Those who favor a larger public role can see this as a commitment to universal access and basic protections, while those concerned about cost and choice can support measures that promote competition, transparency, and personal options. A practical middle ground is to set national standards and provide targeted subsidies and safeguards, while holding all providers and insurers accountable for quality, efficiency, and fair pricing."
