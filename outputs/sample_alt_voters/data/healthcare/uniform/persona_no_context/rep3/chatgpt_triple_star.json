    "Government should ensure that every person has access to essential, affordable healthcare by guaranteeing a baseline of coverage and supporting protections for preexisting conditions, while preserving opportunities for private innovation and choice. This approach balances public responsibility to prevent catastrophic medical costs and promote public health with respect for market-driven improvements in quality and efficiency, encouraging collaboration between public programs and private providers to expand access and control costs."
