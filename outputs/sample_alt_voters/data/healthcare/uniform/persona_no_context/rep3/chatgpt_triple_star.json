    "The government should ensure that every person can access essential, affordable healthcare by setting baseline standards, funding safety-net programs, and regulating markets to prevent discrimination and unchecked cost growth, while preserving space for private innovation and choice. By combining public support for coverage and protections with incentives for efficiency and competition in the private sector, this approach recognizes concerns about fiscal responsibility and individual freedom while prioritizing health equity and broad access."
