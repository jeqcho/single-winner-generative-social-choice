    "Government should ensure that every person has access to basic, affordable healthcare while preserving space for private innovation and choice; this can be achieved through a mixed approach that guarantees a robust public safety net for essential services and allows regulated private options for supplemental care. By setting clear standards for minimum coverage, controlling costs through targeted regulation and negotiation, and supporting preventive care and equitable funding, the government can protect public health while respecting individual preferences and market contributions."
