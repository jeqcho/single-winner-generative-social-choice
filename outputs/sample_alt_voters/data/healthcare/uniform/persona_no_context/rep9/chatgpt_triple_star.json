    "The government should help ensure that everyone can access essential healthcare, while allowing flexibility in how coverage is delivered through a mix of public programs and regulated private options. Supporters of a larger public role can see this as a commitment to universal access and basic protections, while advocates of limited government can support it if it emphasizes choice, competition, and cost transparency. A practical consensus is for government to set minimum coverage standards, subsidize those who can\u2019t afford care, and enforce fair rules, while partnering with private providers and focusing on measurable outcomes and fiscal sustainability."
