    "While opinions differ on the best path, the government should ensure that all people have reliable access to essential healthcare services and financial protection from catastrophic costs, while preserving space for private innovation and choice. A practical compromise is a mixed system where the state guarantees a baseline of high-quality primary and emergency care for everyone, funds subsidies or risk-pooling to prevent unaffordability, and works with private providers and insurers to expand capacity, improve outcomes, and control costs through transparent oversight and evidence-based regulation."
