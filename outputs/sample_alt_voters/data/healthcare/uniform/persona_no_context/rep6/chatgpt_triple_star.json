    "Government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare while preserving room for private innovation and choice; this can be achieved through a combination of public funding or safety-net programs for essential services, regulation to protect consumers and control costs, and partnership with private providers and insurers. Recognizing differing views on scope and delivery, the shared goal should be to guarantee coverage and reduce financial barriers without stifling competition or personal options for supplemental care."
