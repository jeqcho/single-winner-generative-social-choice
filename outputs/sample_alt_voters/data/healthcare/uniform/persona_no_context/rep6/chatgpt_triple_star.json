    "The government should ensure that all residents have access to essential, affordable healthcare by setting clear standards, funding safety-net programs, and removing barriers to coverage while preserving choice and innovation in care delivery. By combining public support for basic universal coverage with incentives for private sector participation and targeted subsidies for vulnerable populations, policymakers can balance fiscal responsibility, quality, and individual freedom.
