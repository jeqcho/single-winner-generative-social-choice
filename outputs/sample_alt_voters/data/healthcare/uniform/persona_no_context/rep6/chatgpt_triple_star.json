    "The government should ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing room for private insurers and providers to innovate and offer additional options. This can be done by setting clear standards, funding coverage for those who cannot afford it, and using market-based tools and competition where they reduce costs and improve quality. At the same time, strong transparency, consumer protections, and accountability measures can address concerns about bureaucracy, taxes, and choice while still preventing people from being left without care."
