    "The government should help ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing room for a mix of public and private options that respects individual choice and encourages innovation. This can be done by setting clear baseline coverage standards, funding care for those who can\u2019t afford it, and using oversight to promote transparency, competition, and cost control. At the same time, reforms should emphasize efficiency and shared responsibility so that taxpayers, employers, providers, and individuals all have incentives to improve outcomes and reduce waste."
