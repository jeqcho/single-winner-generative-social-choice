    "The government should ensure that all residents have access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare by setting standards, financing support for those who cannot pay, and regulating markets to prevent discrimination and excessive costs, while preserving space for private innovation and choice. This approach recognizes the shared value of universal coverage and the need for personal autonomy, balancing public responsibility to protect health with efficient, diverse delivery models that accommodate different preferences and local conditions."
