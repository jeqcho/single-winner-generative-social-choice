    "The government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare by setting clear standards, subsidizing care for those who cannot pay, and supporting a mix of public and private providers to encourage innovation and choice. While respecting individual responsibility and provider autonomy, the government\u2019s role should focus on regulating for fairness, funding safety nets, and investing in public health and prevention to reduce costs and improve outcomes for all."
