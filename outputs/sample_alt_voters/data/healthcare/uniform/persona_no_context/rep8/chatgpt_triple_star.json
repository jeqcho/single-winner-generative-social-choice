    "The government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare by setting standards, funding safety-net programs, and regulating to prevent discrimination and excessive costs, while preserving space for private innovation and provider choice. This approach recognizes legitimate concerns about efficiency and individual freedom by encouraging private-sector participation and competition, while affirming a shared responsibility to protect public health and prevent catastrophic medical hardship."
