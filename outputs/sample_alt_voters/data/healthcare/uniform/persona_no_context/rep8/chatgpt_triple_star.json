    "Recognizing that access to basic healthcare is critical for public wellbeing and economic stability, the government should ensure a reliable safety net that guarantees affordable, essential services for all while preserving choices and innovation in the private sector. This can be achieved through targeted public programs, subsidies, and regulation to control costs and protect vulnerable populations, paired with incentives and oversight that allow private providers and insurers to contribute efficiently and responsibly."
