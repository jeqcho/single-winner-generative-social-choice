    "The government should ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare by setting clear coverage standards, providing financial support for those who can\u2019t afford care, and protecting patients from catastrophic costs, while allowing flexibility in how services are delivered. This can respect concerns about taxes and government overreach by encouraging competition, innovation, and patient choice through a mix of public and private options. The shared goal is universal access and strong outcomes, paired with transparent accountability to control costs and maintain quality."
