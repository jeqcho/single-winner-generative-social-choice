    "Government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare services while preserving space for private innovation and choice; this can be achieved through a mix of public funding, targeted subsidies, and regulation that guarantees essential coverage and protects consumers. By focusing on universal access, cost control, and respect for individual preferences, policies can bridge concerns about equity and efficiency while allowing for diverse delivery models and continuous improvement."
