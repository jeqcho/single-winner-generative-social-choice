    "The government should ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing flexibility in how that coverage is delivered through a mix of public programs and regulated private options. Those who favor a stronger public role can support clear national standards, subsidies, and protections against denial or catastrophic costs, while those who prioritize market choice can support competition and innovation within transparent rules. A pragmatic approach is to guarantee a baseline of care, fund it fairly, and measure outcomes and costs so policies can adapt without sacrificing access or quality."
