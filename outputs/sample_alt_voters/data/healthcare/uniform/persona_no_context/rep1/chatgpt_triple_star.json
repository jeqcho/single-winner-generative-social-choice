    "Government should ensure that every person has reliable access to essential health services and protections against catastrophic medical costs while preserving space for private innovation and choice. This can be achieved by establishing baseline universal coverage and oversight to guarantee affordability, quality, and equity, alongside incentives and regulation that allow private providers and insurers to compete and improve care."
