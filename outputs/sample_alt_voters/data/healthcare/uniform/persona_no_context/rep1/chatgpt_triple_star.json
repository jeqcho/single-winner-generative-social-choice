    "Government should ensure that every person has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing flexibility in how that coverage is delivered through a mix of public programs and regulated private options. This approach recognizes concerns about cost, efficiency, and individual choice, alongside the widely shared goal of preventing medical bankruptcy and avoidable illness. By setting clear standards, providing targeted subsidies, and holding providers and insurers accountable for quality and transparency, the government can protect the public interest without requiring a one-size-fits-all system."
