    "The government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare by setting standards, providing targeted public funding for those who cannot afford care, and supporting a regulated mix of public and private providers to preserve choice and innovation. This approach recognizes concerns about cost and government overreach while affirming a shared responsibility to protect public health and reduce barriers to preventive and essential services."
