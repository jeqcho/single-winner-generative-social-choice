That guarantee can be delivered through a choice-based system that uses regulated private plans and providers alongside a strong public option or fallback, with income-based support and simple enrollment. In return, public policy should demand measurable results: transparent prices, competition where it works, firm protections against surprise billing, and payment reforms that reward outcomes and reduce waste.
