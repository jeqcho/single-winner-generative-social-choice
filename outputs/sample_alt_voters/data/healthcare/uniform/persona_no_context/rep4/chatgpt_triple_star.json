    "The government should ensure that all people have access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare while preserving room for private innovation and choice. This can be achieved by guaranteeing a core package of essential services and protections (such as preventive care, emergency services, and protections against catastrophic costs) funded or subsidized for those who cannot afford them, while allowing private insurers and providers to offer additional options and competition that drive improvements in quality and efficiency."
