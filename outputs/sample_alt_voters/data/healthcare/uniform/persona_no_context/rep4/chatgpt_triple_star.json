    "Recognizing that healthcare is essential for individual and public well-being, the government should ensure a baseline of accessible, affordable care for all while preserving space for private innovation and choice. This can be achieved through a mix of public programs to guarantee basic coverage and targeted subsidies, paired with regulatory safeguards to promote quality, control costs, and foster competition across public and private providers."
