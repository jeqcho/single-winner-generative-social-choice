    "The government should ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare while allowing flexibility in how care is delivered and financed. This can be achieved by setting universal coverage standards, protecting patients from catastrophic costs, and funding care for those who cannot afford it, while partnering with private insurers and providers to encourage choice and innovation. In return, all participants should be held to transparent quality, pricing, and accountability rules so public dollars are spent efficiently and patients receive reliable care."
