    "The government should ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare while allowing flexibility in how coverage is delivered. This can include setting clear minimum standards, providing subsidies or a public option for those who need it, and regulating transparency and competition so private and nonprofit providers can still innovate. By focusing on universal access, cost control, and measurable outcomes\u2014rather than a single one-size-fits-all model\u2014this approach respects both individual choice and the shared interest in a healthy population."
