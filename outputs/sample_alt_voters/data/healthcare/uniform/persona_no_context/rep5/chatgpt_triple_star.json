    "While people differ on the best path to universal healthcare, the government should ensure every resident has access to affordable, high-quality basic health services and protections against catastrophic medical costs, while preserving space for private innovation and choice. This can be achieved through a mix of public programs, targeted subsidies, strong regulation to control costs and ensure standards, and incentives for efficient private-sector participation that together expand coverage and improve outcomes for all."
