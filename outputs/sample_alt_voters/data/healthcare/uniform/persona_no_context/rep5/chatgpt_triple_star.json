    "The government should ensure that all residents have access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare by setting standards, providing financial support for those who cannot afford care, and removing barriers to essential services, while allowing a regulated private sector to innovate and offer additional options. This approach recognizes the shared goal of universal coverage, balances individual choice with collective responsibility, and calls for pragmatic collaboration between public programs, private providers, and community organizations to improve outcomes and control costs."
