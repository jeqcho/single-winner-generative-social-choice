To earn broad support, reforms should focus on cutting waste through price transparency, simpler billing, and strong anti-fraud enforcement, and on investing in primary and mental health care that reduces costly crises. Public subsidies should be targeted by income and health risk, with automatic enrollment and portable coverage so changing jobs or moving doesn\u2019t mean losing care. This approach protects the vulnerable and public health without crowding out private innovation or imposing one-size-fits-all medicine.",
