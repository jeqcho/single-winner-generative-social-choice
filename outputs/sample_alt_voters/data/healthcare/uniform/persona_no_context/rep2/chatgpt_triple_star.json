    "The government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare while allowing for a mix of public, private, and nonprofit providers to foster choice and innovation. By guaranteeing core services, protecting patients from catastrophic costs, and setting clear standards and oversight for equity and efficiency, policymakers can respect individual preferences and market strengths while preventing gaps in care that harm society as a whole."
