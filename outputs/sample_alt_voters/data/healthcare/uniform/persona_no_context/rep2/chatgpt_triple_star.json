    "The government should help ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare by setting clear standards, providing targeted financial support, and maintaining strong oversight for quality and transparency. At the same time, it can respect concerns about cost, choice, and innovation by allowing a mix of public and private options and using competition where it improves value. A balanced approach focuses public resources on basic coverage and protections, while giving individuals and providers flexibility in how care is delivered beyond that baseline."
