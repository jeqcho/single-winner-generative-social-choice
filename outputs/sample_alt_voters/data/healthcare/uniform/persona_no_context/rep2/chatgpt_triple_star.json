    "The government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, quality healthcare by setting baseline standards, supporting preventive care, and providing targeted assistance for those who cannot afford coverage, while preserving space for private innovation and choice. By combining public oversight, transparent regulation, and partnerships with private providers and insurers, we can protect vulnerable populations, control costs, and maintain high-quality care without eliminating options for those who prefer private plans."
