    "The government should ensure that every resident has access to affordable essential healthcare, while allowing flexibility in how that coverage is delivered through a mix of public programs, regulated private options, and market-based innovation. Those who prioritize individual choice and fiscal restraint can be supported through transparent funding, competition where it improves value, and safeguards against waste, while those who emphasize equity can be assured that no one is denied care due to cost or preexisting conditions. A practical consensus is to set universal standards for coverage, quality, and consumer protections, and then hold providers and insurers accountable for outcomes and costs."
