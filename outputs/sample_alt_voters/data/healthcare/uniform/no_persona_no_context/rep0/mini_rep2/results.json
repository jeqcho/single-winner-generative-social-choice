Within that floor, private plans and providers can compete and innovate, giving patients meaningful choice and preserving diverse delivery models while public programs focus resources on those who need help most.",

Government should guarantee a basic, affordable level of coverage with strong protections against catastrophic costs, set clear rules that prevent surprise billing and discrimination, and invest in prevention and public health. At the same time, it can preserve choice by allowing regulated private plans and providers to compete on service and outcomes, with flexibility for states and communities to tailor delivery while meeting national standards.",
