A consensus role for government is to guarantee a universal baseline of essential coverage and protections, using targeted subsidies and catastrophic cost limits so no one falls through the cracks. Government should also set clear standards for quality, equity, and transparency, curb abusive pricing and administrative waste, and measure outcomes. Within that framework, diverse public and private delivery models can compete and innovate to improve access and value.",

A broadly workable role for government is to guarantee a basic, portable level of coverage and strong consumer protections, with income-based help for those who need it, and to set transparent standards for quality and fair pricing. At the same time, it can preserve room for private plans and provider innovation, rewarding measurable outcomes, preventive care, and simpler administration so patients have real choice and costs stay under control.",
