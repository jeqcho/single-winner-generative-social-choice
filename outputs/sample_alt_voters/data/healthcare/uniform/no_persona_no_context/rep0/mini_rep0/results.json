In return for public support, all payers and providers should meet transparency and value-based rules that reward outcomes, reduce waste, and preserve meaningful patient choice.",

A broadly workable role for government is to guarantee universal basic coverage and protection from catastrophic costs, negotiate or regulate to keep prices fair, and set clear quality and transparency standards. Within that universal floor, care can be delivered through a mix of public and private providers and insurers, with room for supplemental options, competition, and local innovation.

Government should guarantee a basic, affordable package (especially for emergencies, chronic illness, and preventive care), protect patients from surprise billing and anti-competitive practices, and help those who can\u2019t pay through targeted subsidies. Beyond that floor, people should be free to choose among competing private and local options, with payment reforms that reward proven outcomes, personal responsibility, and cost-effective care.",
