A practical role for government is to guarantee a basic, portable level of coverage (especially preventive, primary, and emergency care), protect people with preexisting conditions, and improve transparency and competition by negotiating where it lowers costs and curbing surprise billing. Beyond that floor, private plans and local/community providers can offer additional options and innovations, with clear quality standards and fiscal safeguards so the system remains sustainable.",
