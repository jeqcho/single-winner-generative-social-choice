    "The government should ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing flexibility in how coverage is delivered through a mix of public programs and regulated private options. This approach recognizes concerns about cost, efficiency, and individual choice, as well as the belief that basic healthcare is a shared responsibility. By setting clear standards, providing targeted subsidies and a safety net, and promoting competition and transparency, the government can expand coverage without requiring a one-size-fits-all system."
