Within that floor, private plans, nonprofit systems, and local models can compete and innovate as long as they meet quality and access standards.",

A workable middle path is for government to guarantee a baseline of affordable coverage and protection against catastrophic costs, set clear quality and nondiscrimination standards, and invest in prevention and public health.

At the same time, it should preserve patient choice and multiple ways to deliver coverage, and use competition and value-based payment to reward efficient, high-quality care.
