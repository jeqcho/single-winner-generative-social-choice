    "The government should ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing room for private providers and consumer choice in how coverage and services are delivered. Those who favor a stronger public role can support clear national standards, subsidies, and protections against catastrophic costs, while those wary of government overreach can support market-based competition and state flexibility to innovate. A practical middle ground is a mixed system where the government guarantees a baseline of coverage and regulates for transparency and fairness, and the private sector helps expand options and efficiency."
