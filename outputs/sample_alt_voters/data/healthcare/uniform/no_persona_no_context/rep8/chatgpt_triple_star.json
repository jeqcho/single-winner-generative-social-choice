    "The government should help guarantee that everyone can access essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing flexibility in how coverage is delivered through a mix of public programs, private options, and community providers. People who favor a stronger public role can be assured that no one is left without basic care, and those who prioritize choice and innovation can retain competition and varied plan designs. A practical approach is for government to set fair rules, fund and protect coverage for vulnerable groups, and use oversight and targeted subsidies to control costs and improve outcomes without unnecessarily crowding out effective private solutions."
