    "The government should ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing room for private insurers and providers to innovate and offer additional choices. A balanced approach can combine public oversight and targeted subsidies or a baseline coverage guarantee with market competition to improve quality and control costs. This recognizes concerns about taxes and government overreach while affirming that preventable illness and financial ruin from medical bills are unacceptable outcomes in a modern society."
