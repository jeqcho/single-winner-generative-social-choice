Within that framework, private and nonprofit insurers and providers can compete on service, quality, and innovation, with payment reforms that reward better outcomes rather than higher volume.",

At the same time, it should preserve choice by allowing private plans and local delivery models, while using transparency, anti-fraud enforcement, and simpler rules to cut waste and keep costs under control.",
