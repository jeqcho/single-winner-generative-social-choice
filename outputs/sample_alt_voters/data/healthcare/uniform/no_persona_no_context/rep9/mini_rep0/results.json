To make that guarantee sustainable, government should focus on transparent rules that curb monopolistic pricing, reward primary and preventive care, and reduce administrative complexity. This approach aims for universal protection without requiring a one-size-fits-all system, balancing equity, cost discipline, and personal choice.",

Government should guarantee a universal baseline of essential coverage, with extra help for low-income and high-need patients, and set clear standards for access, transparency, and fair pricing. Within that framework, a mix of public and private providers and plans can compete and innovate, while policymakers prioritize prevention, reduce administrative waste, and measure success by outcomes and affordability.",
