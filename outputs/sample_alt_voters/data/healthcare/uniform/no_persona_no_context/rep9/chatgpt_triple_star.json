    "The government should ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing flexibility in how coverage is delivered through a mix of public programs, private plans, and regulated markets. Those who favor a larger public role can support clear guarantees and subsidies for people who would otherwise be left out, and those who prefer market solutions can support competition and choice within strong consumer protections. A practical consensus is to set universal baseline standards, fund care for vulnerable populations, and hold all insurers and providers accountable for cost transparency, quality, and equitable access."
