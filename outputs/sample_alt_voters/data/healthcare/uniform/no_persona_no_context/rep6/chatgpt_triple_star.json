    "The government should ensure that every resident has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing flexibility in how that coverage is delivered through a mix of public programs and regulated private options. To respect concerns about cost, choice, and efficiency, it should set clear minimum standards, prevent discrimination and catastrophic medical debt, and fund coverage for those who cannot afford it, while encouraging competition and innovation where appropriate. In return, providers and insurers should be held accountable for transparent pricing, quality outcomes, and responsible use of public dollars."
