A workable role for government is to guarantee a basic, affordable level of coverage and core services (especially primary, preventive, and emergency care), while using transparent rules, anti-fraud oversight, and competition-friendly standards to control costs. Beyond that baseline, people should be able to choose among public or private plan options and providers, with targeted help for low-income families and those in high-cost or rural areas. Success should be measured by simpler access, better health outcomes, and responsible spending.",
