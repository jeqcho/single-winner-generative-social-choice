    "Government should ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare by setting baseline coverage standards, protecting patients from catastrophic costs, and supporting preventive care. At the same time, it can preserve choice and innovation by allowing a mix of public and private options and using market-based incentives where they work. A balanced approach focuses on transparency, competition, and accountability so taxpayers, employers, providers, and patients share responsibility for better outcomes and sustainable spending."
