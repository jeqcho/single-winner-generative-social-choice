A bridging role for government is to guarantee a universal, clearly defined floor of essential coverage, fund targeted help for those who are most vulnerable, and enforce basic consumer protections, transparency, and quality standards. Within those guardrails, policymakers can allow multiple public and private delivery options so people retain choice and innovation can improve value, while measuring success by access, outcomes, and cost control.",
