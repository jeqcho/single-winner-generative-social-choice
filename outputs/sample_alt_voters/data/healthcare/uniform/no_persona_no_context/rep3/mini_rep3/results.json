Within that floor, policy can preserve private options and provider flexibility while using oversight and incentives to reward better outcomes and cost-effective care.",

A balanced role for government is to guarantee a basic, affordable package of essential physical and mental health care\u2014especially preventive care and protection for preexisting conditions\u2014while setting clear cost and quality standards and cracking down on waste and price gouging. Within that baseline, private plans and local providers can compete and innovate, so people keep meaningful choice and rural and underserved communities aren\u2019t left behind.
