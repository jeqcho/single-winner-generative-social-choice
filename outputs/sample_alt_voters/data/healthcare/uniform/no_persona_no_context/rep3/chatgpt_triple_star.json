    "The government should help ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing room for a mix of public and private options. Supporters of a larger public role can see this as a commitment to universal coverage and preventive care, and skeptics can support it if it emphasizes cost control, transparency, and patient choice. A practical middle ground is to set baseline guarantees and standards, fund coverage for those who can\u2019t afford it, and use regulated competition and accountable providers to drive quality and efficiency."
