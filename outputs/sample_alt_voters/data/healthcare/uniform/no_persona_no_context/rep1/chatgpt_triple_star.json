    "The government should ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare by setting baseline coverage standards and providing targeted subsidies or public options for those who would otherwise be left out. At the same time, it can preserve consumer choice and innovation by allowing a strong role for private insurers and providers, with transparent pricing and competition where markets function well. By focusing public resources on preventive care, catastrophic coverage, and protecting vulnerable groups, this approach balances individual responsibility with a shared commitment to health and financial security."
