That means setting clear national rules for basic benefits, pricing transparency, and consumer protections, and using targeted subsidies or automatic enrollment so coverage is universal. In return, payment should be tied to outcomes and cost-effectiveness, with flexibility for states and systems to meet the standards in different ways.",

A workable consensus role for government is to guarantee a universal baseline of essential coverage and strong patient protections, use targeted subsidies for those who can\u2019t afford care, and invest in prevention and public health. At the same time, government should set clear quality and transparency standards, curb abusive pricing, and reduce administrative waste while allowing a mix of public and private delivery models so innovation and choice can continue. Progress should be judged by measurable outcomes\u2014access, health results, and total costs\u2014so different approaches can be compared and improved.",
