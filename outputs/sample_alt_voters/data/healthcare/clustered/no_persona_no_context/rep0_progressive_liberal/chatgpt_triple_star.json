    "The government should ensure that everyone can access essential, affordable healthcare by setting clear standards, providing support for those who can\u2019t pay, and preventing discrimination based on health status. At the same time, it can preserve choice and innovation by allowing a mix of public and private options and encouraging competition where it lowers costs and improves quality. In this middle-ground approach, the public role focuses on universal access, transparency, and accountability, while patients and providers retain flexibility in how care is delivered."
