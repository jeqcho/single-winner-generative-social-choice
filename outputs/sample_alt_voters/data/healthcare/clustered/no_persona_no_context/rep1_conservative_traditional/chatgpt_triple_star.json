    "Government should ensure that everyone has access to affordable, essential healthcare while allowing flexibility in how coverage is delivered. This can be achieved by setting clear national standards, protecting patients from catastrophic costs, and funding care for those who would otherwise go without, while still encouraging competition, innovation, and choice among public and private options. By focusing on outcomes\u2014coverage, quality, and cost control\u2014rather than a single model, policymakers can respect different preferences while meeting a shared commitment to basic care for all."
