    "The government should help guarantee that everyone can access essential healthcare, while leaving room for a mix of public and private options to encourage innovation and choice. It can set baseline standards, protect people from catastrophic costs, and fill gaps where markets don\u2019t reach, while holding providers and insurers accountable for quality and efficiency. This approach respects concerns about affordability and equity as well as worries about excessive bureaucracy and reduced competition."
