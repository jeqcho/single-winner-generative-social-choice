    "The government should help ensure that everyone can access essential healthcare, while allowing room for a mix of public and private delivery models. This can be done by setting baseline coverage standards, protecting people from catastrophic costs, and using transparent funding and oversight to improve quality and control spending. At the same time, policy should preserve patient choice and encourage innovation and efficiency through competition and accountable providers."
