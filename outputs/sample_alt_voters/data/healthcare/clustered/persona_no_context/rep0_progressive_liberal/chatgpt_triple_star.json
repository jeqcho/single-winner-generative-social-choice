    "Governments should ensure that every person has access to essential, affordable healthcare by setting and enforcing basic standards, expanding coverage options, and supporting safety-net programs while preserving space for private innovation and choice. By combining public funding for core services, targeted subsidies for those who need them, and regulation to protect quality and competition, policymakers can balance fiscal responsibility with the moral imperative to prevent untreated illness and financial ruin. This approach acknowledges differing views on the size and role of government but focuses on shared goals: broad access, cost control, and high-quality care for all."
