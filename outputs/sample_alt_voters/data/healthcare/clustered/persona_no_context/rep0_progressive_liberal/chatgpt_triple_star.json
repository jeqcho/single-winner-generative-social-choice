    "The government should ensure that every person has access to essential healthcare by setting clear coverage standards and providing a reliable safety net, while allowing flexibility in how care is delivered through a mix of public and private options. This approach respects concerns about cost, choice, and innovation by emphasizing competition, transparency, and outcomes-based oversight. At the same time, it addresses equity and public health goals by guaranteeing no one is denied basic care due to income or preexisting conditions."
