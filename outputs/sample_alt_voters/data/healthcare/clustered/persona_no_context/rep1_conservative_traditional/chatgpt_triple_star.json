    "The government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, quality healthcare by setting basic standards, providing support for the most vulnerable, and creating a transparent system that encourages innovation and choice. While allowing private providers and insurers to operate and compete, the government should fund safety nets, regulate for fairness and outcomes, and partner with states and communities to expand coverage and control costs in ways that respect individual preferences and fiscal responsibility."
