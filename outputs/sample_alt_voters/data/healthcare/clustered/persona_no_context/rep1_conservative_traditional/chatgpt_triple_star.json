    "The government should help guarantee that everyone can access essential, high-quality healthcare without facing financial ruin, while leaving room for private providers and patient choice. This can be achieved by setting clear coverage standards, protecting people with preexisting conditions, and using public funding and regulation to make care affordable and available. At the same time, policymakers should emphasize transparency, competition where it improves value, and strong cost controls and anti-fraud measures so the system remains sustainable for taxpayers."
