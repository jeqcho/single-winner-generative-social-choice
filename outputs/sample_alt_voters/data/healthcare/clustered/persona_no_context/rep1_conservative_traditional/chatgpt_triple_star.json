    "The government should ensure that every person has access to basic, affordable healthcare by setting and enforcing standards, providing subsidies or a safety net for those who cannot afford care, and regulating the market to promote transparency and competition. At the same time, it should partner with private providers and insurers, preserve space for innovation and choice, and focus public resources on cost control, preventive care, and equity to balance efficiency with broad coverage."
