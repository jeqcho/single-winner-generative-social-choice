    "The government should help ensure that everyone has access to essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing flexibility in how coverage is delivered through a mix of public programs and regulated private options. This approach recognizes concerns about cost, choice, and innovation, while also acknowledging that leaving access entirely to the market can result in gaps that harm individuals and communities. A practical middle ground is for government to set clear standards, provide subsidies or public coverage for those who need it, and promote competition and transparency to control costs and improve quality."
