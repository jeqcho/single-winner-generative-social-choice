    "The government should set a clear national goal that everyone can access essential, affordable healthcare, while allowing a mix of public programs and regulated private options to reflect different preferences. It can focus on common priorities like preventing medical bankruptcy, improving transparency and competition where possible, and investing in public health and primary care to lower costs over time. At the same time, reforms should protect patient choice and encourage innovation, with accountability measures to ensure funds are spent efficiently and outcomes improve."
