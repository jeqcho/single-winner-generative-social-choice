A broad middle-ground reform is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district), require electors to follow their state\u2019s certified results, and set clear national baselines for voter access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races. If consensus grows over time, a national popular-vote outcome\u2014through a constitutional amendment or a carefully designed interstate compact\u2014could be a next step, ideally paired with a voting method that reduces spoiler fears and rewards candidates who build cross-regional coalitions.",
