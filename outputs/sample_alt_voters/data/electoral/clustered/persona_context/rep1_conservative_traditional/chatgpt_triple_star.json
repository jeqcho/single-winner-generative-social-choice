    "Many Americans value the Electoral College for encouraging broad, statewide coalitions, while others want every vote to carry equal weight nationally. A reasonable middle ground is to keep the constitutional structure but reduce distortions by adopting reforms such as a uniform national standard for allocating electors more proportionally or by district, combined with stronger voting access and election security measures. These steps would preserve the federal role of states while moving outcomes closer to the popular vote and improving confidence in the system."
