A broadly acceptable step is to replace statewide winner-take-all with an automatic, near-proportional allocation (with a small statewide bonus only when a candidate clears a clear threshold), while requiring electors to be bound to the certified outcome. Pair this with national minimum standards for voter access, paper-backed tabulation, routine risk-limiting audits, and uniform recount and certification deadlines so close elections are resolved consistently. If trust and bipartisan support grow, the country can then consider a constitutional amendment or a carefully safeguarded popular-vote compact as a final, transparent step.",

If broad, durable support develops, a transparent pathway such as the National Popular Vote compact or a constitutional amendment can further align results with the national popular will while preserving stability and public trust.",
