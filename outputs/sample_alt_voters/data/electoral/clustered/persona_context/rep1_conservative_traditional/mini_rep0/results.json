Any changes should be phased in with clear transparency requirements so rural and urban voters alike see their ballots matter and trust close results.",

Implemented transparently with broad oversight, these steps can increase legitimacy, expand campaigning beyond a handful of swing states, and protect smaller and rural communities\u2019 voice.",
