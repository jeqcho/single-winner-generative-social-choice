States could allocate electors using a consistent proportional formula (with a small threshold to avoid extreme fragmentation) and bind electors to the certified result, while Congress sets minimum national rules for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and uniform recount triggers. This preserves regional voice and administrative federalism while making campaigns less obsessed with a few battlegrounds and making outcomes easier for the public to see as fair.",
