A workable package is to replace winner-take-all with a uniform allocation rule that uses the same method in every state (such as proportional allocation with a minimum threshold), bind electors to the certified results, and adopt clear national baselines for ballot access, secure paper records, audits, and automatic recounts. If experience shows the system is still diverging from the popular vote or fueling distrust, a phased path like a widely adopted popular-vote compact or a constitutional update can be considered with strong, bipartisan implementation rules.",

A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or optionally district-based) allocation of electors in every state, and to bind electors to the certified result. Any reform should include clear national baseline standards for ballot access and security, transparent audits, and automatic recount triggers so close elections are settled by consistent rules that people across urban, suburban, and rural communities can trust.",

A workable reform package is to keep the Electoral College but replace winner-take-all with proportional allocation in every state, require electors to follow the certified results, and set clear national baseline rules for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races. If the country later wants a bigger change, a broadly adopted National Popular Vote compact (paired with reforms that reduce \u201cspoiler\u201d fears, such as ranked-choice voting) can further align the winner with the popular will without destabilizing election administration.",
