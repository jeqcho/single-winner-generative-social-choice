To improve legitimacy for voters of all ages and backgrounds, electors should be bound to certified results and paired with uniform national baselines for ballot access, paper-backed auditing, and automatic recount triggers in very close races. If the country later chooses a national popular-vote outcome, it should be pursued transparently (via the National Popular Vote compact or amendment) with clear safeguards so no region feels ignored and close elections remain manageable.",
