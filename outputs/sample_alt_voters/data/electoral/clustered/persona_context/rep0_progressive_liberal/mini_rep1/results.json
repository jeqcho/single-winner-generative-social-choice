States could award electors proportionally based on statewide results, with electors legally bound to the certified vote, and Congress could set a narrow set of uniform rules for transparent counting, auditable paper records, and automatic recount thresholds. If the country later wants a stronger popular-vote guarantee, a broadly adopted interstate compact could serve as a tested backstop without requiring an immediate constitutional amendment.",

A practical consensus reform is to end winner-take-all by allocating electoral votes proportionally in every state, bind electors to the certified result, and adopt clear national baselines for ballot access, auditable counting, and automatic recount triggers in close races. If broader buy-in develops, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a phased backstop to align outcomes with the national popular vote without a sudden constitutional overhaul.",

A practical middle step is to end winner-take-all by allocating each state\u2019s electors proportionally and binding electors to the certified results, paired with clear national baselines for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races. If broad public buy-in develops, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a phased path toward a clearer popular mandate, while ranked-choice voting or a runoff option can reduce spoiler fears and encourage coalition-building.",
