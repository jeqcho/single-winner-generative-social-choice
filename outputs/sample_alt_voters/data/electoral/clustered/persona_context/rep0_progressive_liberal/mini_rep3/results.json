If a broader shift to a national popular vote gains durable support, it should include a majority requirement (ranked\u2011choice or a runoff) and the same integrity standards so legitimacy is strengthened rather than traded away.",

If broader agreement develops, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting or an automatic runoff\u2014can be a phased path toward a popular-vote outcome with a clear majority mandate.",

A practical reform is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (with a small, reasonable threshold), binding electors to the certified result, and setting uniform national baselines for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races.
