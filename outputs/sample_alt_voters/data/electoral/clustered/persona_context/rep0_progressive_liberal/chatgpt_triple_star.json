    "A constructive path forward is to preserve the Electoral College\u2019s role in ensuring broad, geographically diverse support while updating it to better reflect voters\u2019 choices and strengthen confidence in outcomes. Reforms such as a uniform national standard for ballot access and recounts, expanding the House to better align electors with population, and encouraging states to allocate electors proportionally (or through an interstate compact that takes effect only with broad bipartisan buy-in) could reduce disparities without discarding federalism. This approach respects concerns about small-state influence and regional balance while addressing worries about fairness, legitimacy, and the winner losing the popular vote."
