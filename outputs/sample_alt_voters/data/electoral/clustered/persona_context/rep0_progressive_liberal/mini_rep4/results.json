A practical step is to curb winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional elector allocation (or, where states choose, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once there is broad buy-in), paired with firm rules binding electors to the certified vote. If additional legitimacy is needed, a simple runoff or ranked-choice option can reduce spoiler fears and encourage candidates to build support across urban, rural, and small-state communities.",
