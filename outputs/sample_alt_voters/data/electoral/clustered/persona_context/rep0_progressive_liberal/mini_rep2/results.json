A workable middle path is to require every state to allocate electors proportionally based on the statewide vote (with a small threshold to avoid extreme fragmentation) and to bind electors to the certified result. At the same time, Congress should set uniform, plain-language rules for ballot access, recount triggers, audit standards, and certification deadlines so close elections are resolved consistently and with less litigation.",

Pair this with clear nationwide baseline standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers so close elections are transparent, consistent, and less prone to courtroom chaos. If broader change gains durable support, allow a phased path toward a national popular-vote guarantee (e.g., via the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact) with simple, uniform rules to protect stability and legitimacy.",

A practical middle path is for states to end winner-take-all and allocate electors proportionally (with firm rules against faithless electors), while adopting clear, nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers so results are timely and trusted. If the country later wants a stronger popular-vote guarantee, it should be phased in through a broadly accepted mechanism like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or an amendment, with simple guardrails such as ranked-choice voting or an automatic runoff to ensure majority support and reduce spoiler fears.",
