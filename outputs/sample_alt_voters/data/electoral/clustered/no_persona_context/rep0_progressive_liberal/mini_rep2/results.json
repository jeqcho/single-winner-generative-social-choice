Keep the Electoral College but adopt a national rule that electors are allocated by a consistent, non-winner-take-all method (with a modest statewide bonus or majority threshold to preserve coalition-building), and require electors to follow the certified result. Pair that with uniform federal baselines for voter access, paper-backed audits, recount triggers, and certification timelines so close elections are handled predictably. After several cycles, voters could decide\u2014through a clear, pre-set process\u2014whether to keep this modernized system or move to a direct popular-vote model with a runoff/RCV for majority legitimacy.",

A practical middle ground is to keep state-run elections but replace winner-take-all with proportional (or district-based with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) allocation of electors, require electors to follow the certified result, and adopt uniform national baselines for ballot access, audits, recount thresholds, and certification deadlines. If these steps build trust and reduce close-election chaos, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with a majority safeguard like ranked-choice or an automatic runoff\u2014can remain an optional, phased path toward a clearer national mandate.",

To reduce close-election chaos and suspicion, Congress should set nationwide baseline rules for ballot access, transparent auditing, uniform certification deadlines, and automatic recount thresholds, while leaving states room to administer elections above that floor. If these steps prove workable and widely accepted, the country could then consider a phased national popular-vote option\u2014such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact paired with ranked-choice or an automatic runoff\u2014to ensure majority legitimacy without a sudden overhaul.",
