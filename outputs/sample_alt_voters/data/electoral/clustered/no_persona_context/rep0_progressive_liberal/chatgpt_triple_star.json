    "While some view the Electoral College as an important federal safeguard and others see it as an outdated barrier to equal representation, there is room for reforms that preserve stability while improving fairness and trust. A balanced approach could keep a state-based presidential election but require results to more closely track the national popular vote\u2014through a uniform allocation method, stronger standards for election administration, and clear rules to prevent faithless electors and resolve close contests. This would maintain the role of states while reducing distortions, increasing transparency, and ensuring every voter\u2019s ballot carries more comparable weight."
