To reduce remaining distortions, expand the House to better match population, and if broad agreement emerges later, transition through a clear interstate compact or amendment toward a national popular-vote outcome with a runoff or ranked-choice mechanism.",

To reduce current distortions without scrapping the system, expand the House to better match population, and allow a future, clearly defined transition\u2014such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or a constitutional amendment\u2014only if broad buy-in exists and a runoff/RCV method is in place to ensure majority support.",
