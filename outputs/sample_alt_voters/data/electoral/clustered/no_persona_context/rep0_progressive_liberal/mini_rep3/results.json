Electors should be legally bound to certified results, with clear enforcement, so close elections are decided by transparent rules rather than ad hoc disputes.",

Replace winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally in every state (with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards if districts are used), so campaigns have incentives to compete in more communities instead of only a few swing states.
