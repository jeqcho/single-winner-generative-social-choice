Complementary steps\u2014binding electors to certified results and, where feasible, ranked-choice voting\u2014can encourage broader coalition-building and reduce swing-state-only campaigning without erasing regional voices.",

A practical path is to encourage states to allocate electors proportionally (or through a carefully designed district-plus-at-large model) while setting clear national baseline rules for voter access, secure paper ballots, transparent audits, and automatic recounts in very close races, and requiring electors to follow certified results. After those safeguards are proven and broadly accepted, states could choose to join an interstate compact that reflects the national popular vote without rushing into a destabilizing overhaul.",
