If these steps rebuild trust and campaigning broadens beyond a few battlegrounds, a national popular-vote guarantee via compact or amendment can be considered only with the same transparent safeguards to avoid coast-to-coast recount chaos.",

To address representation concerns without centralizing election administration, consider expanding the House to reduce distortions; if a national popular-vote guarantee is pursued later (via compact or amendment), it should include the same uniform safeguards to prevent a single, nationwide recount.",
