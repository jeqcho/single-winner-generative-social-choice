To address concerns about legitimacy and close national outcomes, Congress could pair this with clear, enforceable rules binding electors to certified results and a narrowly tailored fallback\u2014such as a contingent national popular-vote tiebreaker or compact trigger\u2014activated only when agreed safeguards are met. Phasing the changes in over multiple cycles and using independent redistricting where districts matter would reduce partisan gamesmanship while giving campaigns incentives to compete beyond a handful of swing areas.",
