    "While views differ between keeping the Electoral College to protect federalism and smaller states versus moving to a system where every vote counts equally, most people agree the presidency should reflect broad national support and be chosen through a transparent, trusted process. A practical middle ground is to retain the state-based framework but adopt reforms\u2014such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, along with uniform voting standards\u2014that reduce the chances of a popular-vote/electoral-vote mismatch and incentivize candidates to compete nationwide. These changes can preserve constitutional continuity while better aligning outcomes with democratic expectations and strengthening confidence in elections."
