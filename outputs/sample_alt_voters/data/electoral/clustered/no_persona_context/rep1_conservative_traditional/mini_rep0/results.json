Any shift should be paired with enforceable national baselines for voter access, timely counting, paper-backed ballots, audits, and uniform recount triggers, plus binding rules to prevent faithless electors. If states prefer a national popular-vote approach, an interstate compact could activate only after these standards are adopted and reviewed, so legitimacy and small-state confidence are strengthened rather than traded away.",

In parallel, set clear national baseline standards for ballot access, auditable paper records, post\u2011election audits, and consistent recount triggers to strengthen trust and legitimacy. Once these safeguards are widely in place, allow states to opt into a National Popular Vote interstate compact or similar mechanism so outcomes track the national popular will more closely while preserving meaningful state roles.",

Pair this with national minimum standards for voter ID/verification options, timely counting, paper-ballot backups, and routine post-election audits and recount triggers to strengthen confidence in close outcomes. Require electors to follow certified state results and allow any national popular-vote compact or further changes only after broad, bipartisan agreement on these safeguards.",
