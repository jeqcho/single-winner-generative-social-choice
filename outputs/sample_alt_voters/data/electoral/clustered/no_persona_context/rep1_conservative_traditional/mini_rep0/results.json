Standardize a minimum set of national rules for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts, then require states to award electors in a way that reflects statewide vote shares more closely and eliminates incentives to manipulate district lines, while binding electors to the certified outcome. To address smaller-state concerns without preserving winner-take-all distortions, Congress could expand the House (reducing the Senate-bonus effect) and set a clear timetable for evaluating a national popular-vote option only after the new rules prove stable and broadly trusted.",

Allocate electors proportionally (or by district with anti-gerrymandering guardrails), require electors to follow the certified state result, and adopt clear national baselines for ballot access, tabulation, audits, and automatic recount triggers. If these reforms build trust and there is broad agreement, a carefully designed national popular-vote compact or amendment\u2014with the same uniform safeguards\u2014can be considered as a later backstop.",
