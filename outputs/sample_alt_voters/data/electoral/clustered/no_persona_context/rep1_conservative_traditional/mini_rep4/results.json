Electors should be legally bound to the certified state result, with a single national floor for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and clear automatic recount and certification rules to reduce post\u2011election litigation. If these steps build trust and stability, an interstate compact or amendment that guarantees a clear popular mandate can be considered as a later backstop rather than a rushed first move.",

A practical compromise is to keep state-run elections and the Electoral College, but require electors to be bound to the certified result, replace winner-take-all with proportional allocation (with clear anti-gerrymandering guardrails if districts are used), and set national baseline standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers. After those rules are in place and trusted, the country could consider a carefully designed National Popular Vote approach (or amendment) as a backstop, with safeguards to prevent chaotic, coast-to-coast recounts.",
