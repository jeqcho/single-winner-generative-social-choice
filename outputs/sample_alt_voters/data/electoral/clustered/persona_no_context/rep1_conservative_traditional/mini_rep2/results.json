A strong middle-ground reform is to reduce winner-take-all incentives by allocating electors proportionally or by district with limited at-large electors, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and a clear national recount process. Reforms should also require electors to follow certified results and strengthen transparency so close elections are easier to verify and accept.
