A workable compromise is to curb winner-take-all by requiring states to allocate electors in a clearly proportional way (with a small statewide bonus only if desired) and to add ranked-choice ballots so the winner reflects broad support. Whatever model is chosen, it should be paired with transparent, auditable national minimum standards for ballot access, counting, and recounts so people in every community can trust the result.",

A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College but reduce winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, paired with clear nationwide minimum standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts. If the country later moves to a national popular vote, it should include safeguards like ranked-choice voting and transparent, bipartisan implementation so the system stays stable, simple to understand, and trusted by rural and urban voters alike.",
