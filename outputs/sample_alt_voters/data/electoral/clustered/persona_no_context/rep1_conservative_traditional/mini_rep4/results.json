To build confidence across parties, pair any change with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts, and require electors to follow the certified results to prevent faithless-elector surprises.

This keeps elections state-run and stable, but makes outcomes easier to trust because they track the public\u2019s vote more closely and treat voters in every state as worth competing for.",
