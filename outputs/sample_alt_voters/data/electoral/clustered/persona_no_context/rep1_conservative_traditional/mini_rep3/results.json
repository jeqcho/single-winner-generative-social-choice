If those steps don\u2019t resolve legitimacy concerns, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact could serve as a next-step option once participating states meet transparent, uniform election-administration standards.",

States should adopt proportional (or otherwise less winner-take-all) allocation of electors, require electors to follow the certified vote, and use clear national baseline standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be considered once transparent safeguards and uniform rules are in place.

Any change should come with uniform baseline rules for voter ID/eligibility verification, ballot access, timely counting, recount triggers, and transparent audits so every lawful vote is treated consistently and outcomes are trusted. If broader agreement develops over time, the National Popular Vote compact can be evaluated with strong safeguards to protect close-election legitimacy and state administration.",
