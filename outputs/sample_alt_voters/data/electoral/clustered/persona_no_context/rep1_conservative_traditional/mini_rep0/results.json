At the same time, Congress and the states should agree on baseline national standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recounts in very close contests so outcomes are transparent and harder to dispute. This approach preserves a meaningful state role and geographic legitimacy while reducing the sense that a handful of swing-state margins decide everything.",

A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or by congressional district (with statewide electors), require electors to follow the state\u2019s certified vote, and adopt uniform national standards for ballot access, recount triggers, audits, and transparent certification. These updates would reduce \u201cswing state\u201d distortion, strengthen election integrity and legitimacy, and make every lawful vote matter without a wholesale constitutional rewrite.",

States could be encouraged (or required) to award electors proportionally or by district with clear guardrails, while adopting uniform national standards for ballot access, voter verification, paper-backed audits, and automatic recounts in very close races. These changes would reduce winner-take-all distortions and \u201cswing state\u201d overfocus, strengthen security and transparency, and still preserve a meaningful voice for smaller and rural communities.",
