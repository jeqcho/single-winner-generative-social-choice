States could be encouraged to allocate electors proportionally (with a small bonus for the statewide winner) and to bind electors to the certified result, so outcomes track public support without erasing regional balance. Alongside that, shared national baselines for ballot access, paper records, audits, and recount timelines would improve transparency and trust no matter which party wins.",

A practical compromise is to keep the state-based system but reduce winner-take-all by awarding electors by congressional district or proportionally, and to require electors to follow their state\u2019s certified result. Pair that with uniform baseline standards for ballot access, recounts, and transparent audits so outcomes are easier to trust and less likely to hinge on razor-thin disputes in a few states.",

A workable compromise is to require electors to follow the state\u2019s certified results, adopt uniform national baselines for ballot access, audits, and recount timelines, and encourage states to allocate electors proportionally (or by district with independent redistricting) to better match close outcomes. If a national popular-vote approach is pursued through an interstate compact, it should include clear, bipartisan safeguards and only take effect once it reaches a broad, stable threshold, so the rules are trusted and consistent.",
