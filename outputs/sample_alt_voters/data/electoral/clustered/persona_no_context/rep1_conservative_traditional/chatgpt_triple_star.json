    "While preserving the goal of balancing state and popular interests in presidential elections, we should reform the Electoral College to increase fairness and public confidence by encouraging broader representation\u2014for example, by adopting a national popular vote compact or proportionally allocating electors\u2014while retaining protections for smaller states through safeguards like minimum elector thresholds. Any changes should be implemented through clear legal processes, include bipartisan input, and aim to enhance voter engagement and legitimacy without abruptly discarding the federal character of the system."
