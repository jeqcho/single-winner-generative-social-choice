    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and ensure broad geographic support, others argue it should be changed to better reflect the national popular will. A practical middle ground is to retain the system\u2019s state-based framework but reduce distortions by adopting reforms such as ranked-choice voting or proportional allocation of electors within states, expanding the House to better align representation, and setting consistent national standards for election administration. These steps would maintain the role of states while making outcomes more representative, transparent, and trusted across the political spectrum."
