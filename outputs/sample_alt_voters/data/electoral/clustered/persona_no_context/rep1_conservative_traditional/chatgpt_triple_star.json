    "Recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the popular will while also valuing the role of states in the federal system, we should pursue measured reforms that increase democratic representation without upending federalism. Practical steps could include adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or adjusting allocation methods to better reflect statewide vote totals, paired with safeguards to ensure smaller states retain meaningful influence and that any change is implemented through constitutional or multi-state agreements rather than abrupt unilateral moves."
