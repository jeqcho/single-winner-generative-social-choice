    "While some Americans favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and protect smaller states, others want reform to better reflect the national popular will and boost confidence in election outcomes. A practical middle ground is to retain the state-based system but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with stronger national standards for voting access, recounts, and election security. If these reforms fail to improve legitimacy and competitiveness, a structured, bipartisan review process could consider a phased transition toward a popular-vote-based alternative with safeguards for minority and regional interests."
