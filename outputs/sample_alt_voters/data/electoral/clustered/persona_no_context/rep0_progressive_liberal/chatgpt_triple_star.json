    "While acknowledging concerns that the Electoral College can both amplify small-state voices and distort the popular will, a pragmatic reform path would preserve federalism by keeping state-based electors while ensuring that the overall outcome better reflects the national popular vote\u2014for example through interstate compacts or proportional allocation of electors. Such changes would respect the constitutional role of states, encourage candidates to campaign more broadly, and reduce the winner-take-all distortions that leave many voters feeling disenfranchised."
