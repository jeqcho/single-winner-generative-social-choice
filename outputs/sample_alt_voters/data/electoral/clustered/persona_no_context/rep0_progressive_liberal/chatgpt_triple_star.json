    "Recognizing the importance of both fair representation and the stability of presidential elections, we should pursue modest, bipartisan reforms that preserve state roles while reducing distortions in vote influence\u2014such as adopting the National Popular Vote compact or awarding electoral votes proportionally in states that choose to do so. These measures respect federalism and state choice, acknowledge concerns about majority rule and small-state protections, and can be phased in or reversed by states if unintended consequences arise."
