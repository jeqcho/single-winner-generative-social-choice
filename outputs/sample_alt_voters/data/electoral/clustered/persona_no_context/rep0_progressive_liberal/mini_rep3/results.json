A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College but require states to allocate electors proportionally (or through a consistent district method), paired with clear national standards for voter access, transparent counting, paper-audit trails, and uniform recount rules. If broader agreement develops, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact could be a next step once these safeguards are in place.
