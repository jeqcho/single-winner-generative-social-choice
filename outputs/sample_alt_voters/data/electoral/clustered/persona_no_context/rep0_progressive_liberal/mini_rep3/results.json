A viable path is a mix of measures states can adopt: proportional or district-based elector allocation, incentives for joining a National Popular Vote agreement once uniform access and auditing standards are in place, and wider use of ranked-choice ballots to ensure majority support. Complementing these reforms with national minimum standards for registration, ballot access, and transparent recount procedures would protect smaller communities without leaving outcomes decided by a few swing areas. The goal should be durable, easy-to-understand rules that encourage broad campaigning, reduce polarization, and make results widely accepted across regions and parties.",
