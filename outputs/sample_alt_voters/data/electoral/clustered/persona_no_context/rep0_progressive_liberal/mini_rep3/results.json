States could adopt a uniform proportional allocation method (with a small, common threshold) and Congress could pair it with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, recount triggers, and certification timelines to prevent chaos in close races. To strengthen majority legitimacy, states could also use ranked-choice voting for president so the eventual winner reflects broad support rather than a narrow plurality concentrated in a few battlegrounds.",

A strong bridge is to move toward a national popular-vote outcome (via the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or a constitutional amendment) or, if the Electoral College remains, require proportional allocation of electors to reduce winner-take-all distortions and swing-state dominance. Either path should be paired with clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, vote counting, audits, recounts, and limits on faithless electors so results are transparent, timely, and broadly accepted. The goal is stability and legitimacy: campaigns that build broad coalitions across urban, suburban, and rural communities, not strategies that ignore most voters.",
