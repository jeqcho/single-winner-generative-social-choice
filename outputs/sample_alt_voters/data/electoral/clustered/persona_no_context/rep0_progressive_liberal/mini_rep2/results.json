If the country later moves to a national popular vote, it should include a clear legitimacy safeguard such as a ranked-choice national ballot or a runoff threshold so winners reflect broad support. The test of any change should be simple: every voter can participate, every ballot is handled consistently, and the outcome is widely seen as fair and stable.",
