In parallel, adopt clear national baseline standards for ballot access, secure counting, and automatic recount triggers in very close races, so outcomes are transparent and consistently administered across languages and communities. If broader change is desired, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be used as a phased, testable path toward aligning the presidency with the national popular will without abrupt constitutional disruption.",
