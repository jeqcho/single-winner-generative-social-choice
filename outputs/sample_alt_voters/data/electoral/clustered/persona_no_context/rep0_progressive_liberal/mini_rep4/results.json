Pair that with uniform baseline rules for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races, so outcomes are easier to verify and harder to dispute across states.",

A practical bridge is for more states to adopt proportional (or district-based) allocation and to bind electors to their state\u2019s certified results, while also enabling a National Popular Vote compact once enough states join. Whatever path is chosen, confidence depends on clear, uniform baseline rules for ballot access, recount triggers, audits, and transparent certification so every lawful vote is treated consistently and the result is easy to trust.",

Pair any change with clear, uniform national baselines for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers, while leaving day-to-day administration to states.
