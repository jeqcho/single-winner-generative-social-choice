That approach lets people compare bigger options\u2014like the National Popular Vote compact or a constitutional amendment\u2014against shared measures of fairness, regional incentives, and stability rather than partisan advantage.",

A workable middle path is to reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions while keeping states central\u2014such as encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation and/or joining an interstate popular-vote agreement\u2014with clear safeguards for close elections (uniform counting standards, automatic recount triggers, and transparent certification).
