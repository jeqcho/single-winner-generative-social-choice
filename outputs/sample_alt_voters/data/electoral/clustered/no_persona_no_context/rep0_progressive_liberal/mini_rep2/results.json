A practical compromise is to keep states involved but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation and adding ranked-choice voting options so winners reflect broader support. Alongside any structural change (including the National Popular Vote compact), we can agree on uniform baseline standards for access, counting, recount triggers, and transparent certification so close elections are resolved consistently and peacefully.",
