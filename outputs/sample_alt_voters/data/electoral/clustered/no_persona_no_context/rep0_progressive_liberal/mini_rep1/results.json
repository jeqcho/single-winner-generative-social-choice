If those steps still leave persistent popular-vote mismatches, an interstate compact or constitutional amendment could be considered with clear thresholds and transition rules to protect stability.",

A practical compromise is to keep the constitutional framework but curb winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or by district with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards, alongside clear national standards for access, counting, audits, and certification. We can also evaluate a carefully designed popular-vote mechanism (such as an interstate compact with uniform recount thresholds and transition rules) against shared goals of legitimacy, regional coalition-building, and public trust.",

A workable middle path is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with strong anti-gerrymandering protections), paired with clear national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers. We can also add a backstop\u2014such as a national popular-vote compact or automatic runoff/RCV in close races\u2014so the final outcome tracks voter preference while preserving stability and regional balance.",
