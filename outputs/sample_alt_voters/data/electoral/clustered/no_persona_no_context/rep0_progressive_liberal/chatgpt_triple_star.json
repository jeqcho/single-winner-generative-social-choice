    "Many people value the Electoral College for preserving federalism and encouraging coalition-building across states, while others see it as failing to reflect the national popular will and creating unequal influence among voters. A workable middle ground is to keep the state-based framework but reform it to better align outcomes with voter intent\u2014such as adopting a proportional or district-based allocation of electors, combined with nationwide standards for ballot access, election administration, and recounts. These changes would preserve states\u2019 roles while reducing winner-take-all distortions and increasing confidence that every vote meaningfully contributes to the result."
