A workable middle path is to keep state-run elections but reduce winner-take-all by allocating electors based on statewide vote share (with a small threshold to avoid fringe spoilers), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, and recount triggers. If repeated mismatches between the popular vote and the result persist, a backstop like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or a national runoff could be evaluated using clear, pre-set criteria rather than partisan expectations.",

A practical bridge is to reduce winner-take-all distortions\u2014through proportional or district-based elector allocation (with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) and optional ranked-choice voting within states\u2014while strengthening baseline national standards for voting access, audits, and recounts. We can compare options like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact alongside these reforms using shared criteria: representation of states and regions, equal treatment of voters, and stability under tight margins.",

Alongside that, we can evaluate a national popular-vote option (such as an interstate compact) with safeguards and trigger rules for tight margins, so the winner reflects broad support without leaving smaller or rural communities feeling ignored.",
