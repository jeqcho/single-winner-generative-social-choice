A workable middle path is to keep state-run elections and the Electoral College framework, but require each state to award electors in a way that reflects its actual vote (proportional or a statewide ranked-choice tally) and pair that with uniform baseline standards for ballots, recount triggers, and certification timelines. That would reduce winner-take-all distortions and battleground-state dominance while preserving a federal role and making close outcomes easier to resolve and trust.",

A practical bridge is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by moving toward proportional or district-based elector allocation (optionally using ranked-choice voting within states) while setting clear national standards for voting access, counting, audits, and recounts. We can then evaluate these reforms by shared yardsticks\u2014representation for smaller states and regions, alignment with voter preferences, and public trust\u2014before deciding whether bigger structural changes are needed.",

A practical middle path is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation (with anti-gerrymandering protections) and, at the same time, adopt baseline national standards for access, security, audits, and recounts. If we test reforms by whether they broaden campaign attention beyond a few swing states while keeping elections understandable and stable, we can improve fairness without forcing an immediate all-or-nothing choice.",
