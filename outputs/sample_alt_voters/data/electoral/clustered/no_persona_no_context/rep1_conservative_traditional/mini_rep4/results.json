A practical bridge is to keep the state-based structure but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation paired with strong anti-gerrymandering protections, and to adopt uniform national standards for recounts, audits, and election administration. We can also test incremental steps\u2014like expanding the House or a popular-vote pathway such as the National Popular Vote compact\u2014against shared criteria of fairness, stability, and broad consent rather than party advantage.",

A practical middle path is to keep the state-based system but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation paired with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards. At the same time, set uniform national standards for voter access, audits, and recount triggers so outcomes are trusted no matter which party wins. These steps improve fairness and confidence without forcing an immediate all-or-nothing choice between abolition and the status quo.",
