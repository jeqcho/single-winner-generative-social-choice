A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College but reduce its distortions by awarding at least some electors based on statewide vote share (rather than all-or-nothing), paired with clear, uniform rules for certification, audits, and recount triggers. That approach aims to make more votes matter in every state while preserving incentives for candidates to build geographically broad support.",

A practical middle path is to keep the Electoral College but reduce winner-take-all distortions\u2014through proportional (or well-designed district-based) allocation of electors paired with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards. Alongside that, set clear national standards for ballot access, counting, and recounts so close elections don\u2019t hinge on arbitrary state rules. These reforms can preserve state-based coalition-building while making outcomes track more closely with the overall vote and improving public trust.",

A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions (through proportional or ranked-choice allocation within states) while adopting uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, and recounts. We can compare options using shared, nonpartisan criteria\u2014legitimacy, attention to all regions, and manageable administration\u2014so reforms strengthen confidence without turning the system into a partisan weapon.",
