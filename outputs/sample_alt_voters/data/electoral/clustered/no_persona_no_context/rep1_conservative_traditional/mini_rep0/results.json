A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional role of states but update incentives: add a uniform baseline for ballot access, counting, recount thresholds, and elector certification, while encouraging states to move away from winner-take-all through proportional or ranked-choice allocation. That approach preserves federalism and coalition-building while making outcomes better reflect voters and reducing the stakes of tiny margins in a few states.",

A practical middle path is to keep the state-based framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions through proportional (or carefully designed district-based) elector allocation paired with safeguards against gerrymandering. Alongside allocation changes, adopting clear national baseline standards for ballot access, counting, and certification can strengthen transparency and public confidence regardless of which reform path is chosen.",

A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation (with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) and adding clear, uniform national rules for ballot access, counting, and recounts.
