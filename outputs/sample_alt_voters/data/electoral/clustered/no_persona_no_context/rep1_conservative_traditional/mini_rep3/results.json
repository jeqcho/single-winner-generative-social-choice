A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework for now but reduce winner-take-all incentives by encouraging proportional elector allocation (or another method that better reflects the statewide vote), paired with uniform national standards for ballots, recounts, and audits to strengthen trust. In parallel, states could pilot ranked-choice voting for president and we can evaluate results against shared benchmarks\u2014legitimacy, stability, and broad participation\u2014before deciding whether bigger steps like the National Popular Vote compact or a constitutional amendment are warranted.",
