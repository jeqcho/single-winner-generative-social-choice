A practical middle path is to keep a state-based role but reduce winner-take-all distortions by allocating electors proportionally or by district with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards, while also standardizing national rules for ballots, recount triggers, and audits. In parallel, reforms like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be evaluated against clear benchmarks\u2014reducing \u201cwasted\u201d votes, reflecting voter intent, and preserving incentives for broad, geographically diverse coalitions.",

A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework but reduce winner-take-all incentives by encouraging proportional (or district-based with strong anti-gerrymandering rules) allocation of electors, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers.
