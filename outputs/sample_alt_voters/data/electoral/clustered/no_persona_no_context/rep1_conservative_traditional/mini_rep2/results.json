A practical compromise is to keep a state-based system but reduce winner-take-all distortions by moving toward proportional allocation of electors (or ranked-choice within states), while also adopting clear national standards for voter access, recounts, and certification. If states want to go further, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be evaluated alongside these steps using shared criteria\u2014legitimacy, stability in close elections, and constitutional durability\u2014rather than partisan advantage.",
