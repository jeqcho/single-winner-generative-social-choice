A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors and expanding the House to better match population, while also setting clear, uniform rules for voting access, counting, and recounts. We can also lock in safeguards like banning faithless electors and improving certification transparency so close elections are resolved consistently. These steps let people compare options on fairness, stability, and constitutional durability rather than partisan advantage.",
