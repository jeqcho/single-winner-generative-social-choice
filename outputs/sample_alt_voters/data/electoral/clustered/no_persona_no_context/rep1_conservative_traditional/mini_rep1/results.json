A bridging approach is to keep a state-based role while reducing winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional (or ranked-choice) allocation of electors within states and considering expanded representation (e.g., a larger House) to lessen built-in imbalances. In parallel, adopting clearer nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts can strengthen transparency and reduce razor-thin disputes regardless of which reform path is chosen.",
