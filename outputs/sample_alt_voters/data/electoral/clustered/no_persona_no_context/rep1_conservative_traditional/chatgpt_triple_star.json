    "While some Americans favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve a federal balance among states and others want a direct national popular vote, most agree the president should reflect the voters\u2019 will and that elections should be trusted, competitive, and clear. A pragmatic compromise is to retain a state-based system but reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions through reforms like proportional or district-based allocation of electors, a national popular-vote floor or threshold, and uniform rules that strengthen ballot access and counting. These changes would preserve the states\u2019 role while better aligning outcomes with nationwide voter preferences and improving legitimacy."
