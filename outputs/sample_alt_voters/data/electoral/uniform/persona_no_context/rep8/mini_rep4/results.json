A workable middle path is to keep the Electoral College but require proportional (or ranked-choice) allocation of electors in every state, paired with national baseline rules for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers so close elections are resolved consistently. That would reduce winner-take-all and swing-state incentives without demanding an immediate constitutional overhaul, and it can be phased in with broad bipartisan agreement to protect stability and legitimacy.",

A strong bridge is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) allocation of electors, paired with uniform nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts to strengthen trust. As an additional step once enough states agree, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact could serve as a transparent backstop so the candidate with the most votes reliably wins. Any change should be simple, predictable, and designed to reduce swing-state distortions and improve legitimacy across urban and rural areas alike.",
