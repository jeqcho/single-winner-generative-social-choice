A workable compromise is to end winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional elector allocation (or a proportional-plus threshold), while also adopting uniform baseline rules for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers to reduce disputes. Pairing these steps with enforceable limits on faithless electors and a commission-led, bipartisan implementation timeline can improve legitimacy without requiring an immediate constitutional overhaul.",

A practical bridge is moving toward a national popular vote via the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, with states also free to adopt proportional (or district-based) elector allocation to reduce winner-take-all \u201cswing state\u201d distortions. Any approach should be paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, recounts, and post-election audits, plus rules that bind electors to certified results, so outcomes are transparent, stable, and broadly trusted.",

A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College but require states to allocate electors proportionally (or by district with statewide balance), paired with ranked-choice voting options and clear, nationwide baseline standards for access, counting, audits, and recounts. Add protections to ensure electors follow certified results and reduce gerrymandering incentives, so outcomes are transparent, stable, and trusted by both urban and rural communities.",
