    "A constructive middle ground is to keep the Electoral College\u2019s role in balancing state and national interests while reducing outcomes that diverge sharply from the national popular vote. This could include expanding the House to better align electoral votes with population, adopting uniform minimum standards for election administration, and encouraging states to allocate electors by congressional district or through an interstate compact that takes effect only with broad, cross\u2011regional buy\u2011in. Such reforms preserve federalism and stability while increasing fairness, transparency, and voter confidence across the country."
