    "The Electoral College should be adjusted to better reflect the popular will while preserving federalism and the role of states in presidential elections; pragmatic reforms\u2014such as allocating electors by congressional district with two at-large electors, or adopting the National Popular Vote compact with safeguards for close contests\u2014could balance fairness and state interests. Any change should be enacted through a transparent, bipartisan process with clear rules for recounts and dispute resolution to maintain public trust and accommodate legitimate concerns about minority representation and regional influence."
