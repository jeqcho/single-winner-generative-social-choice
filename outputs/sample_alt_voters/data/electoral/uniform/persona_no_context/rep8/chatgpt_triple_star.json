    "The Electoral College should be reformed to better reflect the popular will while preserving federalism and the role of states, for example by adopting a national popular vote compact or modifying allocation rules to be more proportional. Such changes should be implemented through deliberate, transparent processes that respect constitutional constraints and seek bipartisan input, balancing concerns about small-state representation, regional interests, and democratic legitimacy."
