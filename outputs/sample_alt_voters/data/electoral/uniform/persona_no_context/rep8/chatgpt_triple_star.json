    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College should be preserved or replaced, many share a goal of ensuring presidential elections are both fair and broadly legitimate across the country. A workable middle ground is to keep the state-based structure but reduce winner-take-all distortions\u2014such as allocating electors proportionally or by congressional district\u2014while adopting national baseline standards for voting access and election administration. Coupling these changes with a trigger for a national popular vote if the Electoral College winner loses the national vote by a significant margin could balance state influence with the principle of one person, one vote.",
    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and ensure smaller states have influence, others argue it should better reflect the national popular will and encourage broad participation. A practical middle ground is to retain the constitutional framework but adopt reforms\u2014such as a uniform baseline of electors, proportional or ranked allocation within states, and strong national standards for voting access and election security\u2014to reduce winner-take-all distortions and the risk of disputed outcomes. These changes would preserve states\u2019 roles while making results more representative, transparent, and widely viewed as legitimate.",
    "While some Americans favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve state influence and others prefer a direct national popular vote, a practical middle path is to improve fairness and representation without abruptly changing the Constitution. States could adopt reforms such as allocating electors proportionally or by congressional district, alongside national standards for ballot access, recounts, and election security to strengthen confidence in outcomes. Over time, the country could evaluate a broader agreement\u2014such as an interstate compact tied to the national popular vote\u2014only if it demonstrably protects both majority rule and the role of states in our federal system.",
    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College protects smaller states or unfairly distorts the national popular will, there is broad room for reforms that preserve federalism while strengthening democratic legitimacy. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d outcomes by encouraging proportional allocation of electoral votes or state-level district methods, paired with national standards that expand ballot access, ensure accurate counting, and improve election security. These changes would make outcomes more representative and competitive across more states, while respecting state roles and avoiding abrupt constitutional upheaval.",
    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and encourage broad coalitions, and others want a national popular vote to ensure equal weight for every ballot, most agree the current system can be improved for fairness and legitimacy. A pragmatic middle ground is to retain the constitutional framework but reduce distortions by allocating electors proportionally or by district (with safeguards against gerrymandering), standardizing election administration, and ensuring the winner reflects clear, nationwide voter support. These reforms would respect state roles while making outcomes more representative and trusted across the political spectrum."
