That would reduce the outsized power of a few swing states, encourage broader campaigning, and improve legitimacy without an abrupt constitutional overhaul.",

A practical bridge is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by moving toward a national popular-vote outcome (through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or broader proportional allocation of electors), paired with clear nationwide baselines for ballot access, recounts, and transparent post-election audits. Adding ranked-choice voting where feasible can reduce \u201cspoiler\u201d fears and encourage broader, cross-regional support. Any changes should be simple, transparent, and designed to strengthen trust and acceptance of results across party lines.",
