A workable bridge is either adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once enough states join or requiring states to allocate electors proportionally, paired with uniform baseline standards for ballot access, counting, and transparent audits/recounts so outcomes are trusted. If further modernization is needed, adding ranked-choice voting and/or modestly expanding the House can help ensure winners have broad support and representation better matches population, without abrupt constitutional upheaval.",

A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College framework but reduce winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (with strong protections against gerrymandering if any district method is used), and to set clear national baseline standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races. If broader agreement grows, states could also choose to join a national popular-vote compact, ideally paired with ranked-choice voting so the winner reflects majority support. Any reform should be transparent, easy to understand, and focused on legitimacy and trust for both winners and losers.",
