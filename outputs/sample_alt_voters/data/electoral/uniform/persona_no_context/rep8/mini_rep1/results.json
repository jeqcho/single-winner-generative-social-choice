A workable compromise is to end winner-take-all by using proportional elector allocation (with a minimum threshold to avoid extreme fragmentation) and to adopt shared national baselines for ballot access, tabulation, audits, and recounts so close elections are resolved transparently. If momentum builds for going further, states could choose to join an interstate agreement that awards electors to the national vote winner, but only once clear rules and verification standards are in place.",

A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district) and add clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts to improve legitimacy. If broader alignment with the national popular will is desired, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can provide a phased path once enough states join, with safeguards like ranked-choice voting to ensure majority-backed outcomes and reduce spoiler fears.",
