Pair that with baseline national rules for voter access, counting timelines, recount triggers, and transparent audits so the same election is run to comparable standards in every state. Over time, reforms could be phased in through broad state agreement (including compacts) to ensure legitimacy, protect smaller-state interests, and reduce the dominance of a few battleground states.",
