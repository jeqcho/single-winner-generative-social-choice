A practical path is to move away from winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or a national popular vote via the Interstate Compact once enough states join), paired with clear nationwide baseline standards for registration, ballot access, paper-backed audits, and recount rules. Adding an option like ranked-choice voting can reduce spoiler fears and encourage candidates to build broader, cross-regional support. Changes should be phased in transparently with bipartisan oversight so people across parties can trust the rules before they trust the results.",
