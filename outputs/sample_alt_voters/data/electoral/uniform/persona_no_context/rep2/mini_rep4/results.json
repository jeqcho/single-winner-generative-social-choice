If the country moves toward a national popular vote through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, it should include clear recount triggers, consistent certification timelines, and a transparent audit process so close elections don\u2019t become nationwide chaos. Across any reform, agree on baseline national standards for ballot access and counting\u2014set by law and applied evenly\u2014while leaving day-to-day administration to states so both big-city voters and smaller communities trust the result.",
