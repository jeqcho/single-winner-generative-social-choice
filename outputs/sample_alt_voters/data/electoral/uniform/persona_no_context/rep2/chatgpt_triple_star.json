    "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort popular will and that states\u2019 interests and federalism matter, we should pursue measured reforms\u2014such as keeping state-based electors but adopting the national popular vote compact or proportionally allocating electoral votes\u2014to better reflect voters\u2019 preferences without upending the constitutional balance. These changes aim to preserve the role of states and encourage broad campaigning while ensuring every vote carries more equal weight, striking a pragmatic compromise between those favoring outright abolition and those defending the current system."
