    "Recognizing concerns about both democratic fairness and the protection of regional interests, we should pursue reforms that preserve the federal character of presidential elections while ensuring each vote has comparable weight; for example, adopting a national popular vote compact among states combined with safeguards for small-state representation in the nominating process. Such a compromise acknowledges calls for greater equality and legitimacy in outcomes while retaining mechanisms that encourage candidates to address diverse regional needs."
