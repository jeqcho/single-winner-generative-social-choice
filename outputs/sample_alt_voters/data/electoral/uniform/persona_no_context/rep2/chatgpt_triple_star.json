    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and state influence and others want a national popular vote to ensure equal weight for every ballot, most can agree the system should better reflect voters while maintaining broad geographic legitimacy. A workable middle ground is to keep the Electoral College framework but adopt reforms\u2014such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or allocating electors by the statewide vote with uniform standards\u2014that make outcomes more consistent with the national vote and reduce incentives to focus only on a few swing states. Any change should be paired with clear nationwide election rules and safeguards to strengthen public confidence and ensure every eligible voter can participate on equal terms."
