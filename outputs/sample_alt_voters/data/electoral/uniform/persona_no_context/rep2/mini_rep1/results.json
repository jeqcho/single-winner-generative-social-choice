A practical bridge is to require electors to reflect each state\u2019s popular vote, ideally through proportional allocation (with a credible path like the National Popular Vote compact where states choose), paired with uniform, transparent standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount timelines. Adding optional ranked-choice voting can help ensure the winner has broad, legitimate support while building trust that every lawful vote is counted fairly in every community.",

A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College but reduce winner-take-all by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors, and/or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once enough states join, with ranked-choice voting as an option to ensure the winner has broad support. Whatever the model, the non\u2011negotiables should be clear, uniform rules for ballot access and counting, strong paper trails and audits, and predictable recount timelines so results are trusted and disputes don\u2019t drag on.",
