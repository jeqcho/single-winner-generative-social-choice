A practical compromise is for states to move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or by district (with safeguards against gerrymandering), while strengthening rules that bind electors to the state\u2019s popular vote and tightening recount and audit procedures. Any reform should be paired with clear, consistent nationwide standards for ballot access, security, and transparent certification so the process is easier to trust in every state and candidates have incentives to campaign beyond a few swing areas.",

States could also join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once enough states participate, and allow ranked-choice voting where adopted to ensure majority support, while keeping voting access workable for busy families and working communities.",
