To reduce spoilers and encourage cross-regional coalitions, states could adopt ranked-choice voting for president (or for allocating electors) while phasing changes in on a clear timetable with bipartisan oversight.",

A broadly acceptable reform is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by requiring proportional (or otherwise fair, anti-gerrymander) allocation of electors within states, alongside clear national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount thresholds in close races. As additional states agree, an interstate compact or similar mechanism could provide a stepwise path toward a de facto national popular vote without abruptly rewriting the constitutional structure.",

A strong middle ground is to keep the Electoral College but require proportional allocation of electors in every state (or a district method with anti-gerrymandering safeguards), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, automatic recount triggers, and transparent audits.
