A practical middle ground is for states to allocate electors proportionally (or through a fair district method with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) and to support the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once enough states join, so every vote matters more without a sudden constitutional rupture. Any change should come with clear, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and automatic recounts in close elections, so the process is transparent, verifiable, and broadly trusted.",

A practical middle path is to reduce winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once enough states join), paired with clear national standards for ballots, recount triggers, and secure paper-backed audits. Adding a ranked-choice or runoff-style safeguard can ensure the winner has broad support, while reducing incentives to campaign only in a handful of swing states. Any changes should be phased in and bipartisan, so rural, urban, and smaller-state communities alike can trust the result even when their candidate loses.",
