A workable compromise is to end statewide winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (with anti-gerrymandering safeguards if districts are used), alongside uniform baseline rules for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount thresholds. Over time, if these changes prove stable and widely trusted, the country could consider a national popular vote mechanism with a majority requirement such as ranked-choice, through a transparent constitutional process.",
