This approach preserves federalism and regional voice while making outcomes track the popular vote more closely and reducing the outsized power of a few swing states.",

A practical compromise is to require every state to allocate electors proportionally (or by district with anti-gerrymandering safeguards), paired with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts so close results are handled consistently. If broader agreement emerges, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact could be a next step once uniform administration and verification rules are in place.
