To reduce incentives to game the system, Congress should set baseline national standards for ballot access, paper-audit trails, and elector binding so results are transparent and predictable. Alongside that, expanding the House (and thus the number of electors) would shrink the state-size distortion without forcing a full constitutional shift to a pure national popular vote.",

A broadly workable middle path is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through a strengthened National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with clear nationwide baseline rules for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount thresholds. To build trust across parties, electors should be bound to the certified results, with strong protections for election workers and transparent, auditable procedures so people can see that every lawful vote is counted the same.",

A strong compromise is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state (with a clear, nationwide baseline for ballot access, counting, recount triggers, and audits), and to reinforce that electors must follow the certified vote. If the country wants a fuller shift over time, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a bridge, but any change should prioritize equal access to voting, transparency, and confidence for urban, rural, working, and retired Americans alike.",
