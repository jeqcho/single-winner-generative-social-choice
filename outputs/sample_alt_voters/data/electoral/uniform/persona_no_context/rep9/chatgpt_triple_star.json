    "Many people value the Electoral College for balancing state and regional interests, while others want elections to reflect the national popular will more directly. A workable middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but reform how states allocate electors\u2014such as adopting proportional or ranked-choice allocation within states, expanding voter access, and requiring uniform post-election audits\u2014so outcomes more closely match voter preferences without eliminating state roles. Alongside this, states could pursue an interstate compact or other reforms only if they achieve broad, bipartisan support and clear rules that preserve stability and public trust."
