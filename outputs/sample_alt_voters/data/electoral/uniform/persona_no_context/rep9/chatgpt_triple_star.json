    "While recognizing concerns about both democratic fairness and state representation, the United States should pursue targeted reforms to the Electoral College\u2014such as adopting the national popular vote interstate compact or proportional allocation of electors by states\u2014while preserving elements that protect smaller states\u2019 influence. These changes should be implemented through transparent, bipartisan legislation and, where appropriate, constitutional amendment, accompanied by public education to ensure legitimacy and trust across diverse political perspectives."
