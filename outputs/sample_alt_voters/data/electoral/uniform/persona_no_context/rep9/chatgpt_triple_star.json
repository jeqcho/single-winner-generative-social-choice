    "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the popular will and that abolishing it outright raises constitutional and federalist issues, we should pursue pragmatic reforms that increase fairness and public confidence. Reasonable changes\u2014such as adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, ensuring proportional allocation of electors at the state level, or enhancing safeguards for faithless electors\u2014can preserve state interests while better reflecting voters\u2019 choices and encouraging broader turnout and campaign attention across regions."
