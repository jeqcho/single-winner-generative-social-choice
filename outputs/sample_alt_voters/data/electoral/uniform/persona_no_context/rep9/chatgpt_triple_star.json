    "People disagree on whether the Electoral College protects federalism and smaller states or undermines the principle of one person, one vote, but most share goals of legitimacy, broad participation, and confidence in outcomes. A pragmatic middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework while reducing winner-take-all distortions through reforms like proportional allocation of electors or district-based allocation paired with national standards for ballot access, recounts, and election security. If experience shows these steps improve fairness without destabilizing the system, states and Congress could then consider further measures\u2014such as the National Popular Vote compact or a constitutional amendment\u2014through a deliberate, bipartisan process.",
    "Many people value the Electoral College for preserving a federal balance and encouraging broad, cross-state coalitions, while others argue it can override the national popular vote and disadvantage voters in noncompetitive states. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms\u2014such as expanding the House to reduce distortions, awarding electors by congressional district or proportionally, and strengthening nationwide election standards and recount procedures\u2014to better align outcomes with voter preferences. Pairing these steps with transparent review after several election cycles can build trust and allow further adjustments if the reforms do not improve fairness and legitimacy.",
    "Americans have legitimate differences about whether the Electoral College protects federalism and small-state influence or unfairly distorts the principle of one person, one vote, but most agree the president should have broad democratic legitimacy. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework while adopting reforms that better align outcomes with the national popular will\u2014such as awarding electors proportionally or by district, strengthening nationwide election standards, and encouraging states to join an interstate compact once clear safeguards and broad bipartisan support are in place. These steps preserve the role of states while reducing incentives to focus on a handful of swing states and increasing confidence that every vote meaningfully counts.",
    "Many Americans value the Electoral College for preserving federalism and encouraging candidates to compete across states, while others want a system that more directly reflects the national popular will. A practical middle ground is to keep the state-based framework but reduce the chances of \u201cwrong-winner\u201d outcomes by adopting reforms like proportional allocation of electors, ranked-choice voting within states, and a uniform national standard for elections and recounts. Pairing these changes with targeted incentives for campaigning in smaller and swing-prone states can protect regional representation while making outcomes feel fairer and more legitimate to more voters.",
    "A balanced approach is to preserve the Electoral College\u2019s role in ensuring broad geographic support while addressing concerns about fairness and legitimacy. Reforms could include adopting uniform standards for how states allocate electors (such as proportional allocation or a district-based model), expanding voter access, and improving transparency and security in election administration. If a stronger popular-vote connection is desired, states could also consider coordinated compacts or automatic recount triggers that ensure the winner reflects both national support and cross-state consensus."
