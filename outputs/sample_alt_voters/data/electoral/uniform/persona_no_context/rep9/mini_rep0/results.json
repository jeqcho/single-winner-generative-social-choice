To address representation concerns without scrapping the system, Congress could also expand the House to better align electoral votes with population while preserving each state\u2019s distinct voice.",

A practical bridge is to move toward a National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors within states, paired with clear, uniform nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, recounts, and certification. Any changes should be transparent, secure, and designed to build cross-partisan trust\u2014so families in cities and rural towns alike can understand the rules and accept the result.",

States that want to go further could join a carefully designed National Popular Vote compact only once broad participation thresholds are met, so the winner reflects the national will without abrupt, partisan-feeling rule changes.",
