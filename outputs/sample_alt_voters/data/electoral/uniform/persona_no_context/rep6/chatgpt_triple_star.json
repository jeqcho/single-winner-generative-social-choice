    "Many Americans value the Electoral College for preserving the voice of smaller states and reinforcing our federal structure, while others want elections to reflect the national popular will more directly. A workable middle ground is to keep the state-based system but modernize it by adopting reforms that better align electoral outcomes with voter preferences\u2014such as requiring states to allocate electors proportionally or by congressional district, setting uniform national standards for ballot access and recounts, and strengthening safeguards against faithless electors. These steps can reduce the risk of mismatches between the popular vote and the outcome while maintaining the role of states in presidential elections."
