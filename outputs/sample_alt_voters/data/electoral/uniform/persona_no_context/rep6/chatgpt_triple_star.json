    "Recognizing concerns about both democratic representation and the stability of presidential elections, we should reform the Electoral College to better reflect the popular will while preserving federalist principles\u2014for example by adopting a national popular vote compact or allocating electors proportionally by congressional district with safeguards for close outcomes. Such reforms would respect states' roles, reduce disenfranchisement of voters in safe states, and include built-in reviews and sunset provisions to ensure they maintain fair competition and election integrity."
