    "While recognizing concerns about both democratic representation and the stability that the Electoral College is said to provide, the system should be reformed to better reflect the popular will while preserving mechanisms that encourage broad, nationwide support for candidates. A compromise path \u2014 such as keeping the Electoral College framework but adopting measures like proportional allocation of electors by state, a national popular vote compact that activates when enough states join, and clearer rules for faithless electors and contested results \u2014 balances the goals of fair representation, protection of minority interests, and electoral certainty."
