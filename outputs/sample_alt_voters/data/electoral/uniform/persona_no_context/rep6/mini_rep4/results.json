If the public later prefers a true national popular vote, the National Popular Vote compact can serve as a reversible pilot once those integrity standards are in place.",

A practical path is to reduce winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards) and set clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount timelines.
