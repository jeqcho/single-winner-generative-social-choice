A practical bridge is proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors within each state, paired with clear national baselines for ballot access, counting, recount thresholds, and transparent audits to strengthen legitimacy. If the country wants to move further toward a national popular vote, it should be phased in through the National Popular Vote compact or a careful amendment process, with safeguards that encourage broad, nationwide support so both urban and rural communities remain meaningfully heard.",

States could adopt proportional or district-based allocation (with a small statewide component), paired with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, secure paper records, audits, and uniform recount triggers to build confidence.
