A balanced path is to move away from winner-take-all by having states award electors proportionally (with a small threshold to prevent extreme fragmentation) and pair that with baseline national standards for ballot access, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. If the country later opts for a national popular vote, it should be phased in only after those shared integrity and transparency standards are in place so results are both fair and widely trusted.",
