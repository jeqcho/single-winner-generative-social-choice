A practical middle-ground is to replace winner-take-all with proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors nationwide, paired with clear, uniform baseline standards for ballot access, counting, recounts, and routine post-election audits so results are transparent and verifiable. If broader agreement emerges, states could also pursue a National Popular Vote approach or ranked-choice voting to ensure majority support, but any change should be simple to administer and protect both rural and urban voices.",
