Over time, states could opt into an interstate agreement that guarantees the national popular-vote winner once the new standards are in place and a clear transition threshold is met, reducing the risk of sudden disruption.",

A workable compromise is to keep the Electoral College but replace winner-take-all with proportional (or Maine/Nebraska-style district) allocation, require electors to follow their state\u2019s vote, and adopt clear nationwide standards for ballot access, voter-roll accuracy, audits, and recounts.
