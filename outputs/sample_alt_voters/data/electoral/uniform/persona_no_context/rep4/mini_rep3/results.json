A pragmatic path is to curb winner-take-all by encouraging proportional or multi-district allocation of electors and to add a national popular-vote backstop (via compact or statute where possible) that triggers only when the Electoral College result would contradict the popular vote. Pair either approach with uniform minimum standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts so outcomes are verifiable, predictable, and accepted across large and small states alike.",

States that prefer an even closer link to the people\u2019s choice could join a National Popular Vote compact once it includes uniform transparency and a predictable national recount trigger.

A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation in every state (with an option to adopt the National Popular Vote compact once it has broad buy-in), paired with ranked-choice voting to ensure the winner has majority support. Back these changes with clear national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts, plus enforceable rules against faithless electors, so results are transparent, secure, and easier to accept across parties.",
