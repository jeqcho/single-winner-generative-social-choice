A workable compromise is to end winner-take-all by encouraging proportional elector allocation in every state (with a minimum threshold to avoid excessive fragmentation) and to adopt shared national baselines for voter access, counting, audits, and recount triggers. If broader change is desired, the National Popular Vote compact can be a transition tool, but only alongside transparent, uniform administration so results are accepted across regions and parties.",

A practical middle ground is to end statewide winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or congressional-district) allocation of electors, paired with clear, uniform rules for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers to strengthen transparency and trust. States that want an additional step could join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once common standards and safeguards are in place, so every vote matters without abruptly discarding federal balance.",

A practical compromise is to end statewide winner-take-all by moving to proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, and to expand the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact as states choose, so the national winner is less likely to diverge from the popular vote. Whatever the model, consistent baseline rules for ballot access, recount triggers, audits, and elector obligations would improve transparency, security, and legitimacy for voters in both large metros and small towns.",
