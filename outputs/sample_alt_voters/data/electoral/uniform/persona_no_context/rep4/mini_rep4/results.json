A strong middle-ground path is for states to move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or by district (with electors bound to the state vote), paired with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts. Over time, the system could also incorporate a national popular-vote mechanism\u2014such as an interstate compact or a ranked-choice/runoff trigger\u2014to ensure the winner has broad support and the result matches the country\u2019s will more closely.

A broadly acceptable path is to reduce winner-take-all by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation and requiring electors to reflect the state\u2019s vote, while setting clear national baseline standards for ballot access, secure audits, and transparent recounts. If the country later moves toward a national popular-vote outcome (by compact or amendment), pairing it with ranked-choice or an automatic runoff can ensure the winner has broad support and protect confidence in close elections.",
