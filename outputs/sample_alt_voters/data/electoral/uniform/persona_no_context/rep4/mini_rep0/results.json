This would reduce \u201cwrong-winner\u201d risk and swing-state overfocus while preserving federalism and improving confidence that the same clear rules apply everywhere.",

This approach preserves federalism and a meaningful role for smaller and rural communities while making each vote matter more equally and boosting confidence in close elections.",

A practical compromise is for states to move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with a small statewide bonus), and to adopt the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact if enough states join, paired with ranked-choice voting to ensure majority support. Any reform should include clear, uniform baseline standards for ballot access, secure audits, and recount timelines, plus binding electors to their state\u2019s certified results\u2014so both fraud concerns and disenfranchisement concerns are addressed. The aim is simple: fewer \u201cwrong-winner\u201d outcomes, less swing-state distortion, and rules that feel fair to urban, suburban, and rural voters alike.",
