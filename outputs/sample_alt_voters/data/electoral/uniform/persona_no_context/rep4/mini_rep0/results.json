A workable compromise is to curb winner-take-all by encouraging proportional elector allocation (or a uniform district method with independent redistricting) and to adopt nationwide baseline rules for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers so close results are trusted. If broader change is desired, an interstate compact could be written with clear thresholds and transparency requirements so it activates only with wide, cross\u2011regional support. The goal is a system where every lawful vote matters, every region remains relevant, and disputes are harder to manufacture.",

If broader agreement emerges, an orderly next step could be an interstate compact that aligns the Electoral College outcome with the national popular vote once enough states join, so change is predictable rather than abrupt.",
