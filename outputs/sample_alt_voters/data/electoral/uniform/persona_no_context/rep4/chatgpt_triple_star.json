    "Many Americans value the Electoral College for preserving state influence and encouraging broad, coalition-based campaigns, while others see it as falling short of the principle that every vote should count equally. A workable middle ground is to keep its constitutional framework but modernize it so outcomes more closely reflect the national popular will\u2014such as requiring states to allocate electors proportionally or by congressional district, strengthening election security and transparency, and creating clear, uniform standards for recounts and disputes. These reforms can reduce \"winner-take-all\" distortions and improve legitimacy without forcing an all-or-nothing overhaul that would be unlikely to gain broad support."
