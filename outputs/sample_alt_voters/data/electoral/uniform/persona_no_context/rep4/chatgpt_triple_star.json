    "While recognizing concerns about both the Electoral College\u2019s role in preserving federalism and the ways it can distort the popular will, we should pursue targeted reforms that increase democratic legitimacy without eliminating state influence\u2014such as adopting a national popular vote compact or proportional allocation of electors combined with safeguards to protect small-state voice. Any changes should be implemented through transparent, bipartisan processes that include public education and consideration of constitutional pathways, balancing majority rule with protections for regional representation and political stability."
