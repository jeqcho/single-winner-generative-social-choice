    "The Electoral College should be reformed to better reflect the popular will while preserving protections for smaller states and encouraging national campaign engagement; practical changes\u2014such as adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, adjusting allocation rules to award electoral votes proportionally, or instituting targeted safeguards against faithless electors\u2014can bridge concerns about democratic legitimacy and federalism. By pursuing incremental, transparent reforms with bipartisan input and clear constitutional safeguards, we can strengthen public confidence in presidential elections without upending the constitutional balance among states."
