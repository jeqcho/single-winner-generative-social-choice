A strong compromise is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through a district-plus-statewide method) nationwide, paired with clear, uniform rules for ballot access, audits, and recounts. If a broader shift is desired, the National Popular Vote compact could be a phased option once enough states join, so the winner reliably matches the national vote without a sudden constitutional overhaul.",
