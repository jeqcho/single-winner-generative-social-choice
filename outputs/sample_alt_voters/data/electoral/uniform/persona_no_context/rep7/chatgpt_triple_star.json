    "Any reform to the Electoral College should preserve its role in encouraging broad, national coalitions while ensuring that every voter\u2019s voice is counted fairly and outcomes reflect public confidence. A workable middle path is to keep the constitutional framework but modernize it through measures like a uniform national standard for ballot access and recounts, curbing winner-take-all distortions, and exploring interstate approaches that align electoral votes more closely with the national popular vote. These steps can address concerns about legitimacy and unequal influence without requiring immediate, sweeping constitutional change."
