    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and encourage broad geographic coalitions, others argue it should better reflect the national popular will and ensure equal weight for each vote. A pragmatic middle ground is to retain the state-based framework but adopt reforms that reduce winner-take-all distortions\u2014such as allocating electors by congressional district or proportionally\u2014paired with nationwide standards for voting access, recounts, and election administration. To address legitimacy concerns, these reforms could be complemented by a trigger like the National Popular Vote compact or an automatic recount threshold in very close elections, balancing state interests with democratic fairness.",
    "Any reform to the Electoral College should preserve the federal principle that states matter while ensuring the winner reflects broad national support and every vote is meaningful. A balanced path could include adopting a national popular vote compact or a constitutional amendment only if paired with safeguards like clear nationwide standards for ballot access and counting, strong recount rules, and incentives for candidates to campaign beyond a handful of swing states. Short of abolition, states can also expand proportional or district-based allocation of electors to better mirror voter preferences. The shared goal is a system that is legitimate, stable, and trusted across regions and parties.",
    "While opinions differ on whether the Electoral College should be preserved or replaced, many Americans can agree the system should better reflect voters\u2019 will while maintaining confidence that all states have a meaningful stake in presidential elections. A pragmatic path is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms that reduce distortions\u2014such as expanding the House to rebalance representation, encouraging broader allocation of electoral votes, and adding uniform national standards for ballot access, recounts, and election security. These steps can improve fairness and legitimacy without forcing an abrupt, polarizing overhaul.",
    "Many Americans value the Electoral College for preserving the role of states and encouraging broad coalitions, while others worry it can conflict with the popular vote and weaken confidence in election outcomes. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but modernize it through reforms that better align results with voters, such as expanding the use of proportional or district-based allocation of electors, setting clear national standards for recounts and election administration, and considering a popular-vote compact once it proves durable and widely supported. This approach preserves federalism and stability while reducing the chances of a perceived mismatch between the national vote and the presidency.",
    "While Americans differ on whether the Electoral College should be preserved or replaced, many agree that presidential elections should reflect the will of voters while maintaining broad confidence across states and parties. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but modernize it through reforms\u2014such as ensuring states allocate electors in ways that better match their popular vote, adopting uniform standards for election administration and recounts, and reducing incentives for a few swing states to dominate campaigns. These steps can strengthen legitimacy and representation without requiring an immediate, high-risk overhaul."
