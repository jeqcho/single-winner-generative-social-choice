    "While respecting the Electoral College\u2019s role in balancing state and regional interests, we should pursue reforms that enhance fairness and democratic legitimacy\u2014such as allocating electoral votes by congressional district with safeguards to protect minority representation, or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact to ensure the winner of the popular vote prevails. Any change should be implemented through transparent, bipartisan processes that preserve federalism, reduce incentives for disproportionate campaigning in a few swing states, and protect minority voting rights."
