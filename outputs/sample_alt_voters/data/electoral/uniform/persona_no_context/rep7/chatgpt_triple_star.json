    "Recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can both over- and under-represent voters, we should pursue targeted reforms that preserve the principle of federalism while making outcomes more reflective of the national popular will\u2014such as adopting a national popular vote compact among states or allocating electors proportionally rather than winner-take-all. These changes should be implemented through state legislatures and, where appropriate, constitutional amendment, accompanied by safeguards for minority and regional interests to ensure broad buy-in across political perspectives."
