One workable path is a phased package: require proportional elector allocation (or a uniform ranked-choice tally for president) alongside an expanded House to rebalance representation, with a federal floor for ballot access, counting procedures, recount triggers, and post-election audits. That combination preserves federalism, makes more votes matter in more places, and strengthens legitimacy in close elections without forcing an abrupt, all-at-once rewrite.",

A practical bridge is either adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or requiring proportional allocation of each state\u2019s electors, with ranked-choice/automatic runoff to ensure a majority-supported winner. Whatever path is chosen, pair it with clear, uniform baseline standards for ballot access, counting, recounts, and automatic audits so results are transparent, predictable, and broadly trusted.",

A strong middle ground is ending winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors nationwide, and pairing it with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, recounts, and risk-limiting audits. If broader agreement emerges, states could also pursue a carefully phased National Popular Vote approach with a ranked-choice or runoff backstop so the winner has majority support. The goal is a transparent system that rewards broad coalitions and gives voters in every state reason to participate.",
