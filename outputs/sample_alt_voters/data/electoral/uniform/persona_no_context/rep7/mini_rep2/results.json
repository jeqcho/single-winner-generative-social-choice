Pair any change with clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts, and consider ranked-choice voting to ensure the winner has broad support and improve legitimacy.",

A practical middle-ground is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with anti-gerrymandering guardrails), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts so results are transparent and trusted.
