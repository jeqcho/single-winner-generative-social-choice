A practical bridge is to reduce winner-take-all distortions through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact and/or proportional (or district-based) elector allocation, paired with ranked-choice voting to reward majority support and consensus-building campaigns. Whatever path is chosen should include clear, uniform baseline standards for voting access, ballot counting, auditing, and recounts so close elections are handled transparently and results are widely trusted.",

A strong middle path is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions\u2014through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, security, audits, and automatic recount thresholds. Adding a ranked-choice option where feasible can ensure presidents win broad support and lower the sense that elections hinge on a few swing states.
