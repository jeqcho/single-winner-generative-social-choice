A workable middle path is to curb winner-take-all by requiring states to allocate electors proportionally (with a minimum threshold) and to adopt uniform baseline rules for ballot access, counting, recounts, and risk-limiting audits. If the country later moves to a national popular vote, it should be phased in with ranked-choice ballots and clear national standards so outcomes remain trusted, transparent, and hard to manipulate.",

A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by encouraging proportional (or district-based with a small statewide bonus) allocation of electors, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, transparent recount triggers, and strong post\u2011election audits. States that want a further step could join a safeguarded National Popular Vote compact once those integrity and access standards are in place.
