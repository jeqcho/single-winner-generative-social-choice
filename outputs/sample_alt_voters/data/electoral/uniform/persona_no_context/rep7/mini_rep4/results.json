As an additional backstop if a broad agreement emerges, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact could be used to ensure the overall winner reflects the popular will without an abrupt constitutional overhaul.",

A workable compromise is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally (with an optional ranked-choice ballot for president), paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, recounts, and risk-limiting audits. Add guardrails against gerrymandering if any district-based system is used, so the rules are hard to game and the winner reflects broad, nationwide support.",
