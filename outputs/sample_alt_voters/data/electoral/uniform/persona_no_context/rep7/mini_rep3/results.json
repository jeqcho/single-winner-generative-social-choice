One approach is to pair a national popular-vote trigger (such as an interstate compact that activates only with strong participation and a clear margin) with proportional elector allocation in each state and a modernized House to reduce small-state distortion. Alongside any structural change, baseline national rules for ballot access, counting timelines, audits, and automatic recounts would help both sides trust close results while preserving the federal character of the system.",

A practical path is either the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or a rule requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state, paired with expanding the House to reduce small-state distortion and lessen \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d incentives.
