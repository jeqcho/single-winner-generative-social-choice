If these steps build confidence, a national popular-vote approach\u2014through an interstate compact or amendment\u2014could be phased in with a clear majority standard and an automatic runoff or ranked-choice to ensure broad legitimacy.",

A practical bridge is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors and/or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it has clear, enforceable rules for recounts and certification. Any change should be paired with baseline national standards for ballot access, secure paper trails, routine audits, and transparent recount procedures so close elections are trusted and candidates have incentives to compete nationwide, not just in a few swing states.",

A strong compromise is to curb winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with guardrails against gerrymandering), and to pair that with clear national minimum standards for voter access, secure paper-based auditing, and consistent recount and certification rules. If there is broad agreement and enforceable safeguards, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact could be a next step once it reliably produces a clear, widely trusted winner.",
