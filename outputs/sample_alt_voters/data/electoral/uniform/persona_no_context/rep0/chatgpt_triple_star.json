    "While recognizing the Electoral College\u2019s role in balancing state and regional interests, we should pursue targeted reforms that enhance democratic fairness and voter equity\u2014such as adopting the National Popular Vote compact, ensuring proportional allocation of electors, and strengthening safeguards against faithless electors and partisan gerrymandering. These measures preserve the federal character of presidential elections while better reflecting the national popular will and reducing incentives for candidates to ignore large segments of the electorate."
