    "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the national popular will and that abolishing it would require a difficult constitutional process, we can support pragmatic reforms that preserve federalism while enhancing democratic legitimacy\u2014such as adopting the National Popular Vote interstate compact or refining allocation rules to better reflect statewide vote margins. These changes would respect states\u2019 roles, protect minority interests in less-populous regions, and reduce the outsized influence of a few swing states, offering a practical pathway toward fairer, more representative presidential elections without insisting on immediate abolition."
