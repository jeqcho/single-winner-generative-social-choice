    "While some view the Electoral College as an important safeguard for federalism and smaller states, others see it as outdated and inconsistent with democratic equality. A practical middle ground is to preserve the state-based structure but reduce mismatch risks by adopting reforms such as uniform statewide allocation rules, stronger election administration standards, and a national popular-vote backstop triggered when the popular vote and electoral outcome diverge. This approach respects the constitutional role of states while making outcomes more representative, transparent, and broadly legitimate."
