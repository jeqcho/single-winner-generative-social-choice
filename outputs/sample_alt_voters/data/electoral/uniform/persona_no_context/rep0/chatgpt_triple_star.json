    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to protect federalism and state influence and others prefer a direct popular vote, a practical middle ground is to preserve the state-based structure while making outcomes more nationally representative and transparent. Reforms could include adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it covers a broad range of states, setting uniform standards for elector pledges and recounts, and encouraging proportional or district-based allocation within states to reduce winner-take-all distortions. This approach maintains the constitutional framework and role of states while better aligning the presidency with the will of voters and strengthening confidence in election results.",
    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College should be preserved or replaced, many share goals of making presidential elections more democratic, competitive across states, and trusted by voters. A practical middle path is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce distortions by standardizing election administration, expanding access and security, and adopting reforms\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors or an interstate compact\u2014that better align outcomes with the national popular vote. Any change should be bipartisan, transparent, and phased in to maintain stability while addressing concerns about fairness and representation.",
    "A constructive middle ground is to keep the Electoral College\u2019s federalist role while ensuring the winner reflects broad national support and every vote carries comparable weight. Reforms could include adopting proportional allocation of electors within states or a national popular vote compact triggered only when enough states join, alongside uniform standards for ballot access and recounts. This approach respects state influence and rural concerns while addressing legitimacy, competitiveness, and fairness issues raised by critics of the current system.",
    "While some Americans favor keeping the Electoral College to protect smaller states and preserve federalism, others argue it can misalign presidential outcomes with the national popular vote. A practical middle ground is to keep the state-based system but adopt reforms that better reflect voter preferences\u2014such as requiring states to allocate electors proportionally or through ranked-choice statewide tallies, and strengthening uniform standards for voting access and election administration. These changes aim to reduce winner-take-all distortions and increase legitimacy while maintaining the constitutional role of states in selecting electors.",
    "While people differ on whether the Electoral College should be preserved or replaced, many agree the system should better reflect voters\u2019 will while maintaining confidence across states. A practical middle ground is to keep the state-based framework but adopt reforms that reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors, stronger voting access and security standards, and clear rules for resolving disputes\u2014while setting a transparent trigger for moving to a national popular vote if broad bipartisan and interstate support emerges. This approach respects federalism concerns and smaller-state interests while addressing legitimacy and representation concerns that drive calls for change."
