Pair that with uniform national baselines for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers so close elections are handled consistently and transparently across states. This approach preserves federalism, reduces swing-state overconcentration, and makes it easier for people in every state to believe the result reflects the electorate rather than the rules.",

A practical path is to reduce winner-take-all by encouraging proportional allocation of electors (or a national popular-vote compact once broadly adopted), paired with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, recounts, audits, and certification so every lawful vote is handled consistently. Adding a runoff-style safeguard such as ranked-choice voting can help ensure the winner has broad support and reduce spoiler fears, building confidence for both urban and rural communities.",
