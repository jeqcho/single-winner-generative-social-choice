A practical bridge is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by adopting either the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, with transparent, uniform rules for ballot access, recounts, audits, and certification. Pairing these changes with broad voting access and nonpartisan safeguards (like independent redistricting where relevant) can help every community feel heard and encourage candidates to compete nationwide, not just in a few swing states.",
