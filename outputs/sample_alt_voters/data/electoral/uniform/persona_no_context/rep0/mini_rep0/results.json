To address concerns about close contests and uneven rules, any reform should include baseline national standards for voter access, transparent counting, and automatic, uniform recount procedures. Over time, states could optionally align with the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once these safeguards are in place, so the system moves toward reflecting the popular will without an abrupt constitutional rupture.",

A practical bridge is to curb winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation of electors (or a closely related approach like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), paired with clear national standards for ballot access, counting, recounts, and transparency. Adding ranked-choice voting where feasible can reward broader coalitions and reduce polarization, helping more Americans accept close outcomes as legitimate.",

A practical path is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through a national popular vote compact) and pair that with clear, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts to reduce disputes and increase trust. Ranked-choice voting could be added where feasible to encourage majority support and broader campaigning, with changes phased in so voters and election officials can adapt.",
