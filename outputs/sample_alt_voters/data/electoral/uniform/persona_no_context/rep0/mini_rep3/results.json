If that proves too hard to adopt quickly, states could reduce winner-take-all by moving to proportional elector allocation and expanding the House to better match population, while keeping the state-based framework intact.",

A workable middle path is for states to allocate electors proportionally (or by district with fair, nonpartisan maps) and to adopt clear, uniform rules for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts, with electors bound to the certified results. If broader change is desired, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be a bridge toward aligning the outcome with the national popular will, while encouraging candidates to compete beyond a few swing states.",

A practical compromise is a national popular-vote outcome implemented through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once uniform standards for ballot access, paper-audit verification, and transparent recounts are in place. If that\u2019s not achievable yet, states could move to proportional elector allocation and expand the House to reduce winner-take-all distortions and make each vote count more equally.
