A workable compromise is to reduce winner-take-all by using a proportional allocation of electors with a small statewide bonus, paired with nonpartisan national baselines for registration, recount triggers, audits, and certification timelines. This approach would broaden campaign incentives beyond a few battleground states and improve trust by making the rules clearer, more uniform, and harder to game.",

A practical compromise is to allocate each state\u2019s electors proportionally or by district with a modest statewide component, paired with clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, recounts, audits, and certification so every lawful vote is treated consistently.

A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with clear anti-gerrymandering rules), and require electors to follow the certified vote. Pair this with uniform national baselines for ballot access, recounts, audits, and election security so every lawful vote is counted consistently and results are easier to trust across regions and parties.",
