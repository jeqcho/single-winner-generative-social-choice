A workable compromise is to reduce or end winner-take-all by having states allocate electors proportionally using a common, auditable method, paired with nationwide baseline standards for voter access, counting timelines, and recount triggers. If the Electoral College outcome diverges from the national popular vote beyond a clear margin, a predefined backstop (such as an interstate compact or automatic national review) should ensure the winner is widely seen as legitimate. The goal is fewer swing-state distortions, stronger trust, and rules that don\u2019t tilt toward either party.",

Pair that with clear national standards for ballot access, timely counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers to boost transparency and trust. Over time, a national popular-vote backstop (such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact) could be added so the overall winner matches the people\u2019s choice while preserving a meaningful role for states.",

A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College but require proportional (not winner-take-all) allocation of electors in every state, paired with clear nationwide minimum standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts so the process is consistent and trusted. States that want to go further could join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once strong recount and certification rules are in place. Any changes should be phased in transparently with bipartisan oversight so people accept the result even when their side loses.",
