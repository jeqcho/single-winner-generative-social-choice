To address concerns about close outcomes and \u201cspoiler\u201d candidates, states could pair this with ranked-choice voting for president within each state. This approach preserves federalism and broad geographic buy-in while making campaigns compete for more voters in more places and strengthening confidence that the winner reflects the most support.",

The goal is a transparent, trusted system that reduces swing-state distortion and is legitimate to both small and large states.",

A broad compromise is to keep the Electoral College but require proportional (or district-based with strong anti-gerrymandering rules) allocation of electors, and allow a National Popular Vote agreement as an optional path if states choose it.
