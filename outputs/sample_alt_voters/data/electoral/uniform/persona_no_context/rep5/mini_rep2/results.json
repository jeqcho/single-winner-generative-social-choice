This would make more votes matter in every state, reduce the outsized focus on a few battlegrounds, and improve legitimacy no matter which party wins.",

A workable bridge is to keep the state-based system but end winner-take-all by moving to proportional (or district-plus-statewide) elector allocation and adding a national popular-vote backstop (such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact) so the winner matches the broader public will. Any change should come with clear, uniform rules for ballot access, security, audits, and recounts, adopted transparently and with bipartisan input to build confidence no matter who wins.",
