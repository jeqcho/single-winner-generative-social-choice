This approach preserves federalism and small\u2011state relevance, while making more votes matter in more places and reducing incentives to focus only on a handful of battlegrounds.",

A workable middle path is to reduce winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or by district (with safeguards against gerrymandered distortions), paired with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, recounts, and transparent audits so results are trusted. As confidence grows, states could also pursue a lawful transition option like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact to ensure the national popular vote winner prevails without a rushed constitutional fight.",

A strong middle ground is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based with safeguards against gerrymandering) allocation of electors, and to consider the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact as a transition if broad participation is reached. Whatever model is chosen, a uniform national baseline for ballot access, recounts, accessibility, and transparent post-election audits can strengthen confidence without tilting the rules toward any party. The goal is fewer \"swing-state\" distortions, more incentive to compete everywhere, and results that voters across regions can accept as fair.",
