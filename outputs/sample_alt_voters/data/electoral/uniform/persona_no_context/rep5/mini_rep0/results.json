Changes should be phased in and stress-tested so close elections are easier to verify, candidates have incentives to compete beyond a few battlegrounds, and both large and small states see the system as legitimate.",

A strong middle path is to keep the Electoral College but replace winner-take-all with proportional (or district-based) elector allocation, paired with clear nationwide baseline rules for ballot access, voter-roll maintenance, counting deadlines, automatic recount triggers, and routine post-election audits. Reforms should be phased in and designed to reduce swing-state dominance, strengthen transparency, and ensure both large cities and smaller communities feel their votes matter and the result is verifiable.",
