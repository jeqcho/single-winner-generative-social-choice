    "Any reform to the Electoral College should balance the goal of treating each vote fairly with the desire to preserve a meaningful role for states in presidential elections. A workable middle ground is to keep the Electoral College framework but reduce winner-take-all outcomes by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with a national popular-vote safeguard such as an automatic recount and review threshold when the popular-vote winner and electoral winner diverge by a narrow margin. This approach respects federalism while increasing legitimacy, transparency, and public confidence in close elections."
