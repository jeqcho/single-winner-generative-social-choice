    "While recognizing concerns about both democratic fairness and the preservation of states\u2019 interests, the Electoral College should be reformed to better reflect the national popular will while protecting meaningful roles for states. A compromise approach\u2014such as adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or a congressional district method paired with safeguards for small-state representation\u2014would increase voter equality and legitimacy without abruptly discarding federalism, and should be pursued through transparent, bipartisan processes and, where appropriate, constitutional channels."
