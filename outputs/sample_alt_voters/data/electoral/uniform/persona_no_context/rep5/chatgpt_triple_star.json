    "While respecting the Constitution and the value of state representation, we should pursue reforms that enhance the fairness and legitimacy of the presidential vote\u2014such as adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or adjusting electoral vote allocation to reflect proportional results\u2014while preserving protections for smaller states. Any changes should be enacted through constitutional means or interstate agreements, include safeguards against disenfranchisement, and aim to increase voter confidence and participation across diverse regions."
