A practical path is to reduce winner-take-all incentives by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering rules, and to allow an interstate compact option only if paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, recounts, and auditable election security. Any change should be phased in transparently so voters across parties can see that the goal is equal respect for every lawful ballot, not a partisan advantage.",
