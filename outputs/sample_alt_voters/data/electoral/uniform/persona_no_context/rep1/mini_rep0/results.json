Pair either path with clear, nationwide minimum standards for registration, ballot access, tabulation transparency, audits, and automatic recount triggers so close elections are decided by rules everyone can see and accept.",

A practical compromise is to move states toward proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors paired with strong, uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and clear recount triggers so close elections are handled consistently. For those who want an even closer match to the national popular will without an immediate constitutional amendment, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be considered alongside these safeguards.",

A broad middle path is proportional allocation of electors within each state (paired with enforceable anti-gerrymandering rules if districts are used) and clear national baselines for ballot access, secure chain-of-custody, audits, and transparent recount triggers. If consensus grows beyond that, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be considered as an additional step, but any change should prioritize trust, stability, and equal respect for every lawful vote.",
