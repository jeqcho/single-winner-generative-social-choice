A workable compromise is to keep the Electoral College but require proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors nationwide, paired with clear national baselines for ballot access, counting, audits, and timely recounts that protect both security and convenience. Over time, states could choose to further align outcomes with the national popular vote through an interstate compact once broad bipartisan buy-in exists. The guiding goals are equal weight for each lawful vote, transparent rules, and results that are easy to trust even in close elections.",
