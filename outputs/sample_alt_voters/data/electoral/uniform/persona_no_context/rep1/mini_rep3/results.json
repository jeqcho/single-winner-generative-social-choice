Key reforms could include requiring electors to follow their state\u2019s certified results, moving away from winner-take-all toward a consistent proportional method for allocating electors, and adopting clear national baseline standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts. This approach aims to make every vote feel more meaningful, reduce battleground-state distortions, and strengthen legitimacy for both large and small states.",

A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College but reduce winner-take-all by moving toward proportional allocation of electors, require electors to follow certified state results, and adopt baseline national standards for ballot access, recounts, and transparent audits. If states can agree on strong safeguards, expanding the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be considered as a next step, but any change should be simple, secure, and focused on building broad trust rather than partisan advantage.",
