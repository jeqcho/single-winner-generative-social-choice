States could allocate electors proportionally (or through a proportional, ranked-choice tally) while adopting uniform national standards for registration, ballot access, audits, and recount triggers so outcomes are transparent and comparable everywhere. This would preserve regional influence and stability, yet make campaigns compete for support in more places and make it harder for tiny margins in a few counties to decide the presidency.",
