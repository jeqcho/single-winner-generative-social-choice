    "A practical middle ground is to keep the Electoral College\u2019s role in producing clear national outcomes while modernizing it to better reflect voters and strengthen confidence in results. Reforms such as requiring states to allocate electors proportionally or by congressional district, setting uniform national standards for election administration, and increasing transparency around certification could address concerns about fairness and close elections without mandating a full constitutional overhaul. At the same time, continued evaluation of options like the National Popular Vote compact can provide a path for those seeking closer alignment with the national vote, while preserving state flexibility and political stability."
