    "Recognizing both the Electoral College\u2019s role in balancing state interests and concerns about democratic fairness, we should pursue targeted reforms\u2014such as adopting the district popular vote or proportional allocation of electoral votes while retaining federal safeguards\u2014to better reflect the national popular will without wholly discarding state influence. Any change should be implemented through broadly supported legislative or constitutional processes that protect minority interests, preserve federalism, and increase transparency and public trust in presidential elections."
