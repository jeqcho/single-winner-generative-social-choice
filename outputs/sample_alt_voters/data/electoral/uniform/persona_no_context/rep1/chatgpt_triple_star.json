    "While recognizing concerns about both democratic equality and the role of states, we should reform the Electoral College to better reflect the national popular will without discarding federalism entirely. A compromise could retain state-based electors but allocate them more proportionally and adopt safeguards\u2014such as a national popular vote compact trigger or standardized ballot access and recount rules\u2014to ensure fairness, preserve minority-state interests, and enhance voter confidence in presidential elections."
