    "While opinions differ on whether the Electoral College protects federalism and state influence or undermines majority rule, most people want elections that are fair, trusted, and reflect voters\u2019 will. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms that reduce distortions\u2014such as expanding access to voting, improving election security, and encouraging state-level changes like proportional allocation of electors or a national popular vote compact once it has broad, bipartisan support. Any changes should be transparent, phased in, and designed to preserve stability while strengthening legitimacy and representation.",
    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College should be abolished or preserved, many share the goal of ensuring every voter feels their ballot matters and that election outcomes are seen as legitimate. A workable middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms that better align electoral votes with the national popular will\u2014such as allocating electors proportionally within states, reducing winner-take-all rules, and setting clear national standards for recounts and certification. These steps can preserve federalism and state roles while making results more representative and trusted across the political spectrum.",
    "A practical consensus is to keep the Electoral College\u2019s role in balancing state and national interests while making outcomes more representative and trusted. This could include nationwide baseline voting standards, transparent audits, and reforms that reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions\u2014such as state-level proportional allocation or ranked-choice methods\u2014while preserving states\u2019 administration of elections. If broader change is considered, it should be pursued through widely supported, clearly defined rules (including for recounts and disputes) so both advocates of a national popular vote and defenders of federalism can have confidence in the system\u2019s legitimacy.",
    "While some Americans favor keeping the Electoral College and others want a direct popular vote, many can agree the system should better reflect voters\u2019 preferences while preserving meaningful representation for states. A pragmatic middle path is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d outcomes through reforms such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors, stronger election administration standards, and a clear process for resolving close results. These steps would make outcomes feel fairer and more legitimate without abruptly eliminating the role of states in presidential elections.",
    "Many people value the Electoral College for preserving federalism and ensuring smaller states have a meaningful voice, while others argue it can undermine the principle that each vote should count equally. A workable middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce winner-take-all outcomes by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with national standards that expand ballot access, strengthen election security, and ensure timely, accurate counts. We could also adopt an interstate or federal trigger that moves to a direct popular vote only if broad, bipartisan support emerges and clear safeguards are in place, so reforms improve legitimacy without destabilizing the system."
