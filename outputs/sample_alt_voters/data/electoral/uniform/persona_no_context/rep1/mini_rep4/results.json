A workable compromise is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (with a small threshold to avoid extreme fragmentation) and to bind electors to the certified vote, paired with uniform national standards for registration, ballots, audits, and automatic recount triggers. This preserves federalism and regional voice while making outcomes more transparent, competitive in more places, and easier for the losing side to accept.",
