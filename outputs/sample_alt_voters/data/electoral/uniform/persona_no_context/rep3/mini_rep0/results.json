The goal is simple, trusted rules that reduce swing-state distortion, encourage broad coalition-building, and ensure every lawful vote feels meaningful whether cast in a small town or a major city.",

A workable bridge is to curb winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation of electors (or a national popular vote via an interstate compact) and pairing it with a clear national standard for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts. Adding a ranked-choice or runoff option can ensure the winner has broad support and reduce razor-thin disputes, while keeping the rules simple, transparent, and consistent nationwide.",
