If these steps still leave repeated popular-vote mismatches, an incremental backstop like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact could be considered once it can operate transparently and predictably.",

A practical bridge is adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or requiring proportional allocation of electors, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, recounts, and routine risk-limiting audits. Adding ranked-choice voting where feasible can reduce \u201cwasted\u201d votes and reward candidates who build broader coalitions across urban, suburban, and rural communities. Any change should be phased in transparently and designed to strengthen legitimacy rather than partisan advantage.",

A strong compromise is to require states to allocate electors proportionally (or through ranked-choice within the state) and pair that with clear national standards for ballot access, secure counting, automatic audits, and transparent recount rules. This reduces winner-take-all distortions and swing-state targeting without rushing into a single centralized system, and it strengthens trust that every vote is counted fairly no matter where someone lives.",
