The most practical path is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state (or awarding by district with a proportional statewide component) and pairing that with a ranked-choice/runoff option so the winner has broad support. Alongside that, set clear national minimum standards for ballot access, secure voting, recounts, and routine audits, so results are transparent and trusted no matter where you live. This approach reduces swing-state distortions, makes more ballots matter, and avoids a sudden, winner-takes-all national system change that many people worry could be destabilizing.",
