    "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the popular will and that it protects federalism and small-state interests, Congress should pursue modest, bipartisan reforms\u2014such as adopting a national popular vote through an interstate compact or allocating electoral votes proportionally within states\u2014to ensure every vote matters while preserving state roles in the election process. Any reform package should include safeguards for minority representation, transparent counting procedures, and a clear timeline for implementation to build broad public trust and bipartisan support."
