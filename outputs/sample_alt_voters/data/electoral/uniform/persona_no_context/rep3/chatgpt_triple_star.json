    "The Electoral College should be reformed to better reflect the popular will while preserving federalism and the role of states in presidential elections; practical steps could include adopting a national popular vote compact, allocating electors proportionally within states, and improving ballot access and counting standards. These changes balance concerns that every vote should carry weight with the need to protect smaller states\u2019 interests and the constitutional framework, and they can be implemented through a mix of state legislation and bipartisan federal safeguards to ensure legitimacy and stability."
