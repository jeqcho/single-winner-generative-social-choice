    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to protect federalism and smaller states and others prefer a national popular vote for simplicity and equal weight, most Americans can agree the system should better reflect voters\u2019 will and be trusted across states. A practical middle ground is to retain the state-based framework but reduce winner-take-all outcomes by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, recounts, and election security. This approach preserves the role of states while making outcomes more representative and transparent, and it can be implemented incrementally without requiring an immediate constitutional overhaul.",
    "Many Americans value the Electoral College for preserving a federal balance and encouraging geographically broad coalitions, while others worry it can misalign the presidency with the national popular vote and depress participation in noncompetitive states. A workable middle ground is to keep its constitutional framework but adopt reforms that better reflect voter preferences\u2014such as requiring states to allocate electors proportionally or by congressional district with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards, plus uniform standards for ballot access and vote counting. These changes would reduce winner-take-all distortions and the chance of a popular-vote/electoral-vote split while maintaining the role of states and incentivizing candidates to campaign nationwide.",
    "A practical way forward is to keep the Electoral College\u2019s role in balancing state and national interests while tightening its alignment with the popular will. Reforms such as requiring states to allocate electors proportionally or through a national popular vote compact, alongside uniform standards for election administration and a clear process for resolving disputes, could reduce incentives to focus on a few swing states and strengthen legitimacy. This approach respects federalism concerns while addressing the widely shared goal that every vote should matter more equally.",
    "While some Americans favor keeping the Electoral College to protect federalism and smaller states and others prefer a direct national popular vote for equal weighting of each ballot, there is room for pragmatic reforms that improve legitimacy and competitiveness without discarding the system overnight. A balanced approach could include adopting uniform national standards for voting access and counting, expanding the use of non-winner-take-all allocation of electors within states, and exploring an interstate popular-vote compact with clear safeguards and broad bipartisan buy-in. These steps would preserve the state-based structure many value while reducing incentives to ignore non-battleground voters and ensuring the president reflects a widely supported mandate.",
    "The Electoral College has strengths that some value\u2014such as preserving a federal role for states and encouraging broad coalitions\u2014while others view it as insufficiently reflecting the national popular will. A practical middle ground is to keep the state-based framework but adopt reforms that align outcomes more closely with voters, such as requiring states to allocate electors proportionally or by district, strengthening uniform election standards, and adding a national popular-vote trigger through an interstate compact once enough states join. These steps aim to increase legitimacy and competitiveness across more states while respecting constitutional traditions and reducing the likelihood of disputed outcomes."
