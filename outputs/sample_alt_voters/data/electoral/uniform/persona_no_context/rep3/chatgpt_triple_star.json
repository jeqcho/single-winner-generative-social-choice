    "While some Americans value the Electoral College for preserving a federal balance and encouraging broad coalitions, others see it as misaligned with the principle of one person, one vote. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional structure but reduce outcomes that diverge from the national popular vote by adopting reforms such as proportional allocation of electors within states, ranked-choice voting, and uniform standards for ballot access and recounts. These changes would maintain state roles in elections while making results more representative, transparent, and broadly legitimate."
