To improve legitimacy no matter which party wins, Congress and the states should adopt baseline national rules for registration access, ballot counting, audits, and recount triggers, while leaving day-to-day administration to the states. If distortion remains high, an expanded House could be a next step to reduce the gap between state populations and electoral votes without rewriting the Constitution overnight.",

A practical middle-ground is to keep the Electoral College but curb winner-take-all by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation (with clear, uniform recount and certification rules), alongside stronger national baselines for ballot access, security, and transparent audits. Additional modernization like expanding the House to reduce representational distortion can improve legitimacy without abruptly dismantling the federal structure.",

A workable compromise is to keep the Electoral College but reduce winner-take-all by having states allocate electors proportionally or by district with a small statewide component, and to expand the House so electoral votes track population more fairly. Pair that with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, secure audits, and transparent recount/certification rules so every side can trust the count and candidates have incentives to compete beyond a few swing states.",
