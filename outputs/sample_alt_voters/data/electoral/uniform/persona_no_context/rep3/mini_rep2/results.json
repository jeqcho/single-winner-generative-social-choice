A workable compromise is to reduce winner-take-all by encouraging proportional elector allocation (or multi-member/statewide methods) and add a national backstop that awards the presidency to the popular-vote leader when the Electoral College result would diverge. Pair any change with uniform baseline rules for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers so outcomes are predictable, transparent, and harder to manipulate. The goal is fewer \u201cswing state\u201d distortions and more legitimacy without a sudden rewrite that leaves smaller states feeling erased.",
