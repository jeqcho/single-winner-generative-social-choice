A strong compromise is to keep the Electoral College but require proportional allocation of electors in every state (ending winner-take-all), paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, recounts, and routine post-election audits so close results are trusted. For those who want an eventual popular-vote approach, states could also pursue a transparent, phased pathway such as the National Popular Vote compact, with safeguards that encourage campaigning nationwide rather than only in a few swing areas.",
