A workable compromise is for states to move away from winner\u2011take\u2011all toward proportional allocation of electors (with clear protections against faithless electors), while continuing to evaluate an interstate popular\u2011vote compact as more states adopt it. Any change should be paired with nationwide baseline standards\u2014easy-to-understand ballots, secure paper records, automatic risk\u2011limiting audits, and clear recount rules\u2014so results are transparent, trusted, and candidates compete in more places than just a few swing states.",
