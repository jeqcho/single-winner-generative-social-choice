    "While some value the Electoral College for balancing state and regional interests and others prefer a direct national popular vote, most can agree that every voter\u2019s voice should carry meaningful weight and that the system should produce clear, legitimate outcomes. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but modernize how states allocate electors\u2014such as adopting uniform district-based allocation with safeguards against extreme gerrymandering, stronger recount/audit standards, and a clear, consistent process for resolving disputes. These reforms could reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions and battleground-state incentives while preserving federalism and improving public confidence in presidential elections."
