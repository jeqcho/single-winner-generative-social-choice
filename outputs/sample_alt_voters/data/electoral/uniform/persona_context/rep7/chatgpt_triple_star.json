    "Many Americans value the Electoral College for preserving federalism and encouraging broad, geographically diverse coalitions, while others believe it should better reflect the national popular will. A workable middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but modernize it by expanding the House to reduce vote disparities, encouraging states to allocate electors more proportionally (with safeguards for recounts and close results), and strengthening nationwide election standards and auditing. These reforms would preserve the role of states while making outcomes feel fairer and more representative to voters across the country.",
    "While some Americans value the Electoral College for balancing state and regional interests and others prefer a direct national popular vote, most can agree the system should reflect voters\u2019 choices clearly and fairly. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms that reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors or ranked-choice/instant-runoff mechanisms within states\u2014and strengthen uniform election standards and transparency. These steps preserve federalism and state roles while making outcomes more representative and increasing public confidence in close elections.",
    "While people disagree about whether to keep, reform, or replace the Electoral College, most share goals of fair representation, legitimacy, and national cohesion. A practical middle ground is to retain a federal role in presidential elections but modernize the system to better reflect the popular vote\u2014such as allocating electors proportionally within states, adopting ranked-choice voting, or using an interstate compact that takes effect only when enough states join. Any change should be paired with clear national standards for ballot access and recounts, and should aim to preserve state participation while reducing incentives to focus on only a few swing states.",
    "Many Americans value the Electoral College for protecting federalism and encouraging broad geographic coalitions, while others want a system that more directly reflects the national popular will. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms that better align outcomes with voters\u2014such as nationwide standards for election administration, expanding the House to reduce distortions, and encouraging states to award electoral votes proportionally or through a coordinated compact. These changes preserve state roles while improving fairness, legitimacy, and public confidence in presidential elections.",
    "While some view the Electoral College as a safeguard for federalism and small-state influence and others see it as distorting the popular will, a pragmatic path is to preserve its basic structure while tightening its democratic responsiveness. Reforms could include uniform national standards for ballot access and recounts, requiring states to allocate electors proportionally or by district to reduce winner-take-all distortions, and adopting a compact or federal incentives to ensure the presidency aligns more closely with the national popular vote without requiring immediate constitutional abolition. This approach respects state roles and regional balance while improving legitimacy, reducing incentives to ignore non-swing states, and increasing public confidence in outcomes."
