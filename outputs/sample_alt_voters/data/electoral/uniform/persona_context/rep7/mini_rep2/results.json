At the same time, set enforceable national baseline rules for registration and ballot access, chain-of-custody, risk-limiting audits, and automatic recount triggers, while letting states exceed those standards. This preserves a meaningful state role and regional balance, reduces battleground-state distortions, and makes outcomes easier to verify and accept.",

Pair this with clear, uniform national baseline rules for ballot access, transparent post\u2011election audits, and automatic recount triggers so every lawful ballot is handled consistently and results are easy to verify.
