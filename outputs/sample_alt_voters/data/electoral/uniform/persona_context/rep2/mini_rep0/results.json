If the country later seeks closer alignment with the national will, a widely adopted National Popular Vote compact\u2014ideally with a majority requirement such as ranked-choice voting\u2014can build on that foundation without sacrificing transparency or legitimacy.",

A strong, achievable step is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (with clearly defined rules) and to bind electors to certified results. Any change should be paired with simple, uniform national baselines for ballot access, paper-backed audits, secure chain-of-custody, and automatic recount triggers so close elections are handled consistently and trust is higher. If the country wants to go further, a national popular-vote approach (such as the NPV compact) should include a majority requirement like ranked-choice voting or a runoff so the winner has broad support.",
