    "While some view the Electoral College as an important safeguard for federalism and smaller states, others see it as undermining the principle of one person, one vote. A practical compromise is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce mismatches between the popular vote and the outcome through reforms such as expanding the House (and therefore electoral votes), adopting uniform standards for counting and recounts, and encouraging state-level allocation methods that better reflect voter preferences. These changes can preserve state roles in presidential elections while strengthening legitimacy, transparency, and public confidence in the result."
