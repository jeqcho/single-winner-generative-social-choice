    "While some see the Electoral College as protecting federalism and encouraging broad coalitions, others view it as undermining the principle that each vote should carry equal weight. A practical middle ground is to preserve the state-based framework but reduce outcomes that diverge from the national popular will by adopting reforms such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, proportional allocation of electors, or ranked-choice voting within states. These changes can improve legitimacy and voter confidence while maintaining incentives for candidates to compete across a wide range of communities and states.",
    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College protects federalism and small-state influence or undermines the principle of one person, one vote, many can agree the system should better reflect the national will without ignoring state-based concerns. A practical middle ground is to keep the Electoral College but adopt reforms that reduce winner-take-all distortions\u2014such as allocating electors proportionally or by congressional district, strengthening election administration standards, and improving transparency and recount procedures. If broader change is pursued, it should be phased in and paired with safeguards that preserve state roles and encourage candidates to compete nationwide rather than only in a handful of swing states.",
    "The Electoral College should be reformed in ways that preserve federalism and state voices while ensuring that every voter\u2019s ballot is counted fairly and that the winner reflects broad national support. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce distortions by adopting nonpartisan redistricting, requiring proportional or district-based allocation of electors with uniform national standards, and encouraging interstate agreements that align outcomes more closely with the national vote. These changes can address concerns about legitimacy and \u201cswing-state\u201d bias without requiring an immediate, all-or-nothing shift to a national popular vote.",
    "While some see the Electoral College as protecting federalism and smaller states\u2019 influence and others view it as undermining the principle of one person, one vote, many can agree the system should better reflect the national popular will while preserving state-based administration of elections. A practical middle ground is to keep the Electoral College but reduce winner-take-all outcomes through proportional or district-based allocation of electors and adopt uniform, transparent standards for recounts, audits, and voter access. If states choose, they could also coordinate through agreements that align electoral votes with the national popular vote once broad participation is reached, ensuring legitimacy and stability across close elections.",
    "While some Americans favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and state influence and others want a direct national popular vote, there is room for reforms that strengthen legitimacy and voter confidence without erasing states\u2019 roles. A pragmatic approach would make outcomes track the national will more closely by reducing winner-take-all rules through proportional or district-based allocation, paired with a uniform national standard for recounts and election administration. These changes could narrow the gap between the popular vote and the final result while maintaining the Constitution\u2019s state-centered framework and encouraging broad, cross-regional coalitions."
