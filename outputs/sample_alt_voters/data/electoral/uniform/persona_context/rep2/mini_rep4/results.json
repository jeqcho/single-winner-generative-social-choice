A workable bridge is to require each state to allocate electors by the statewide vote share (with a small threshold to avoid extreme fragmentation) and to legally bind electors to certified results, alongside minimum national rules for voter access, paper records, audits, and uniform recount triggers. If the country later wants to go further, an opt-in path like the National Popular Vote compact could be used only once participation is broad and the governance and dispute-resolution rules are clearly defined.",

A practical bridge is to phase in a National Popular Vote Interstate Compact with ranked-choice voting so the winner earns majority support, with proportional allocation of electors as a workable fallback if the compact lacks broad, durable participation. Either path should include clear national baselines for ballot access, paper-backed audits, secure chain-of-custody, and automatic recount triggers, and require electors to follow the certified results so close contests are verifiable and widely accepted.",

A practical consensus reform is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (with anti-gerrymandering safeguards if districts are used) and to bind electors to the certified vote. Pair that with uniform national baselines for ballot access, paper-backed audits, chain-of-custody, and automatic recount triggers. If broad agreement develops later, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact could be a further step, ideally alongside ranked-choice voting to ensure the winner has majority support.",
