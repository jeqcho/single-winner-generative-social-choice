Any change should be paired with uniform baseline standards for ballot access and counting, secure paper records, routine risk-limiting audits, and clear rules binding electors to certified results. Implement reforms gradually and transparently, with nonpartisan safeguards (including fair districting where districts are used), so campaigns compete beyond a handful of swing states and the results are clear and broadly trusted.",

A practical compromise is to encourage states to award electors proportionally (or by district with clear anti\u2011gerrymandering rules) and to consider an interstate compact as a voluntary path toward a popular\u2011vote outcome, paired with binding electors to certified results. Any change should come with clear, uniform minimum standards for registration, ballot access, paper backups, and routine audits and recounts, phased in transparently to build trust across rural, suburban, and urban communities.",
