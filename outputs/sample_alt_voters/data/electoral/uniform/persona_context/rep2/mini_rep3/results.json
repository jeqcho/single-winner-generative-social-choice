A practical bridge is to require proportional (or carefully designed district-based, anti-gerrymandered) allocation of electors, with electors legally bound to the result, and to consider a majority-winner safeguard like ranked-choice voting. Whatever model is chosen, uniform national baselines for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and clear automatic recount triggers would make close elections more transparent, calm, and trusted.",

A practical compromise is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors, while binding electors to the certified vote and using an independent, nonpartisan method to draw any district lines if states choose a district-based option. Pair this with clear national baselines for ballot access, multilingual voter information, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races, and consider ranked-choice voting or a runoff to ensure the winner has majority support.",
