To rebuild trust, Congress should set clear national baselines for ballot access, paper audit trails, chain-of-custody, and automatic recount rules, while leaving day-to-day administration to states. If experience shows these reforms still produce frequent popular-vote/elector mismatches, the country could then consider a national popular-vote solution with a majority requirement (ranked-choice or a runoff) as a next step.",

If the country wants to move further toward one person, one vote, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting or a majority runoff\u2014can align outcomes with the national will while ensuring the winner earns broad support.",

A broadly workable reform is to keep state-run elections but replace winner-take-all with proportional (or carefully designed district-based) elector allocation and bind electors to the certified vote, so fewer voters feel ignored and campaigns compete in more places.
