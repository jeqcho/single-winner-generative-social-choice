A pragmatic path is to move away from winner-take-all by adopting proportional or district-based elector allocation, with a carefully phased National Popular Vote compact as an option only if clear, nationwide standards for access, counting, paper records, audits, and recounts are in place. Pairing these changes with transparent, nonpartisan administration and, where states choose, ranked-choice ballots can reduce swing-state distortions, encourage broad coalition-building, and rebuild trust in outcomes.",
