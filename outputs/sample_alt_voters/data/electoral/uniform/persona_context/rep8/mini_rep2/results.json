If there is sufficient public buy-in, states could also adopt a carefully designed popular-vote compact or ranked-choice ballots to ensure winners have broad support without forcing an abrupt constitutional overhaul.",

A bridging reform is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors, and to consider the National Popular Vote compact only alongside clear, bipartisan national standards for voter access, secure paper ballots, routine risk-limiting audits, and transparent recount triggers. States could also adopt ranked-choice voting for president where feasible to ensure majority support and reduce spoiler concerns, with changes phased in and paired with strong public education so the system remains stable and easy to trust.",
