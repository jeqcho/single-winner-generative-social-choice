A practical path is to end winner-take-all by using proportional elector allocation (or joining the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once enough states participate), while requiring electors to follow certified results. To build confidence across generations and communities, add clear nationwide baseline standards for ballot access (including language assistance), paper records, post-election audits, and automatic recount triggers so close elections are transparent and credible.",
