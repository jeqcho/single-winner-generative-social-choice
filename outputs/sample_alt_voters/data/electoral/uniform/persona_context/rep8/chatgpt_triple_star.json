    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve state influence and others prefer a direct national popular vote, many can agree the system should better reflect voters\u2019 choices while maintaining confidence in close outcomes. A practical middle ground is to strengthen nationwide election standards and transparency, and encourage states to allocate electors proportionally or by ranked-choice results rather than winner-take-all, reducing mismatches between the national vote and the outcome. These reforms would preserve a federal role for states while making results feel fairer and more representative across the country."
