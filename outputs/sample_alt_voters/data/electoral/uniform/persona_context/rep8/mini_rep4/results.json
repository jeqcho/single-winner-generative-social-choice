States could be encouraged (or required) to allocate electors by district with a small statewide bonus, or proportionally, while adopting uniform national baselines for voter access, paper-backed audits, automatic recount triggers, and enforceable rules that electors follow certified results. If repeated mismatches between the popular vote and the Electoral College persist under these improvements, a phased National Popular Vote compact can serve as a backstop once it commands broad bipartisan and geographic buy-in.",

A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally in every state and requiring electors to follow certified results; if misalignments persist, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be a lawful next step once enough states join.
