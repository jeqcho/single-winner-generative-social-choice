This keeps campaigns incentivized to build geographically broad support, makes results easier to verify and accept, and gives voters in every state a clearer stake in the outcome.",

A practical compromise is proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors, binding electors to the certified result, and clear national baseline standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers applied consistently in every state. Where feasible, adding ranked-choice voting can encourage broader coalitions and reduce incentives for swing-state brinkmanship, making close results easier to accept.",

To make the outcome credible and easier to accept, require electors to follow the certified results and set clear national baseline standards for ballot access, voter ID/verification options, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races. These reforms preserve federalism and smaller-state visibility while making the final result track the voters more closely and giving people in every state a reason to believe their vote matters.",
