A pragmatic path is to encourage proportional or district-based allocation of electors and allow a carefully phased National Popular Vote compact only alongside uniform, transparent national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts. Electors should be legally bound to certified results, and states should be free to adopt ranked-choice voting or runoff-style safeguards to ensure the winner earns broad majority support and public confidence.",

A practical compromise is to encourage states to move away from winner-take-all toward proportional or district-based elector allocation, while allowing a carefully phased interstate compact to align the outcome with the national popular vote once shared safeguards are in place. Alongside any allocation change, adopt uniform baseline rules for ballot access, timely counting, routine risk-limiting audits and recount procedures, and binding electors to certified results; where states choose, ranked-choice voting can help produce a clear majority winner.",
