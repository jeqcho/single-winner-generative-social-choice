    "While some Americans value the Electoral College for balancing state and regional interests and others favor a direct national popular vote, there is shared interest in making presidential elections fair, transparent, and trusted. A pragmatic middle path is to keep the state-based framework but reduce mismatches between the popular vote and the outcome through reforms like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, alongside uniform standards for ballot access, recounts, and election security. These steps preserve federalism and local control while ensuring every vote carries more equal weight and the winner reflects broad national support.",
    "Many Americans value the Electoral College for promoting federalism and ensuring smaller states have a voice, while others want every vote to carry equal weight nationwide. A workable middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms\u2014such as allocating electors proportionally within states (or by congressional district with safeguards against gerrymandering), strengthening uniform election standards, and creating a clear national recount trigger\u2014to better align outcomes with the popular will. These steps preserve state roles and stability while reducing winner-take-all distortions and improving legitimacy across parties and regions.",
    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and smaller-state influence and others want direct popular election for equal voter weight, many Americans agree the system should better reflect the national will while maintaining confidence in the outcome. A workable middle ground is to keep the Electoral College framework but adopt reforms that reduce winner-take-all distortions and increase transparency\u2014such as encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors, standardizing election administration, and requiring timely post-election audits. If states choose, a carefully designed interstate compact could further align electoral votes with the national popular vote once broad participation is achieved, ensuring stability and broad legitimacy.",
    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and regional balance and others want a direct national popular vote for equal weighting of every ballot, most can agree the system should better reflect voter intent while maintaining stable, nationwide outcomes. A pragmatic path is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce misfires by adopting reforms like nationwide standards for ballot access and counting, ranked-choice voting within states, and awarding electors proportionally or via the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once broad participation is secured. These steps can increase legitimacy, competitiveness, and confidence in close elections without abruptly discarding the role of states in presidential selection.",
    "While Americans disagree on whether the Electoral College protects federalism or undermines majority rule, many share a goal of making presidential elections feel fair, transparent, and competitive in every state. A pragmatic middle ground is to keep a state-based role while aligning outcomes more closely with the national popular will\u2014through measures like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, proportional allocation of electors, or adopting ranked-choice voting within states. Paired with clearer nationwide standards for ballots, recounts, and election security, these reforms could reduce \u201cswing state\u201d distortion and preserve state influence without requiring an immediate constitutional overhaul."
