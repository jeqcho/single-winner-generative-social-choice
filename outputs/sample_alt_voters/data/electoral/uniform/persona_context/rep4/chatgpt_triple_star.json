    "Many Americans value the Electoral College for preserving a federal balance and encouraging broad coalitions, while others see it as undermining the principle that every vote should carry equal weight. A workable middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms that better align outcomes with the national popular will\u2014such as expanding voter access, using nonpartisan districting, and allocating electors in ways that reduce winner-take-all distortions. These changes could make elections feel fairer and more representative without requiring an immediate, high-risk overhaul of the system."
