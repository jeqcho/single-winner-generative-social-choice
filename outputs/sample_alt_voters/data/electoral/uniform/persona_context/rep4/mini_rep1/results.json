If states can agree on common eligibility, ballot design, counting timelines, and risk-limiting audits, an interstate compact that delivers the national popular-vote winner could be triggered only once those safeguards and a broad participation threshold are met. Pairing these changes with a majority-producing method such as ranked-choice voting would reduce spoiler dynamics, expand campaigning beyond a few battlegrounds, and make close results easier to accept.",

A practical path is to expand proportional or district-based allocation of electors, with the National Popular Vote interstate compact as an optional, phased step once widely adopted and paired with clear safeguards. Any changes should include binding electors to the voters\u2019 outcome, uniform standards for ballot access, counting, audits and recounts, and transparent, secure procedures to strengthen legitimacy and reduce litigation.",
