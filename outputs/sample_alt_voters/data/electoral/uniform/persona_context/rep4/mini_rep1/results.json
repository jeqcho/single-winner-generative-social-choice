A strong middle-ground step is to require electors to be awarded by a consistent formula in every state (such as proportional by statewide vote with a small threshold) and to bind electors to certified results, so outcomes track real vote margins without forcing an immediate constitutional overhaul. Pair that with national guardrails\u2014paper ballots or voter-verifiable records, routine risk-limiting audits, and uniform recount and certification timelines\u2014so close elections are resolved transparently and peacefully. If broad agreement grows, states can still choose to converge on a national popular-vote outcome through an interstate compact, but only after those integrity standards are in place.",

A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation of electors (with electors bound to the certified result), paired with nationwide baselines for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and clear automatic recount triggers. For those who prefer a clearer \u201cone person, one vote\u201d outcome, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a step-by-step path once it reaches 270, while encouraging candidates to compete beyond a few battleground states.",
