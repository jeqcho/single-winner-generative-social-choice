A workable compromise is to keep the state-based system but require electors to follow the state\u2019s voters, encourage proportional or district-based allocation of electors (or a carefully triggered national popular-vote compact only after broad adoption), and set clear, uniform rules for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers.
