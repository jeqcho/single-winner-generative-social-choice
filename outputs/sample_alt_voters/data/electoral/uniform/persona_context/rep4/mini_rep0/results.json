If states want to go further, a National Popular Vote compact or ranked-choice ballots can be adopted gradually and only with clear, transparent rules so campaigns broaden beyond a few battlegrounds and outcomes are easier to accept across regions.",

States could move to proportional (or district-based with a statewide component) elector allocation and require electors to follow the certified vote, paired with clear, uniform rules for ballot access, timely counting, audits, and recounts to strengthen trust. If a national popular-vote approach is pursued, it should be phased in only with broad bipartisan adoption and strong integrity safeguards, with optional ranked-choice voting where states want it to ensure majority support.",
