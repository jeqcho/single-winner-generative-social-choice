States could award electoral votes using a uniform, nonpartisan proportional formula with a small statewide bonus for the top finisher, while requiring electors to follow certified results and using consistent national baselines for ballot access, paper records, audits, and recount triggers. This preserves a federal role and regional incentives, but makes campaigns compete for votes everywhere and reduces the chance that the Electoral College diverges from the public\u2019s choice.",

Build legitimacy with clear national baselines: paper-backed ballots, transparent post\u2011election audits, consistent automatic recount triggers, and electors legally bound to certified results.

A broad compromise is to keep the Electoral College but end winner\u2011take\u2011all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (with strong safeguards against gerrymandering if any district method is used), and to bind electors to certified results. Pair this with clear national baseline rules\u2014secure paper records, transparent risk\u2011limiting audits, and automatic recount triggers\u2014so close outcomes are verifiable and trusted, and allow the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact as an optional, step\u2011by\u2011step path if states prefer a clearer popular\u2011vote outcome over time.",
