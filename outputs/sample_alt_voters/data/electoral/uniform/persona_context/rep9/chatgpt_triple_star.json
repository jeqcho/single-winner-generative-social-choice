    "A constructive path forward is to keep the Electoral College\u2019s role in requiring broad, cross-state support while reforming it to better reflect the popular will and ensure every vote is counted fairly. Reforms could include adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or a proportional allocation of electors, combined with uniform election standards and automatic recount triggers in close races. This approach acknowledges concerns about protecting smaller states\u2019 influence while addressing widely shared goals of legitimacy, transparency, and voter equality."
