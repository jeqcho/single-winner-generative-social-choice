A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (with binding electors), paired with clear national baselines for ballot access, auditable paper trails, risk-limiting audits, and automatic recount thresholds to handle close races transparently. Where broader alignment is desired without a constitutional overhaul, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a voluntary on-ramp once those integrity standards are in place, and ranked-choice voting for president can reduce spoiler fears and reward coalition-building.",

A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state (with electors bound to certified results), or using the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact as a voluntary transition where states prefer it. Whichever path is chosen should include clear nationwide baselines for ballot access, paper-backed counting, transparent post-election audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races. Where states are willing, ranked-choice voting for president can ensure the winner has majority-style support and reduce spoiler fears without changing who runs elections.",
