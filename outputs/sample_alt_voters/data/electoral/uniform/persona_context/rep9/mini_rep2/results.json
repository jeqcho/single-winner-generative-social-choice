If the country later wants to move closer to a pure national tally, it should do so only after those integrity standards are in place so the rules stay simple, verifiable, and trusted across regions.",

Pair this with clear national baselines for ballots, paper-backed audits, binding electors to the certified vote, and automatic recount triggers so close results are transparent and trusted. If the country later wants to align even more directly with the national popular will, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a gradual, workable next step rather than an abrupt overhaul.",

A workable middle path is to end winner-take-all and require proportional allocation of electors in every state, with electors bound to the vote, plus clear national baselines for ballot access, paper records, audits, and automatic recount triggers. If the country wants the winner to match the national vote more directly, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (and optional ranked-choice voting) can be phased in with the same transparency and safeguards.",
