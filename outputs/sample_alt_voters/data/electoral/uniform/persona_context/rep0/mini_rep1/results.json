Congress and the states could replace winner-take-all with a uniform district-plus-proportional method (e.g., two electors to the statewide winner, the rest by statewide vote share) and require electors to follow certified results, backed by consistent national rules for ballot access, paper records, audits, and automatic recount thresholds. If repeated mismatches between the popular vote and the outcome persist, a widely adopted popular-vote compact could serve as a clear, pre-committed backstop without forcing an immediate constitutional amendment.",

A strong middle-ground is to require proportional allocation of electors in every state and bind electors to the certified popular vote, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, transparent counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races. If broader buy-in develops, a carefully designed National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a phased backstop so the presidency aligns more consistently with the national popular will without a sudden constitutional overhaul.",

The broadest bridge is to require proportional allocation of electors in every state and bind electors to the certified results, while adopting clear national minimum standards for ballot access, auditable counting, and automatic recount triggers in close races. If confidence grows over time, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a phased step toward aligning the presidency with the national popular vote, paired with simple safeguards (like a clear recount/runoff rule) to avoid chaos and litigation.",
