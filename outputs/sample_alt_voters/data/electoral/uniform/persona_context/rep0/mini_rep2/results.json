A workable middle path is to keep the Electoral College but require every state to award electors based on actual vote shares (with a small minimum threshold) and to legally bind electors to the certified result, so fewer votes are effectively \u201cwasted\u201d and campaigns have incentives beyond a few battlegrounds. To reduce disputes, Congress should set uniform baseline rules for ballot access, post\u2011election audits, recount triggers, and deadlines, while leaving states flexibility in how they administer elections. If the country later prefers a direct national popular vote, it should be paired with a majority requirement (ranked-choice or runoff) to ensure the winner has a clear mandate.",

A practical reform is to end winner\u2011take\u2011all by allocating electors proportionally in every state, require electors to follow the certified result, and adopt clear nationwide standards for ballot access, audits, recount triggers, and deadlines to reduce litigation and chaos in close races. If broader agreement develops over time, a carefully designed National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014with uniform safeguards and a simple runoff or ranked\u2011choice option\u2014can be a phased path toward ensuring the winner reflects a true national majority.",

A practical, constitutional step is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with a proportional statewide adjustment), require electors to follow the certified vote, and adopt clear nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers to reduce litigation and boost trust. If a broader shift is pursued later, it should be phased in through a widely accepted mechanism such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, with uniform rules and an instant-runoff/ranked-choice option so the winner has a clear majority mandate.",
