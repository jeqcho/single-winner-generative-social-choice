A realistic compromise is to replace winner-take-all with a uniform method that awards electors proportionally (with a modest threshold to avoid extreme fragmentation) and to require electors to follow the certified outcome. Pair that with nationwide baseline rules for ballot design, chain-of-custody, risk-limiting audits, and automatic recount triggers so close elections are resolved consistently and credibly. If the country later seeks an even closer link to the national popular vote, it should be phased in with clear safeguards and broad bipartisan buy-in.",

End winner-take-all by moving states toward proportional allocation of electors and require electors to follow the certified state result, paired with clear national standards for ballots, audits, and recount triggers so close races are verifiable and trusted. As broader consensus develops, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014and tools like ranked-choice voting or an automatic runoff\u2014can be phased in to reduce spoiler concerns and ensure the winner earns broad support.",

A workable compromise is for states to allocate electors proportionally (or by a consistent district method) with electors legally bound to the certified result, while Congress sets clear, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recount triggers so close races are verifiable and less likely to end in lawsuits. If the country later builds broad agreement for a national popular-vote outcome (such as through an interstate compact), include a simple runoff or ranked-choice backstop so the winner reflects broad support and the rules remain easy to explain and trust.",
