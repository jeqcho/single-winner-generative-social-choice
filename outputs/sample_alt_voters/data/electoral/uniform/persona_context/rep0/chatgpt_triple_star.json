    "While some Americans favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve the role of states and smaller communities, others prefer a more direct reflection of the national popular vote. A practical middle ground is to retain the Electoral College but modernize it by expanding the House to rebalance representation, reducing winner-take-all rules through proportional or district-based allocation, and strengthening uniform election standards. These reforms would respect federalism while making outcomes more representative and improving public confidence in close elections.",
    "The Electoral College can be improved in ways that respect federalism and state influence while better reflecting the will of voters. A pragmatic middle ground is to keep the current constitutional framework but adopt reforms such as nationwide minimum standards for election administration, expanding ranked-choice or proportional allocation of electors within states, and requiring the winner to secure a broad national mandate (e.g., via an automatic recount threshold or a runoff mechanism). These steps preserve the role of states and encourage coalition-building, while reducing incentives to focus only on a handful of swing states and increasing confidence that outcomes align with voter preferences.",
    "While opinions differ on whether the Electoral College protects federalism or undermines majority rule, most people want elections that are fair, transparent, and trusted. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions by encouraging proportional allocation of electors, strengthening uniform election standards, and ensuring the national popular vote strongly influences outcomes. Reforms should be phased in with bipartisan safeguards so both small and large states retain a meaningful voice while the winner more consistently reflects the will of the voters.",
    "While some view the Electoral College as an important federalist safeguard and others see it as outdated and undemocratic, a practical middle ground is to preserve its role while reducing incentives for \"winner-take-all\" outcomes. States could adopt reforms such as proportional allocation or ranked-choice-based allocation of electors, combined with uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, and post-election audits to strengthen legitimacy. If these steps still fail to reflect broad voter preferences over time, a clearly defined, bipartisan process could evaluate a more fundamental change, ensuring any transition maintains stability and broad public consent.",
    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and protect smaller states and others prefer a direct popular vote, a workable middle ground is to modernize the system so it better reflects the will of voters while retaining a role for states. Reforms could include adopting uniform standards for elections, awarding electors proportionally within states, and supporting an interstate compact or constitutional amendment that ensures the national popular-vote winner prevails once broad geographic support is demonstrated. This approach aims to increase legitimacy and fairness, reduce the impact of a few swing states, and maintain incentives for candidates to compete across the country."
