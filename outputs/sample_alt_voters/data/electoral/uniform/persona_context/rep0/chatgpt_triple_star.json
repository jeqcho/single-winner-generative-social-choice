    "While opinions differ on whether the Electoral College should be retained or replaced, most people share a goal of elections that are fair, trusted, and make every vote matter. A workable middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms that broaden representation and legitimacy\u2014such as expanding the House (and thus electoral votes), using nonpartisan redistricting, and encouraging states to allocate electors by a proportional or district-based method with uniform, transparent standards. These steps preserve federal-state balance valued by supporters while reducing \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions and improving national confidence for critics."
