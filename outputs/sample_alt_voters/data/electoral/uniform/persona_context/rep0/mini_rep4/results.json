If the public later prefers a stronger popular\u2011vote link, a carefully defined interstate agreement or runoff/RCV layer could be added to ensure the winner has broad, widely accepted legitimacy.",

A practical, widely compatible step is for states to allocate electors proportionally (or by district plus statewide) and to legally bind electors to the certified results. Pair this with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, transparent audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races so outcomes are timely, verifiable, and widely trusted. If broader agreement develops, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be phased in under the same uniform integrity rules to better align outcomes with the national popular will.",

A strong middle-ground package is to replace winner-take-all with proportional allocation of electors in every state, require electors to follow the certified vote, and adopt clear national baselines for ballot access, auditable counting, and automatic recount triggers in close races. If the country later seeks closer alignment with the national popular vote, it should be phased in through broad agreement (such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact) with simple, consistent rules and a runoff or ranked-choice option to ensure the winner has broad support.",
