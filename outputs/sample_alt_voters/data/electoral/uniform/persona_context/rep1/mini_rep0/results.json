A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally in every state, require electors to be bound to the certified result, and set clear national baselines for ballot access, paper-auditable counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers. If broad, durable buy-in develops, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014ideally paired with ranked-choice voting to reduce spoiler fears\u2014can be a transparent next step toward aligning the outcome with the national popular will without inviting chaotic close-race disputes.",

Pair that with clear national minimum standards for accessible voting, paper-auditable ballots, transparent audits, and automatic recount triggers so close outcomes are trusted and not litigated into chaos.
