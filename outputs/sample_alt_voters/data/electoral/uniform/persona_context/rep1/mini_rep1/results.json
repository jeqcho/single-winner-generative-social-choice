States could adopt a uniform default of allocating electors by proportional vote (with a small, clear threshold) and allow a ranked-choice national tally if no candidate reaches a majority, while also legally binding electors to certified results. In parallel, enact baseline nationwide rules for voter access, paper-backed tabulation, risk-limiting audits, and predictable recount triggers so outcomes are consistent, transparent, and widely accepted.",
