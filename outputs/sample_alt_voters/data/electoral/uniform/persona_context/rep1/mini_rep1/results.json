Electors should be legally bound to certified results, and Congress should set baseline national rules for ballot access, transparent post-election audits, and automatic recount procedures so close contests don\u2019t devolve into inconsistent state-by-state fights. If the country later decides to move to a national popular-vote outcome, it should happen only with clearly defined recount and governance safeguards to preserve legitimacy and stability.",

If broad, bipartisan buy-in develops, a carefully bounded National Popular Vote compact and/or ranked-choice voting could be a later step to further align the result with the popular will while encouraging cross-regional coalition-building.",
