A practical, phased path would encourage proportional (or carefully designed district) allocation of electors, require electors to follow certified state results, and set clear national baseline standards for ballot access, secure paper-based counting, routine audits, and transparent recount triggers. States may also consider tools like ranked-choice voting and, where supported, an interstate popular-vote compact, but only alongside these integrity and fairness safeguards. Changes should be simple, transparent, and implemented gradually to protect smaller and rural communities and strengthen public trust.",

Any change should come with clear nationwide baselines for voter access, secure paper-backed ballots, routine post-election audits, and transparent recount triggers so outcomes are trusted. Reforms should be phased in and evaluated over several cycles to preserve stability while giving candidates incentives to compete in more places than a handful of battlegrounds.",
