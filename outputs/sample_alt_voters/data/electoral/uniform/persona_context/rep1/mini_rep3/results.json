If that system still produces repeated popular-vote mismatches, the country could then consider the National Popular Vote compact or a constitutional update with clearer rules and fewer incentives for post-election litigation.",

A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation of electors nationwide, bind electors to the certified result, and adopt clear national baselines for ballot access, paper-based audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races. As confidence grows, states could consider a carefully designed National Popular Vote compact and ranked-choice voting to reduce spoiler fears and encourage broader, cross-regional coalition-building.",

A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all nationwide by allocating electors proportionally (with an option for states to use a consistent, non-gerrymandered district method), and to bind electors to the certified result. Pair that with clear national baseline standards for ballot access and language assistance, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers so close races are resolved by transparent rules rather than lawsuits. If these steps work well and public support grows, the National Popular Vote compact or a constitutional update\u2014potentially alongside ranked-choice voting\u2014can be considered to further align outcomes with the popular will.",
