    "While some Americans favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and the influence of smaller states, others want reforms that better reflect the national popular will and reduce disparities between voters. A practical middle ground is to retain the Electoral College but modernize it through nationally uniform election standards, expanded access to voting, and proportional allocation of electors (or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact) to better align outcomes with the popular vote while maintaining state roles. These steps can improve legitimacy, competitiveness across more states, and public confidence without requiring an immediate, high-risk constitutional overhaul."
