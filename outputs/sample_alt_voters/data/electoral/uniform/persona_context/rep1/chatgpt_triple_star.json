    "A pragmatic path forward is to preserve the Electoral College\u2019s role in reflecting federalism while reforming it to better align outcomes with the national popular will and strengthen trust in elections. This could include adopting uniform national standards for ballot access and counting, expanding state-level winner-allocation reforms such as ranked-choice or proportional allocation, and supporting an interstate compact approach only if it includes clear safeguards and broad buy-in. These steps respect concerns about regional representation and close-election stability while addressing the desire for greater democratic legitimacy and fewer \u201cmisfires\u201d between the popular vote and the presidency.",
    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College protects federalism and smaller states or distorts the principle of one person, one vote, most can agree the goal is a presidential election that is both fair and broadly legitimate. A workable middle path is to keep the state-based role in choosing the president but adopt reforms\u2014such as awarding electors proportionally within states or through multi-district allocation, strengthening national standards for voting access and recounts, and reducing incentives to focus only on a few swing states. These steps would preserve state influence while making outcomes better reflect the national electorate and increasing confidence across regions and parties.",
    "A practical middle ground is to keep the Electoral College\u2019s role in balancing state and national interests, while reforming it to better reflect the popular will and strengthen public trust. That could include adopting uniform statewide popular-vote allocation with ranked-choice ballots, expanding automatic recount and audit standards, and ensuring electors are legally bound to their state\u2019s results. These steps preserve federalism concerns for smaller states while addressing fairness and legitimacy concerns voiced by advocates of a national popular vote.",
    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College should be preserved, reformed, or replaced, there is broad shared interest in making presidential elections feel fair, competitive, and legitimate to voters in every state. A practical middle ground is to keep the federal, state-based structure but modernize it by reducing winner-take-all outcomes, strengthening uniform voting standards, and adopting reforms that better align electoral votes with the popular will while maintaining clear, timely results. This approach respects concerns about protecting smaller states\u2019 influence and state autonomy while addressing worries about democratic representation and close-election legitimacy.",
    "Many Americans value the Electoral College for preserving federalism and encouraging broad, cross-state coalitions, while others worry it can conflict with the principle that every vote should carry equal weight. A pragmatic middle path is to keep the state-based structure but reduce distortions by expanding the House (and thus electoral votes), adopting uniform national standards for ballot access and vote counting, and encouraging states to allocate electors proportionally or via an interstate compact once a clear national-vote threshold is met. This approach respects the Constitution\u2019s federal design while making outcomes more consistently reflect the electorate and improving legitimacy across parties."
