Pairing these steps with clearer, routine post\u2011election verification and optional ranked\u2011choice voting where states choose can make outcomes easier to accept and push campaigns to compete across more communities.",

Pair structural changes with uniform baseline standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers so results are transparent, verifiable, and less prone to litigation.

States should reduce winner-take-all incentives by moving toward proportional or district-based elector allocation and allowing ranked-choice voting where it fits, while any move toward a national popular-vote outcome should occur only with clear, shared rules. Establish uniform baseline standards for ballot access, counting, routine post-election audits, and automatic recount triggers so every community can trust the process.
