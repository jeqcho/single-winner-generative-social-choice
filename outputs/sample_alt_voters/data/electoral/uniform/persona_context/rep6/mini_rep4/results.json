Whatever path is chosen should include clear baseline standards for ballot access, certification timelines, transparent audits, and automatic recount thresholds to make results easier to verify and harder to dispute.",

Any changes should be phased in and paired with uniform baseline rules for ballot access, transparent post-election audits, and clear recount/certification standards so results are simple to administer, verifiable, and widely trusted.",
