Congress and states should move away from winner-take-all by awarding electors based on the statewide vote share with a clear, uniform national rulebook for voter access, secure ballot handling, risk-limiting audits, and timely recounts. Electors should be legally bound to the certified results, and states could adopt a popular-vote compact as a backstop once it guarantees a consistent, nationwide outcome.",

A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once enough states join), so campaigns have reason to compete beyond a handful of swing states. Pair that with clear national baselines for ballot access, secure counting, transparent audits, and automatic recount triggers so close results are consistent, verifiable, and widely trusted.",
