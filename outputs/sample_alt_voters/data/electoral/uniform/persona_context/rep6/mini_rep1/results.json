A strong compromise is to require states to award electors in a way that reflects their in\u2011state vote shares (with safeguards against gerrymandering if districts are used), while also adopting uniform, public standards for voter access, counting, audits, and automatic recounts. That preserves regional influence and stability, makes more votes matter in more places, and reduces the risk that close elections devolve into confusing, state-by-state rule fights.",

A practical middle path is to keep state-run elections but replace winner\u2011take\u2011all with proportional allocation of electors (with an option to phase in the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it reaches a clear threshold), while requiring uniform nationwide baselines for ballot access, transparent post\u2011election audits, and automatic recount triggers.

A practical reform is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors in every state (with an option to transition via the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it reaches a clear, durable threshold). Pair that with uniform national baselines for ballot access, secure counting, post-election audits, and automatic recount triggers so close races are handled consistently and working voters, rural communities, and urban communities alike can trust the outcome.",
