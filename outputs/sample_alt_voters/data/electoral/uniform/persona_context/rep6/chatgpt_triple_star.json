    "A balanced approach is to keep the Electoral College\u2019s role in reflecting state-based interests while ensuring the national popular will is more consistently honored. Reforms like allocating electors proportionally, expanding access to voting, and adopting uniform standards for counting and recounts could reduce distortions without requiring a complete constitutional overhaul. These changes acknowledge concerns about small-state influence and regional balance while addressing worries that the current system can produce outcomes seen as unfair or destabilizing."
