    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College should be abolished or preserved, many can agree the system should better reflect the will of voters while maintaining confidence across states. A pragmatic path is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms that reduce winner-take-all distortions\u2014such as proportional allocation within states, ranked-choice voting, or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with clear national standards for ballot access, recounts, and election security. These changes aim to make outcomes feel more legitimate and representative without forcing an abrupt overhaul that some states fear could diminish their voice.",
    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College should be preserved, reformed, or replaced, many share goals of ensuring every voter\u2019s voice matters, maintaining political stability, and encouraging broad national support. A pragmatic middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but modernize outcomes through reforms that reduce distortions\u2014such as expanding the use of proportional allocation within states, adopting ranked-choice voting where feasible, and creating clear, uniform election standards. Any changes should be phased in with bipartisan oversight and transparency, balancing populous and smaller-state concerns while making results more closely reflect the national vote.",
    "The Electoral College raises legitimate concerns about fairness and representation, but many also value its role in balancing the influence of smaller states and encouraging broad, national coalitions. A reasonable path forward is to preserve state-based administration while reducing outcomes that diverge from the national popular vote through reforms like expanding the House (and thus electoral votes), adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact where feasible, and encouraging states to use ranked-choice or district-based allocation with strong uniform standards. These steps would improve legitimacy and competitiveness without requiring an immediate, all-or-nothing constitutional overhaul.",
    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College should be preserved or replaced, many share goals of making presidential elections fair, legitimate, and reflective of voters across both large and small states. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms\u2014such as expanding the House to reduce distortion, standardizing election administration, and encouraging states to allocate electors in ways that more closely track the popular vote\u2014while maintaining protections for regional diversity. These steps can reduce mismatches between the popular and electoral outcomes without ignoring concerns about federalism and the influence of less-populated states.",
    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College should be preserved or replaced, many can agree the goal is to make presidential elections both fair and broadly legitimate across states and voters. A practical middle-ground approach is to keep the state-based structure but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with national standards for voting access and transparent recount procedures. These reforms would make outcomes track the popular will more closely while still respecting federalism and the role of states in the process."
