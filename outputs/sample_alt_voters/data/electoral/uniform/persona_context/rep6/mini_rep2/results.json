At the same time, adopt shared baseline standards for voter access, ballot counting, audits, and automatic recount thresholds so outcomes are verifiable, consistent, and widely accepted.",

Pair these steps with baseline national rules for ballot access, secure ID/verification options, transparent post\u2011election audits, and automatic recount thresholds so results are easier to verify and accept.
