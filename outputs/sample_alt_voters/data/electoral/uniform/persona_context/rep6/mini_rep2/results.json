A broadly acceptable package would phase out winner-take-all (via proportional allocation or a uniform district method with anti-gerrymandering rules), and pair it with minimum nationwide standards for ballot access, post-election audits, recount triggers, and certification deadlines. If the country later wants the popular-vote winner guaranteed, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a voluntary backstop once those verification standards are in place. The aim is a system where campaigns compete in more places, outcomes are easier to validate, and losing sides can more readily accept the result.",

A practical compromise is proportional (or district-based with strong anti\u2011gerrymandering guardrails) allocation of electors nationwide, paired with clear, uniform national baselines for ballot access, secure counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers. If broader alignment is needed without an immediate constitutional overhaul, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a stepwise path once those verification standards are in place.",

A broadly workable reform is proportional (or district-based with strong anti-gerrymandering guardrails) allocation of electors, paired with clear national baseline rules for ballot access, chain-of-custody, audits, recount triggers, and certification deadlines.
