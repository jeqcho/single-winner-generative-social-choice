States could be required to allocate electors using a uniform proportional formula (with a small threshold to avoid extreme fragmentation), while a federal baseline sets clear rules for registration access, ballot verification, post-election audits, and automatic recount triggers. This keeps a real role for states and regional coalition-building, but makes campaigns compete in more places and makes it far rarer for the popular-vote winner to lose.",
