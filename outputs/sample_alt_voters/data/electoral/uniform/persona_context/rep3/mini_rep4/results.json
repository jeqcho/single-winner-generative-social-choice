A workable middle path is to keep the Electoral College but replace winner-take-all with a uniform, proportional allocation rule in every state, alongside national baseline standards for voter access, paper-backed tabulation, risk-limiting audits, and automatic recount thresholds. If proportional allocation still fails to track the popular will over time, states could adopt a clearly defined National Popular Vote compact as a trigger-based backstop, giving the system a stable off-ramp without sudden disruption.",

A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by allocating electoral votes proportionally in every state (with a National Popular Vote Interstate Compact as an optional backstop where adopted), so campaigns have incentives to compete beyond a few battlegrounds. Whichever allocation method is used, it should be paired with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, paper-backed tabulation, risk-limiting audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races to strengthen legitimacy across regions.",
