A practical, phased path is to allow proportional (or district\u2011based) allocation of electors and/or adopt an interstate compact that awards electors to the national popular\u2011vote winner once clear, shared rules are in place. Any reform should be paired with auditable paper ballots, uniform post\u2011election audits and recount triggers, consistent ballot\u2011access standards, and firm protections against faithless electors.
