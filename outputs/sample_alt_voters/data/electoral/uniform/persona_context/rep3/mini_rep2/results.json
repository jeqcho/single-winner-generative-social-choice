A workable compromise is to require each state to award electors in proportion to its statewide vote (with a small bonus for the statewide winner if needed for decisiveness), while setting national minimum standards for voter access, paper records, risk-limiting audits, and uniform recount and certification deadlines. This would make outcomes track the public\u2019s choice more closely, broaden campaigning beyond a few battlegrounds, and improve confidence that close elections are resolved by transparent rules rather than partisan improvisation.",

A workable middle path is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by moving to proportional allocation of electors (or adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact), so campaigns have reason to compete in every state, not just a few battlegrounds. Pair that with clear national baseline standards for ballot access (including language and disability accommodations), paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races to make results easier to verify and accept. Where states choose, ranked-choice voting or a runoff option can ensure the winner has broad support and reduce spoiler-driven distrust.",
