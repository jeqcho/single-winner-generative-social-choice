A workable compromise is to encourage states to adopt proportional or district-based elector allocation (with flexibility by state) while also keeping the option of a carefully conditioned National Popular Vote compact only if clear, uniform standards for voter access, paper audit trails, automatic recount triggers, and strong anti\u2013faithless elector rules are in place.
