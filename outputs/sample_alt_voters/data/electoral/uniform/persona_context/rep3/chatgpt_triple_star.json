    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve state influence and others want a direct national popular vote, a workable middle ground is to better align outcomes with voters while maintaining a meaningful role for states. Reforms like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, recounts, and election security, could reduce winner-take-all distortions and boost confidence. This approach preserves federalism and encourages broad campaigning, while making it less likely that the presidency diverges from the overall will of the electorate."
