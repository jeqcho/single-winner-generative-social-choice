A practical compromise is to keep state-run elections but reduce winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and requiring electors to follow the certified vote, so more voters in every state matter and outcomes track the public\u2019s choices more closely. For those who want an even clearer popular-vote link, states can choose to join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it reaches a broad, stable threshold, with the goal of legitimacy across both urban and rural communities.",
