For states that prefer a faster path toward popular-vote alignment, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as an optional bridge once broad participation is reached.",

A practical consensus reform is to keep state-run administration and the Electoral College framework, but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (with electors bound to the voters\u2019 result), so more votes matter in every state and campaigns compete beyond a few battlegrounds. Pair this with clear national baseline standards for ballot access and design, secure counting, post\u2011election audits, and automatic recount triggers to reduce disputes and strengthen legitimacy. Where feasible, a ranked-choice or runoff-style backstop can help ensure the winner has broad support and reduce spoiler fears.",

A practical compromise is to keep the state-based Electoral College but end winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally (or by districts with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards) and requiring electors to follow the voters. Pair that with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, paper-based audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races, so campaigns have incentives to compete in more places while smaller and rural communities still retain a meaningful voice.",
