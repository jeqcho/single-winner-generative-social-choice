If the country later wants a clearer \u201cone person, one vote\u201d guarantee, a national popular-vote trigger (such as an interstate compact) could serve as a backstop once those uniform safeguards are in place.",

Adopt clear national baseline standards for ballot access, secure and transparent counting, routine post-election audits, and automatic recount triggers so close races are settled by consistent rules instead of lawsuits. If mismatches between the electoral and popular winner persist and public support grows, use the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact as an incremental backstop so the overall result more reliably matches what voters chose nationwide.",

A practical reform is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (with strong anti-gerrymandering rules) and binding electors to the state vote, while setting clear national baseline standards for ballot access, secure counting, transparent audits, and automatic recount triggers. If the country still sees repeated mismatches between the Electoral College and the national vote, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014paired with ranked-choice voting to ensure broad support\u2014can serve as an incremental backstop that makes every vote count without dismissing smaller-state and rural concerns.",
