    "While some Americans want to keep the Electoral College to preserve federalism and protect smaller states, others favor a more direct system that better matches the national popular vote. A practical middle ground is to retain the Electoral College but adopt reforms that make outcomes more representative and transparent\u2014such as encouraging proportional allocation of electors within states, reducing winner-take-all incentives, and setting clear national standards for ballot access and recounts. These changes would preserve states\u2019 roles in presidential elections while strengthening legitimacy by narrowing the gap between the popular vote and the final result.",
    "Many Americans value the Electoral College\u2019s role in balancing state and national interests, while others want outcomes to track the national popular vote more closely. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce winner-take-all incentives by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors and adopting uniform election standards and automatic recount thresholds. These reforms would preserve federalism and state influence while making results more representative, transparent, and broadly trusted.",
    "While some Americans favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve the role of states and regional balance, others want reforms to better reflect the national popular will and ensure every vote carries similar weight. A pragmatic middle path is to keep the state-based framework but modernize it by requiring proportional allocation of electoral votes within states, strengthening nationwide election standards and access, and establishing a clear, widely accepted tiebreak and recount process. This approach maintains federalism and stability while reducing winner-take-all distortions and increasing confidence that presidential outcomes reflect broad, legitimate support.",
    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College should be kept, reformed, or replaced, many share the goal of ensuring every vote matters while preserving confidence in a stable, nationwide result. A practical middle ground is to retain the constitutional framework but adopt reforms that better align outcomes with the national popular will and reduce winner-take-all distortions\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors, clearer nationwide standards for voting access and counting, and greater transparency in certification. These changes can respect federalism and regional representation while addressing concerns about fairness, legitimacy, and incentives to campaign beyond a handful of swing states.",
    "While Americans disagree on whether the Electoral College protects federalism and small-state influence or undermines majority rule, many can agree the system should better reflect voters\u2019 choices and maintain confidence in outcomes. A practical middle ground is to keep the Electoral College framework but adopt reforms\u2014such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electors within states\u2014paired with uniform election standards and clearer rules for recounts and certification. These steps would reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions and incentive to ignore noncompetitive states, while preserving a state-based role in presidential elections and avoiding abrupt constitutional upheaval."
