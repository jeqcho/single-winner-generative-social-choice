    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College should be preserved, reformed, or replaced, many share a goal of making presidential elections both fairer and trusted across states and regions. A practical middle ground is to keep a federal, state-based role but reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors, setting consistent national standards for administration and recounts, and considering a popular-vote threshold or interstate compact to better align outcomes with the national vote. This approach respects federalism and smaller-state interests while increasing transparency, competitiveness, and confidence that every vote meaningfully counts."
