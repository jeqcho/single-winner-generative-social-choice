A practical reform is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or with a carefully designed district option), with electors bound to the vote and guardrails against gerrymandering. Pair this with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, accessible voting, transparent audits, and automatic recounts in very close races, and consider the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact as an incremental backstop if mismatches persist.",

Pair that with clear national baseline standards for voter access and disability accommodations, transparent audits, and automatic recount triggers in very close races, plus binding electors to the certified vote to avoid faithless-elector disputes. If a consistent mismatch between the electoral and popular winner persists, build bipartisan support for an incremental popular-vote backstop (such as the National Popular Vote compact) once the uniform standards are in place.",
