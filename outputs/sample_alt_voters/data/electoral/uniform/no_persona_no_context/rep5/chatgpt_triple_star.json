    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and encourage broad geographic coalitions, others argue it can misalign with the national popular will and weaken equal representation. A practical middle ground is to retain the state-based framework but adopt reforms that better align outcomes with voters\u2014such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it reliably reaches 270 electoral votes, or proportional/Ranked-Choice allocation of electors within states. Pairing any change with clear national standards for voting access, election security, and recount procedures can protect legitimacy while addressing concerns about fairness and representation."
