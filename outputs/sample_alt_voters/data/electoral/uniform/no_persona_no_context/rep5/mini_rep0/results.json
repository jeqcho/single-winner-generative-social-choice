A pragmatic compromise is to pair better election administration (uniform counting, recount, and certification rules) with state-by-state changes that reduce extreme outcomes, such as proportional elector allocation or ranked-choice within states. If those reforms don\u2019t improve legitimacy and campaign incentives over several cycles, the country can revisit larger shifts like a national popular vote through a clear, broadly supported process.",
