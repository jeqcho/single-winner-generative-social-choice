A workable compromise is to keep the Electoral College framework but reduce winner-take-all effects through a uniform proportional allocation rule (with clear minimum thresholds) and pair it with modernized House apportionment so representation better matches population. Alongside that, consistent national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers would lower the risk that close elections turn into legitimacy crises. This approach lets people compare reforms on fairness, simplicity, and nationwide campaign incentives without requiring an immediate constitutional overhaul.",

A practical middle path is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by moving toward proportional (or well-guarded district) allocation of electors and by expanding the House to better match population, while also adopting clearer, more uniform national standards for counting, recounts, and dispute resolution. In parallel, states can evaluate a compact-based route to a popular-vote outcome, judging each option by shared criteria like transparency, coalition-building incentives, and simplicity before the next close election.",
