Alongside these steps, states can seriously evaluate a coordinated compact approach to better align the final outcome with the national popular will without requiring an immediate all-or-nothing constitutional overhaul.",

A practical compromise is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions by moving to proportional (or carefully designed district) allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards, while also adopting clearer national standards for counting, recounts, and disputed results.
