A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions by moving toward proportional (or ranked-choice-based) allocation of electors within states, paired with clear national standards for recounts, ballot access, and limits on faithless electors. These changes can be phased in or piloted so we can measure whether they improve voter equality and legitimacy without creating new incentives to game the system.",
