A practical compromise is to keep state-run elections and the Electoral College framework, but reduce winner-take-all distortions by moving toward proportional elector allocation (or a carefully designed popular-vote compact), paired with clear nationwide baseline rules for ballot access, recount triggers, and elector certification.
