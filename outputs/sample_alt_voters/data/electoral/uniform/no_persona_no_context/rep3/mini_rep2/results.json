If those steps still leave persistent legitimacy gaps, a clearly defined \u201cpopular-vote backstop\u201d agreed to by participating states could be triggered only when the national margin is decisive, preserving stability while better reflecting the electorate.",

Options like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be evaluated alongside these reforms using shared criteria\u2014representation, stability, and incentives to campaign broadly\u2014rather than partisan advantage.",

A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions through proportional (or ranked-choice) allocation of electors within states, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, and recounts. We can also evaluate complementary steps\u2014like expanding the House to better match population and considering a popular-vote compact only if broad, bipartisan participation and clear recount rules are in place\u2014so reforms increase trust without making any region feel ignored.",
