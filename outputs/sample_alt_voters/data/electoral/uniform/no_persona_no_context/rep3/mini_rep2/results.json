Judging options by transparent criteria\u2014representation, predictability in close elections, and incentives to compete beyond swing states\u2014can help us choose changes that more voters across regions can accept.",

A workable middle path is to keep the Electoral College but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional (or carefully designed district-based) elector allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards, paired with clear national minimum standards for ballot access, counting, and recounts. We can also evaluate a trigger approach like the National Popular Vote compact only if it has broad, bipartisan participation and transparent recount rules, so results are trusted across regions. The goal is not to favor one party, but to make more votes matter in every state while keeping outcomes stable and widely accepted.",
