    "A constructive path forward is to preserve the Electoral College\u2019s role in balancing state and national interests while ensuring the presidency reflects broad public legitimacy. Reforms such as a uniform national standard for allocating electors (for example, proportional or district-based allocation), strengthened election administration, and a clear mechanism to align outcomes more closely with the national popular vote when discrepancies are large could address fairness concerns without fully abandoning federalism. This approach respects those who value state influence and stability while responding to those who seek a more directly representative result."
