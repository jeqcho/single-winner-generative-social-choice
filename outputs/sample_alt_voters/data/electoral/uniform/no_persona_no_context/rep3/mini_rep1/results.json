Alongside that, states could pilot non-winner-take-all methods (proportional or ranked-choice) so reforms are evaluated by clear metrics like competitiveness, reduced \u201cswing-state\u201d bias, and smoother close-election resolution.",

A practical compromise is to keep states administering elections and certifying electors, while reducing winner\u2011take\u2011all distortions through proportional (or fair district-based) allocation and stronger guardrails against gerrymandering and faithless electors. Pair that with uniform national standards for voting access, recount triggers, and audits so close elections are handled consistently. These steps can be evaluated side by side with the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or a constitutional amendment based on transparency, stability, and broad public trust.",

A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College but reduce winner-take-all by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation with anti-gerrymandering safeguards, paired with clear nationwide standards for ballot access, recounts, and limits on faithless electors. We can also consider steps like expanding the House or joining a popular-vote compact only if it includes transparent recount triggers, so reforms improve legitimacy without risking chaos in close elections.",
