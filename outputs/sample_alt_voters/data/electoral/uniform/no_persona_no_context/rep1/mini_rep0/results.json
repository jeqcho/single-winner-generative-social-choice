A practical bridge is to keep the Electoral College framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or ranked-choice allocation of electors within states, paired with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, counting, and recount triggers. At the same time, adjusting elector counts by expanding the House can reduce disparities without rewriting the Constitution, and any change should be judged by shared metrics\u2014public trust, competitiveness beyond a handful of swing states, and predictable rules everyone accepts before Election Day.",
