A pragmatic compromise is to keep the Electoral College but reduce distortions by setting baseline national rules for vote counting and recounts, and by making elector allocation more proportional to each state\u2019s vote rather than winner-take-all. Alongside that, adjusting the elector formula (such as expanding the House) could better align outcomes with population without erasing smaller states\u2019 influence. The test should be whether reforms increase legitimacy, make more campaigns competitive beyond a handful of states, and lower the risk of contested results.",
