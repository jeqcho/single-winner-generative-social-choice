A practical bridge is to keep the state-based framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation paired with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards. In parallel, adopt uniform national standards for ballot access, recount triggers, and post-election audits so close elections are clearer and more trusted. These steps can improve legitimacy and campaign incentives now while leaving room to evaluate larger changes like an interstate popular-vote compact or constitutional amendment later.",

A practical compromise is to keep the state-based Electoral College but reduce winner-take-all by moving toward proportional or district-based elector allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards, while also adopting clear national standards for voting access, audits, and recount triggers. We can also consider modernizing representation (such as expanding the House) to lessen unequal vote weight and test interstate approaches like the National Popular Vote compact only if they include robust integrity measures. Evaluating reforms against shared metrics\u2014fairness, stability, transparency, and coalition-building\u2014can lower suspicion that changes are meant to benefit one party.",
