States could shift from winner-take-all to a proportional (or proportional-with-threshold) allocation using statewide ranked-choice ballots, paired with independent redistricting if any district element is used, so campaigns must compete for votes everywhere. At the same time, Congress could set uniform national standards for ballots, audits, and recount triggers so close outcomes are transparent and consistently resolved.",

A practical middle path is to keep the state-based structure but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional (or district-based) elector allocation paired with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards. At the same time, setting clearer nationwide standards for recount triggers, audits, and election administration can boost confidence in close races. These incremental steps can improve legitimacy now while leaving room to evaluate larger options like an interstate popular-vote compact or a constitutional amendment based on agreed goals rather than partisan advantage.",

A practical bridge is to keep states administering elections while reducing winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional (or district-based) elector allocation paired with strong anti-gerrymandering rules, and adopting clear national standards for ballots, audits, and recount triggers. We can also consider steps that improve representation\u2014like expanding the House\u2014so electoral votes track population more closely without erasing the federal balance. Reforms should be judged by whether they increase legitimacy, reduce perverse incentives, and protect both majority voice and regional inclusion regardless of party advantage.",
