A practical middle path is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by requiring states to allocate electors proportionally (or by ranked-choice within the state), paired with uniform national rules for ballot access, counting, audits, and timely recounts. That approach keeps the constitutional framework, makes more voters relevant in every state, and lowers the odds of outcomes that feel arbitrary or illegitimate.",

A practical bridge is to compare a small set of reforms\u2014such as proportional (or otherwise less winner-take-all) allocation of electors, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, and expanding the House to rebalance representation\u2014against shared criteria like voter equality, state roles, stability, and constitutional durability. Whatever path is chosen, pairing it with clearer national standards for vote-counting, recounts, and certification can reduce distrust and make outcomes easier to accept across states.",

A practical compromise is to keep the state-run framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions through proportional (or ranked-choice-based) allocation of electors, alongside clear nationwide standards for voting access, recounts, and certification. We can compare options like this, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, or expanding the House using shared tests: making more voters matter in every state, preventing regional domination, and producing results that are transparent and broadly legitimate.",
