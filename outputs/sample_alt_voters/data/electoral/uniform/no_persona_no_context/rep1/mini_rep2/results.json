A practical middle path is to keep states administering elections but change incentives: require states to allocate electors proportionally (or by ranked-choice totals) and adopt uniform national standards for recounts, certification timelines, and ballot access. These steps would preserve a state-based framework while making more votes matter in every state and producing clearer, more widely accepted results.",
