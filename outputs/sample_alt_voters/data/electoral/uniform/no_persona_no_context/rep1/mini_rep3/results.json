A practical middle path is to keep the state-based framework while reducing winner-take-all distortions through proportional (or district-based with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards) allocation of electors and, where feasible, ranked-choice voting to ensure broader majority support. Alongside that, we can adopt uniform national standards for ballot counting, recount triggers, and post-election audits so close elections are more consistent and trusted. We can pilot and phase in changes, keeping what improves representation and confidence regardless of partisan advantage.",
