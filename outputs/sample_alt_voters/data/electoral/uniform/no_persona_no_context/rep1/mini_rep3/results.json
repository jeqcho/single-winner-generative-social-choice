A practical compromise is to keep a state-based role but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional (or ranked-choice) allocation of electors, alongside uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers. In parallel, we can evaluate broader options like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or a constitutional amendment against shared benchmarks: fewer \u201cwasted\u201d votes, incentives for truly national campaigns, and results that winners and losers can trust.",
