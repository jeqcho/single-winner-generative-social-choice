    "While some Americans want to keep the Electoral College to preserve federalism and encourage broad geographic coalitions, others favor a more direct reflection of the national popular vote. A workable middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce distortions by adopting uniform statewide rules\u2014such as proportional or district-based allocation with stronger election administration standards\u2014and supporting a compact or federal baseline that ensures the winner has a clear national mandate. This approach respects state roles while making outcomes more representative, transparent, and trusted."
