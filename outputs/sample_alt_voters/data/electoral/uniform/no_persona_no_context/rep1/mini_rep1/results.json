States could move away from winner-take-all by adopting proportional or ranked-choice allocation of electors, paired with stronger, uniform standards for ballots, audits, and recounts so close elections are resolved consistently. Over time, measures like expanding the House can further reduce disparities without requiring an immediate, high-risk constitutional overhaul.",

A practical compromise is to keep a state-based framework but reduce winner-take-all mismatches by encouraging proportional (or ranked-choice) allocation of electors, alongside clearer nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, recounts, and audits. We can compare options\u2014including House expansion or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014against shared criteria like legitimacy, regional balance, recount reliability, and constitutional durability, and prioritize reforms that improve incentives to campaign beyond a few swing states.",
