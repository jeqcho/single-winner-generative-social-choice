We can judge reforms by clear metrics\u2014how much they reduce \u201cdead\u201d votes, how resilient they are in close elections, and whether they still reward candidates who build geographically broad coalitions.",

A practical path is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by expanding proportional or district-based elector allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards, while also considering the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact with clear, uniform recount and certification standards. We should compare these options against shared criteria\u2014fairness to voters across states, incentives for broad cross-regional coalitions, and clear administration in close elections\u2014rather than treating the debate as all-or-nothing.",

A practical compromise is a stepwise reform package: encourage states to move from winner-take-all to proportional (or district-based with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) elector allocation, paired with clearer national standards for voting access, certification, and recounts to strengthen confidence in close elections. At the same time, we can evaluate larger changes like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or a constitutional amendment against the same agreed criteria\u2014fairness to voters, protection against one-region dominance, and stable, decisive outcomes.",
