A practical compromise is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by moving toward proportional (or otherwise more representative) elector allocation and by expanding the House to lessen vote-weight disparities, while keeping states central to administering elections. In parallel, we can evaluate the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact and adopt clearer, uniform standards for counting, certification, and recount triggers, comparing options against shared benchmarks of legitimacy, competitiveness, and stability.",

A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or ranked-choice allocation of electors, while also strengthening nationwide standards for ballot access, counting, and timely recounts. In parallel, expanding the House to better match population can narrow representation gaps and make outcomes feel fairer without forcing an immediate constitutional overhaul.",
