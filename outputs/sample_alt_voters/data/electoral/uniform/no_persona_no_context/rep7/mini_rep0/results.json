A practical reform path is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or ranked-choice-based elector allocation within states, while also improving transparency with uniform certification timelines and automatic recount triggers in close contests. In parallel, we can evaluate larger structural options\u2014like expanding the House to better balance representation or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014against shared benchmarks of fairness, stability, and broad geographic legitimacy.",
