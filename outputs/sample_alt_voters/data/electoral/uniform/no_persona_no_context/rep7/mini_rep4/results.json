If, after testing these changes, legitimacy concerns persist, then a structured pathway like the National Popular Vote compact could be evaluated with clear safeguards for close elections.",

A practical compromise is to reduce winner-take-all distortions while keeping a clear state role, by moving more states toward proportional (or district-based) elector allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards and more uniform rules for certification and recounts. We can also evaluate a National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or House expansion as additional steps, using transparent criteria like legitimacy, competitiveness beyond swing states, and confidence in close results.",
