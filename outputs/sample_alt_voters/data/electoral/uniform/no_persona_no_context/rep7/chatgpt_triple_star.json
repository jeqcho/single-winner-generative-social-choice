    "A practical path forward is to keep the Electoral College\u2019s federalist structure while reforming it to better reflect the national popular will and strengthen confidence in outcomes. Measures such as nationwide standards for voter access and election administration, awarding electors proportionally or by congressional district, and committing states to the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it reaches the threshold can reduce mismatches and discourage extreme battleground-state incentives. This approach respects small-state concerns about regional balance while addressing broad public expectations that the candidate with the most votes should usually win."
