A practical compromise is to reduce winner-take-all distortions while keeping the Electoral College framework, for example by expanding the House to lessen vote-weight gaps and encouraging proportional or ranked-choice allocation of electors within states. In parallel, we can set clearer, consistent national standards for recounts and election administration so close outcomes are handled transparently and predictably, whichever reform path is chosen.",
