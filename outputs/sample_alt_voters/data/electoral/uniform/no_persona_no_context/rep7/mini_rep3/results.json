If those steps still leave repeated popular-vote mismatches, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or a constitutional update can be evaluated as a next step with explicit safeguards for close elections.",

Instead of an all-or-nothing fight, we can prioritize reforms that reduce winner-take-all distortions and \u201csafe-state\u201d neglect\u2014such as proportional or district-based elector allocation with anti-gerrymandering safeguards, expanding the House to better align representation, and clearer national standards for recounts and audits.

A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional allocation of electors (or ranked-choice voting within states) and by adopting clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, and recounts. These changes aim to make more votes matter in more places while improving transparency, stability, and confidence in close elections.",
