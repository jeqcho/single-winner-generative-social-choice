A workable compromise is to keep the Electoral College but reduce winner-take-all distortions\u2014through proportional elector allocation (or district allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering rules), expanding the House to better match population, and binding electors with clear penalties for faithless votes. Alongside that, uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and automatic recount thresholds would build trust and make results more reliable no matter which state is close.",
