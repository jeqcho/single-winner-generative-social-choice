We can also evaluate a phased-in National Popular Vote approach with explicit thresholds and recount rules as a backstop, so the system better matches voter preferences without risking chaotic transitions.",

To reduce distortion without rewriting the Constitution overnight, states could also consider a phased-in popular-vote compact or other trigger-based reforms that take effect only when enough states participate and uniform rules are in place.",
