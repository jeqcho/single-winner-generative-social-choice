That approach preserves incentives for cross-state coalitions while making outcomes track voter preferences more closely and reducing close-election disputes.",

A workable middle path is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally or by district with strong anti-gerrymandering rules, paired with clear national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts. These changes would make more ballots matter in every state, reduce incentives to ignore rural or urban areas, and improve legitimacy in close elections without requiring an abrupt constitutional overhaul.",
