A workable compromise is to keep the state-based structure while reducing winner-take-all distortions through proportional (or carefully safeguarded district-based) elector allocation, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount thresholds. We can then compare options like expanding the House, ranked-choice voting for state presidential ballots, or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact against shared benchmarks of fairness, stability, and clear outcomes.",

A practical compromise is to keep state-run elections while reducing winner-take-all distortions\u2014through proportional elector allocation or an interstate compact that reflects the national popular vote\u2014and pairing that with national minimum standards for ballot access, audits, and recount triggers. If we judge reforms by fairness, stability, and public confidence rather than party advantage, we can modernize the system without erasing federalism.",
