A practical middle path is to keep the Electoral College framework but adopt reforms that make outcomes more representative and more predictable: require states to allocate electors proportionally (with anti-gerrymandering safeguards if districts are used), expand the House to reduce disparities, and set uniform national rules for recounts, audits, and elector certification. Those changes preserve federalism while reducing winner-take-all distortions and strengthening confidence that the winner reflects broad public support.",

A practical path is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions through proportional (or district-based with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) elector allocation, paired with stronger national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recount thresholds. For those who want a closer link to the national vote without an immediate amendment, states could also consider the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact with transparent contingency rules.
