A realistic compromise is to keep states administering elections but reduce winner-take-all effects and close-election chaos through a uniform method for allocating electors (such as a proportional or RCV-based approach), plus consistent national standards for ballots, audits, and recount triggers. If those steps narrow the popular-vote/outcome gap and broaden campaign incentives beyond a few battlegrounds, they can build confidence while leaving room for larger changes later.",

A practical bridge is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by moving toward proportional (or district-based) allocation with anti-gerrymandering safeguards, paired with clear nationwide baselines for voting access, ballot security, and recounts so close elections are resolved consistently.
