A workable middle path is to keep the state-based framework but require more representative elector allocation (e.g., proportional or ranked-choice-based within states) alongside uniform baseline standards for ballot access, counting, and recount triggers. That would preserve federalism and regional coalition-building while making outcomes track voter preferences more closely and reducing the chance of disputed, razor-thin endings.",
