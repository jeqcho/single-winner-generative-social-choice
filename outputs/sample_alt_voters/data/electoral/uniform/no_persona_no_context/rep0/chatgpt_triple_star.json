    "A balanced reform should preserve the Electoral College\u2019s role in encouraging broad, cross-regional coalitions while ensuring every voter\u2019s ballot is counted and perceived as meaningful. One practical path is to adopt nationwide standards for fair elections and allocate each state\u2019s electoral votes proportionally (or by congressional district with anti-gerrymandering safeguards), paired with a uniform automatic recount threshold for close outcomes. This approach acknowledges concerns about large-state dominance and federalism while reducing winner-take-all distortions and increasing legitimacy across the political spectrum."
