If those steps still leave large mismatches between the national vote and the winner, the country could then evaluate a defined next-step option\u2014such as the National Popular Vote compact or an amendment\u2014using agreed criteria like legitimacy, regional incentives, and stability.",

A practical way to bridge views is to compare incremental reforms\u2014such as proportional or district-based elector allocation, ranked-choice voting in state presidential ballots, and the National Popular Vote compact\u2014using shared criteria like fairness, stability, and whether candidates must compete in more places.

A practical path is to keep states\u2019 role in administering elections while reducing winner-take-all distortions and swing-state dominance\u2014through proportional or district-based elector allocation paired with ranked-choice voting for statewide ballots.
