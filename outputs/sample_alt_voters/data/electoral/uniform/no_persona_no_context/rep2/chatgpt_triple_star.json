    "While some view the Electoral College as an important safeguard for federalism and smaller states, others see it as undermining the principle of one person, one vote. A constructive middle ground is to preserve the state-based role in elections but reduce disparities by adopting reforms such as proportional allocation of electors or ranked-choice voting within states, along with stronger national standards for access and election administration. These changes would better align outcomes with the popular will while maintaining the Constitution\u2019s emphasis on states as key participants in choosing the president."
