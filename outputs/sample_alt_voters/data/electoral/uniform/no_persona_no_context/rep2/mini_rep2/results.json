A practical compromise is to keep elections administered by states but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation and adopting uniform standards for recounts and certification. If those steps still leave a persistent gap between the national vote and the outcome, a clearly triggered national popular-vote mechanism (such as an interstate compact) could serve as a backstop rather than an immediate overhaul.",
