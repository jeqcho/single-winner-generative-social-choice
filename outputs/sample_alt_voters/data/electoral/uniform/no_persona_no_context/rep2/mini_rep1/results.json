A bridging approach is to keep a state role in administering elections while reducing winner-take-all distortions through options like a uniform proportional or ranked-choice-based allocation of electors, combined with nationwide baseline standards for recounts, audits, and certification timelines. Reforms can be judged by whether they broaden campaign incentives beyond a few battleground states, reduce the chance that the popular-vote leader loses, and are implementable without partisan advantage.",

A practical bridge is to test reforms that preserve a meaningful state role while reducing winner-take-all distortions, such as proportional or district-based elector allocation paired with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards, plus clearer national recount and audit standards for close races. Options like ranked-choice voting within states or the National Popular Vote compact can then be evaluated against shared criteria\u2014fairness, transparency, competitiveness, and broad public confidence\u2014before any larger constitutional change.",

A practical bridge is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or ranked-choice allocation of electors at the state level and by setting clear, consistent recount and auditing standards nationwide. At the same time, reforms should preserve a meaningful state role and be phased in with transparent thresholds (such as a popular-vote compact trigger) so voters across regions and communities can trust the result and feel their ballots matter.",
