A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions by moving toward proportional (or otherwise vote-share-reflective) elector allocation, with safeguards against gerrymandering if districts are used. Alongside that, set clear national standards for certification, recounts, and election administration so close outcomes are resolved consistently and credibly. These steps can strengthen legitimacy and encourage campaigns beyond a handful of swing states without requiring immediate agreement on full abolition.",

A practical compromise is to keep the Electoral College but reduce the biggest distortions by ending winner-take-all where states choose, adopting proportional or ranked-choice allocation, and pairing that with uniform national standards for recounts, certification, and ballot access. Those steps would make campaigning matter in more places, reduce \u201cswing-state only\u201d incentives, and help ensure Americans can trust the outcome even when their side loses.",
