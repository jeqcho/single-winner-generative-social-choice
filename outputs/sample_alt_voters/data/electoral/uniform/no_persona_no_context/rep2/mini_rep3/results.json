We can evaluate any further steps\u2014such as an interstate popular-vote compact\u2014by the same test: does it increase legitimacy, broaden campaigning beyond a few swing states, and produce results most Americans can accept even when their side loses?",

A workable compromise is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or ranked-choice allocation of electors within states, while also adopting clear national standards for certification, recounts, and elector binding. Those steps keep states meaningfully involved but make outcomes track voter preferences more closely and reduce the sense that only a few swing states decide the country.",
