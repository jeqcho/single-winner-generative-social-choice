If those changes still leave persistent legitimacy concerns, a time-limited pilot like a safeguarded National Popular Vote compact could be evaluated against clear criteria: fewer ignored voters, stable transitions, and results the public accepts.",

A practical compromise is to keep the state-based structure while reducing winner-take-all distortions through proportional (or ranked-choice-based) elector allocation, paired with clearer national standards for voting access, counting, audits, and recounts. At the same time, we can evaluate bigger structural options\u2014like expanding the House or a popular-vote compact\u2014against shared criteria such as fairness, competitiveness in more states, and the ability to resolve close elections without chaos.",
