    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College and others want a national popular vote, a practical middle ground is to preserve the states\u2019 role in presidential elections while ensuring the winner reflects broad public support and maintains legitimacy. Reforms could include requiring electors to follow their state\u2019s vote, expanding the House to better align electoral votes with population, and moving more states toward proportional or district-based allocation to reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions. These steps keep the federal structure many value while addressing concerns about fairness, close-election stability, and voters in noncompetitive states feeling ignored."
