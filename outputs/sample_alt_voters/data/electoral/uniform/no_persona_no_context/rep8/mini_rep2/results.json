A practical reform package could keep the Electoral College but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based elector allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards, paired with uniform national standards for voter access, auditing, recounts, and certification. Alongside this, Congress could expand the House to better align electoral votes with population and reduce mismatches without erasing small-state influence.
