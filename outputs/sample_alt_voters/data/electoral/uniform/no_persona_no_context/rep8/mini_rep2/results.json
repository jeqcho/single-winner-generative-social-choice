A practical reform package could keep the Electoral College but require proportional (or fair district-based) allocation of electors, expand House representation to better match population, and set uniform national standards for ballot access, audits, recount triggers, and timely certification. These changes would make more votes matter in every state, lower the risk of popular-vote/electoral-vote mismatches, and strengthen trust that winners and losers can accept the result.",
