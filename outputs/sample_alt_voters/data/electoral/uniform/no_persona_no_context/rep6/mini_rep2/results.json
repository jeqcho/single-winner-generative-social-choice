If those steps still leave persistent popular-vote/EC mismatches, a broader, geographically supported national popular-vote mechanism\u2014through a compact or amendment\u2014can be debated with agreed-upon thresholds and safeguards.",

In parallel, we can continue evaluating the National Popular Vote compact or an amendment against shared goals: every vote mattering more, candidates building geographically broad support, and stable rules everyone sees as fair regardless of who wins.",

A practical compromise is to keep states administering elections but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional elector allocation (with anti-gerrymandering safeguards if districts are used), paired with clear national standards for recounts, audits, and ballot access.
