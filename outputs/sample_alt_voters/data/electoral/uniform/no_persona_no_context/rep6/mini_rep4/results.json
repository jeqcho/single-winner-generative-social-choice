Regardless of the larger choice, adopting transparent national standards for counting, recounts, and certification can reduce close-election disputes while preserving a meaningful role for states.",

A practical compromise is to keep state administration but reduce winner-take-all distortions through proportional (or district-based) elector allocation, paired with clearer national standards for ballot counting, certification, and recount triggers.
