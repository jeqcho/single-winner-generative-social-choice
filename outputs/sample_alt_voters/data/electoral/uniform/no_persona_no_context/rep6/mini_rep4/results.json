With shared criteria\u2014legitimacy, geographic coalition-building, and administrability\u2014we can compare bigger options like the National Popular Vote compact or a constitutional amendment without assuming either side is acting in bad faith.",

Larger changes like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be evaluated against the same shared criteria\u2014representativeness, incentives to campaign nationwide, and workable recount rules\u2014so the debate stays focused on legitimacy rather than party advantage.",

A practical compromise is to keep the state-based framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions by moving states toward proportional (or ranked-choice-informed) allocation of electors, while also adopting clear national minimum standards for counting, audits, and recount triggers. Alongside that, expanding the House could reduce the current elector imbalance between large and small states. Framing reforms around legitimacy, transparency, and nationwide engagement\u2014rather than party advantage\u2014can create a path that both federalism-minded voters and popular-vote-minded voters can accept.",
