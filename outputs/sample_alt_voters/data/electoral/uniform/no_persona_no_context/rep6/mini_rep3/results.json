We should compare these options using shared criteria\u2014legitimacy, simplicity, recount feasibility, and incentives for broad geographic outreach\u2014rather than partisan advantage.",

A practical middle-ground is to keep states administering elections but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with clearer national standards for voting access, counting, certification, and automatic recount triggers. We can also evaluate options like expanding the House (to reduce disparities in electoral-vote weight) or a carefully designed national popular vote compact with strong audit and recount safeguards. The shared test should be whether any reform improves legitimacy and nationwide campaigning without leaving smaller states or rural communities feeling ignored.",
