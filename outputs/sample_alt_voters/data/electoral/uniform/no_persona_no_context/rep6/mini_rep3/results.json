That approach narrows the gap between the popular vote and the outcome while encouraging candidates to compete in more places, not just a handful of battlegrounds.",

A practical consensus path is to pair clear, nationwide standards for counting, certification, and recounts with reforms that better match outcomes to voter preferences\u2014such as proportional allocation of electors, expanding the House to reduce distortions, and evaluating the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact with strong safeguards. We can compare these options by shared criteria like fairness, recount feasibility, incentives for nationwide campaigning, and public trust rather than partisan advantage.",

A practical compromise is to keep states administering elections but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional allocation of electors (with ranked-choice voting in each state to ensure majority support) and adopting clear, uniform national standards for ballots, recount triggers, and certification timelines. Alongside that, reforms like expanding the House to rebalance electoral votes and evaluating the National Popular Vote compact with strong recount safeguards can be compared on shared criteria: fairness, regional inclusion, and confidence in close outcomes.",
