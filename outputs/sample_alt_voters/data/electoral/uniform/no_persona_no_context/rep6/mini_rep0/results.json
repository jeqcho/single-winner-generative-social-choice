A practical bridge is to evaluate reforms side-by-side that preserve meaningful state roles while reducing popular-vote mismatches\u2014such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, proportional (or district-based) elector allocation with anti-gerrymandering safeguards, and a larger House to reduce elector imbalance. Whatever path we choose should also include clear, uniform standards for voting access, counting, audits, and recounts so close elections don\u2019t become confidence crises.",

A practical bridge is to reduce winner-take-all distortions while keeping states central by encouraging proportional allocation of electors (or a district method paired with strong anti-gerrymandering standards), and by updating the House apportionment rules to lessen elector imbalance. Alongside any allocation change, we can agree on national baseline standards for access, counting, audits, and recounts so close elections are handled consistently and trust is higher regardless of who wins.",
