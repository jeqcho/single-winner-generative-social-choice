    "While some want to keep the Electoral College to preserve federalism and the influence of smaller states and others prefer a direct national popular vote, most people agree the system should reflect voters\u2019 choices fairly and strengthen trust in elections. A practical middle-ground is to retain the Electoral College\u2019s state-based framework while adopting reforms that reduce distortions\u2014such as awarding electors proportionally or by district with clear, uniform rules, and adding a national baseline (e.g., a popular-vote threshold or interstate compact) to ensure the winner reflects broad support. These changes could protect state interests while making outcomes more representative and credible."
