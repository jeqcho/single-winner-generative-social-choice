A practical compromise is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by moving states toward proportional (or district-based) elector allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering and recount standards, while also evaluating the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact with clear safeguards for close margins. Pairing any change with improved election administration\u2014audits, clear rules, and a phased transition\u2014can build trust and let reforms be judged by measurable outcomes rather than partisan advantage.",

A practical compromise is to reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors (paired with anti-gerrymandering protections) and to adopt uniform, transparent recount and audit standards across states.
