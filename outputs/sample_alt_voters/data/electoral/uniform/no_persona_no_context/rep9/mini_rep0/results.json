A practical compromise is to keep the constitutional structure for now but reduce its biggest distortions by increasing the House (and thus lowering the built-in small-state skew), encouraging states to move away from winner-take-all allocations, and adopting consistent national rules for certification and recounts. If those steps still leave persistent legitimacy gaps, we can revisit a national popular-vote option with clear nationwide recount thresholds and safeguards for close elections.",
