A workable compromise is to pursue reforms that reduce winner-take-all distortions and swing-state tunnel vision\u2014such as proportional or ranked-choice allocation within states and a larger House\u2014while also strengthening uniform standards for counting, audits, and recount triggers. With clear metrics (closeness to the popular vote, geographic breadth of support, simplicity, and stability), we can compare options and adopt changes stepwise rather than forcing an all-or-nothing fight.",

A practical compromise is to keep the constitutional state-based framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional (or carefully designed district-based) elector allocation with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards, while also clarifying uniform rules for counting, recounts, and Congress\u2019s certification role. In parallel, states can openly evaluate the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact using agreed criteria like voter equality, regional legitimacy, and clear close-election procedures. Starting from shared standards of fairness and predictability lets us compare reforms on real tradeoffs instead of treating the debate as all-or-nothing.",
