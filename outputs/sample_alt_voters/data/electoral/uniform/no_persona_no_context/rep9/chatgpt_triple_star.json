    "A practical consensus is to preserve the Electoral College\u2019s role in reflecting state-based representation while ensuring the national outcome better matches voter intent and public confidence. Reforms could include uniform standards for ballot access and recounts, proportional allocation of electors within states or a national popular vote compact once enough states join, and safeguards against faithless or disputed electors. This approach respects federalism concerns while addressing worries about winner-take-all distortions, close-election legitimacy, and unequal influence across states."
