In parallel, adopt clear, uniform national standards for recounts, certification, and elector rules (including limits on faithless electors) to strengthen transparency and confidence regardless of which reform is chosen.",

A workable compromise is to keep the Constitution\u2019s state role but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional or ranked allocation of electors, paired with strong anti-gerrymandering protections if districts are used. At the same time, we can adopt uniform national standards for recounts, audits, and elector binding so close results are trusted regardless of which party wins. These reforms let states remain meaningful while making outcomes track voter preferences more closely and making every vote matter more.",
