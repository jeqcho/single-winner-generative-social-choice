With those trust-building steps in place, the country can evaluate bigger changes\u2014like a popular-vote compact or an amendment\u2014based on evidence about legitimacy, coalition-building, and governability rather than partisan advantage.",

A practical compromise is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions by moving toward proportional (or otherwise more representative) elector allocation, paired with an expanded House to better align elector counts with population. In parallel, adopting clear national standards for ballot access, counting, audits, and recounts would improve transparency and trust regardless of the long-term path. With shared criteria like fairness, simplicity, and federalism, we can compare options such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or other popular-vote ties based on evidence rather than partisan advantage.",
