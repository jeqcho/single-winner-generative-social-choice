    "A reasonable path forward is to preserve the Electoral College\u2019s role in reflecting state interests while ensuring the president is chosen with broad national legitimacy. Reforms such as expanding the use of proportional or district-based allocation of electors, establishing clear national standards for ballot access and recounts, and adopting a state-led national popular vote compact could better align outcomes with the popular vote without requiring a constitutional overhaul. This approach acknowledges concerns about both large-state dominance and democratic fairness by improving representativeness, transparency, and confidence in the results."
