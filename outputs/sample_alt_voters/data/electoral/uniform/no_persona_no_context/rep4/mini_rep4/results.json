If those changes improve representation and trust, the public will be better positioned to assess bigger steps\u2014like the National Popular Vote compact or a constitutional amendment\u2014without feeling the rules were rewritten for short-term advantage.",

In parallel, we can evaluate larger options\u2014such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or expanding the House (and thus electors)\u2014using shared metrics like legitimacy, clarity, and whether outcomes track the electorate without undermining federalism.",
