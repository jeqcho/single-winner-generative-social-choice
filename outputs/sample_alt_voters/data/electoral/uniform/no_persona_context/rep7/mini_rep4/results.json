That can be done by replacing winner-take-all with a uniform proportional allocation of electors (with a minimum statewide threshold to avoid fragmentation), while setting national baseline standards for ballot access, certification timelines, audits, and automatic recount triggers. Any shift toward a national popular vote should be phased in and paired with clear dispute-resolution rules so the system stays simple to explain, hard to manipulate, and legitimate to winners and losers alike.",

A practical bridge is to keep state-run administration but curb winner-take-all distortions through proportional elector allocation or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, with clear national baselines for ballot access, transparent audits, and automatic recount thresholds. Where feasible, adding ranked-choice voting can ensure majority support and reduce spoiler fears, making outcomes simpler to accept even for the losing side.",

A broadly acceptable path is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors nationwide (or using a carefully written popular-vote compact), paired with clear national baseline rules for ballot access, secure counting, audits, and automatic recount triggers. To reduce spoilers and improve legitimacy, states should be encouraged to use ranked-choice voting for president where practical, with changes phased in so the rules are easy to understand and trust.",
