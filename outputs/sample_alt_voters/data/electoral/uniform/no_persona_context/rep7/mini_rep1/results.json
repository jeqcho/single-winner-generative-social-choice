A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by moving to proportional elector allocation (or, if sufficient states agree, a National Popular Vote compact), alongside expanding the House to reduce representational distortion and binding electors to certified results. Pair these steps with clear national baselines for ballot access, audits, and automatic recount triggers so close elections are transparent, secure, and easier for all sides to accept.",

States should award electors proportionally (with clear, simple rules and protections against manipulation), while Congress sets baseline national standards for ballot access, voter verification, audits, and automatic recount triggers so close outcomes are transparent and trusted.
