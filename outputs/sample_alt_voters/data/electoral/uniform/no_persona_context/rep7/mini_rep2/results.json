Congress and states could adopt a uniform, nonpartisan election rulebook (ballot access, counting, audits, and recount triggers) and require states to allocate electors in a way that reflects their statewide vote share, with a small threshold to avoid extreme fragmentation. After several election cycles, the country could review whether this has improved legitimacy and competitiveness enough\u2014or whether to move further toward a national popular-vote solution.",

Pair either approach with simple, uniform national baselines for ballot access, transparent post\u2011election audits, and automatic recount triggers so close outcomes are easier to verify and accept.",
