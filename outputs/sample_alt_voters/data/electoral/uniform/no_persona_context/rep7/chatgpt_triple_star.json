    "While views differ on whether the Electoral College protects federalism and smaller states or undermines equal representation, most people agree the system should ensure both legitimacy and broad national support. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but modernize it by expanding the use of proportional or ranked allocation of electors within states, paired with national standards for ballot access, recounts, and election security. These reforms would better align outcomes with the popular vote while preserving states\u2019 roles and encouraging candidates to compete in more places."
