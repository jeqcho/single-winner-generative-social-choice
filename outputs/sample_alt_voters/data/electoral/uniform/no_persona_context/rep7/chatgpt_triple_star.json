    "Many Americans value the Electoral College for preserving federalism and encouraging broad coalitions, while others see it as outdated because it can diverge from the national popular vote and unevenly weight voters across states. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms that better align outcomes with voter preferences\u2014such as requiring states to use transparent, uniform rules for allocating electors (including multi-member district or proportional methods) and strengthening election administration standards nationwide. Paired with measures that reduce \"winner-take-all\" distortions and improve recount and auditing procedures, these steps could preserve state roles while increasing fairness, legitimacy, and public confidence.",
    "While some Americans favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and state-based representation, others prefer a more direct reflection of the national popular vote; a workable middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions. States could adopt proportional or district-based allocation of electors with strong, uniform standards for ballot access and election administration, and Congress could clarify procedures to strengthen transparency and prevent disputes. This approach maintains the role of states and the Electoral College while making outcomes more representative and credible to voters across the political spectrum.",
    "While some value the Electoral College for balancing state and regional interests and others prefer a direct national popular vote, most agree the system should make outcomes fairer and strengthen public trust. A practical middle ground is to keep states\u2019 roles but modernize the process through reforms such as uniform national standards for voter access and election administration, clearer rules for resolving disputes, and a commitment to allocate electors in ways that better reflect each state\u2019s vote totals. Any changes should be phased in with bipartisan oversight to protect federalism, prevent close-election chaos, and ensure the presidency reflects both broad national support and legitimate state-level participation.",
    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College should be preserved or replaced, many share the goal of elections that are both fair and trusted across all states. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms that better align outcomes with the national popular vote, such as expanding the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, encouraging proportional allocation of electors, and setting clear national standards for ballot access, voting security, and recounts. These changes can strengthen legitimacy and representation while respecting federalism and the role of states in administering elections.",
    "Many Americans value the Electoral College for preserving a federal balance among states, while others see it as undermining equal representation when the national popular vote and the outcome diverge. A workable middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms that better align results with voter preferences\u2014such as awarding electors proportionally or by district, strengthening nationwide standards for ballot access and election security, and establishing clear, uniform rules for recounts and certification. These changes would reduce winner-take-all distortions and improve legitimacy while respecting the role of states and avoiding abrupt constitutional upheaval."
