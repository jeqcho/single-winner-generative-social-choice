A practical compromise is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by adopting a uniform proportional method for assigning electors (with a small minimum threshold to avoid extreme fragmentation) while setting national baseline standards for registration access, ballot verification, audits, and automatic recount triggers. That would reduce swing-state dominance, make more voters matter in every state, and preserve a meaningful role for states in administering elections.",

A practical compromise is proportional allocation of electors (or a trigger-based National Popular Vote Interstate Compact) paired with uniform national baselines for ballot access, transparent audits/chain-of-custody, and clear recount thresholds and timelines. Where feasible, adding ranked-choice voting can help ensure the winner reflects broad majority support while keeping rules simple, auditable, and trusted in close contests.",
