If states choose to pursue a national popular-vote outcome through an interstate compact, it should include transparent thresholds, a transition period, and enforceable rules on elector binding so outcomes are predictable and legitimate.

Pair any structural change with national minimum standards for ballot access, secure paper trails, transparent recount triggers, and routine independent audits, and limit faithless electors to reduce uncertainty.

Whatever the allocation method, adopt nationwide minimum standards for ballot access, secure paper records, transparent audits, and uniform recount triggers, and limit faithless electors so results are reliable and widely accepted.
