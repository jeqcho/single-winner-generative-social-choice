First adopt clear nationwide minimum standards for ballot access, secure tabulation, transparent audits, and uniform recount/certification timelines, and require electors to follow the lawful certified result.

Pair any change with national minimum standards for voter access, secure and transparent counting, routine audits and recount rules, and binding electors to certified results to reduce fraud concerns, litigation, and faithless-elector disputes. Phasing reforms in with bipartisan oversight and fair districting protections can preserve smaller-state and rural influence while improving legitimacy and ensuring candidates must compete for support across the whole country.",
