Pair that with stronger, enforceable rules against faithless electors and basic anti-gerrymandering protections if any district-based allocation is used, so the system is easier to explain, harder to game, and more legitimate across regions.",

If a full popular-vote guarantee can\u2019t win agreement, states should at least end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally and binding electors to the certified results to reduce swing-state distortions and legitimacy crises.",
