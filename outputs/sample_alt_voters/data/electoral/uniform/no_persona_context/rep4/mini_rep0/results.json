In parallel, Congress and states should adopt baseline national rules for voter access, ballot processing, audits, and recount triggers to reduce disputes and increase confidence. After several cycles of demonstrated stability, the country could reevaluate whether an interstate compact or constitutional amendment toward a popular-vote outcome is warranted, ideally paired with a runoff or ranked-choice mechanism to ensure majority legitimacy.",
