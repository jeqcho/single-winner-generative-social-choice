    "While Americans differ on whether the Electoral College protects federalism and small-state influence or undermines equal representation, most agree presidential elections should be perceived as fair, accurate, and legitimate. A practical middle ground is to keep the Constitution\u2019s state-based role but adopt reforms that make outcomes more closely track voters\u2014such as awarding electors proportionally or by congressional district with uniform national standards, strengthening election security and recount rules, and encouraging interstate compacts only with broad bipartisan support. These steps would preserve the state\u2013national balance while reducing the risk of winner-take-all distortions and increasing public confidence in close elections.",
    "A constructive path forward is to keep the Electoral College\u2019s role in balancing state and national interests while reforming it to better reflect the popular will and strengthen public confidence. Reforms such as requiring states to allocate electors proportionally or through a nationwide compact, setting uniform standards for counting and recounts, and clarifying congressional certification rules can reduce the risk of disputed outcomes without forcing an immediate constitutional overhaul. This approach acknowledges those who value federalism and stability as well as those who prioritize one-person-one-vote, aiming for a fairer, more transparent system regardless of party.",
    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and state influence and others prefer a direct national popular vote, many can agree the current system should better reflect voters\u2019 will while maintaining stability and broad geographic support. A pragmatic path is to adopt reforms\u2014such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or uniform proportional allocation of electors\u2014paired with stronger nationwide voting standards, transparent recount rules, and measures that reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions. This approach respects states\u2019 roles while increasing fairness, competitiveness, and confidence in close elections.",
    "While opinions differ on whether the Electoral College protects federalism or undermines equal representation, most people agree the presidency should reflect the public\u2019s will and remain broadly legitimate across states. A practical middle ground is to keep the state-based framework but modernize it by adopting reforms that better align electoral votes with voters\u2014such as proportional allocation or the National Popular Vote compact triggered only when enough states join\u2014while strengthening uniform voting access and transparency. These steps can reduce distortions and close-election disputes without requiring an abrupt, nationwide constitutional overhaul.",
    "A constructive path forward is to preserve the Electoral College\u2019s role in ensuring states have a meaningful voice while updating it to better reflect the national popular will and strengthen public confidence. Reforms such as expanding the House to reduce winner-take-all distortions, setting uniform standards for elector appointment and vote certification, and encouraging proportional or district-based allocation in more states can balance federalism with fairness. This approach acknowledges concerns about small-state influence and local representation while addressing widely shared goals of transparency, legitimacy, and every vote counting more equally."
