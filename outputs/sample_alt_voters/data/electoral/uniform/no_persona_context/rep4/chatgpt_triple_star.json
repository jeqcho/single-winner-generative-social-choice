    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and state-based representation and others prefer a direct national popular vote, many Americans agree the system should better reflect voter intent and maintain legitimacy. A practical middle path is to keep the constitutional structure but adopt reforms\u2014such as expanding the use of proportional or district-based allocation of electors, establishing clear national standards for elections and recounts, and reducing winner-take-all distortions\u2014so outcomes align more closely with the national vote while protecting smaller states\u2019 voices. Any changes should be pursued through transparent, bipartisan processes that strengthen confidence in results and ensure every ballot is counted fairly."
