States could allocate electors proportionally (with electors legally bound to certified results) or adopt a national popular-vote compact as a voluntary path, and either approach should come with clear national minimum standards for registration, ballot handling, paper-backed risk-limiting audits, and automatic recount triggers. That combination makes close elections less likely to spiral into court fights, makes campaigns compete beyond a few swing areas, and improves trust without requiring Washington to run elections day-to-day.",
