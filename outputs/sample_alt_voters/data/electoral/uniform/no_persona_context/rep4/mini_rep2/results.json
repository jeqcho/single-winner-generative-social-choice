A practical package is to replace statewide winner-take-all with a fairer allocation formula (such as proportional with a minimum threshold) and expand the House to reduce extreme vote-weight disparities, while requiring paper-backed ballots, routine risk-limiting audits, and uniform recount and certification deadlines. If these changes still leave repeated \u201cwrong-winner\u201d results, Congress and the states could add a clearly defined national popular-vote fail-safe that activates only when the national margin is decisive and verifiable.",

A workable compromise is to keep state-run elections and the Electoral College structure but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional elector allocation, binding electors to certified results, and setting clear nationwide baselines for paper records, audits, and recount triggers. To reduce remaining \u201cwrong-winner\u201d risk, the country could add a narrowly defined national popular-vote backstop or adopt the National Popular Vote compact once uniform verification rules are in place.",

A practical middle path is to end winner-take-all by moving to proportional (or ranked-choice) allocation of electors, bind electors to certified results, and adopt clear national minimum standards for ballot access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recount triggers. If large \u201cwrong-winner\u201d outcomes persist, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can serve as a phased backstop\u2014paired with uniform verification rules\u2014so every voter matters without inviting chaos or partisan gamesmanship.",
