Then, states could choose a more representative way to award electors\u2014such as proportional allocation using a common formula\u2014so vote shares translate more fairly without requiring an immediate constitutional overhaul.",

Require states to move away from winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with strong anti-gerrymandering guardrails) and bind electors to the certified result. Pair this with clear nationwide baseline standards for ballot access, transparent counting and certification, routine audits, and automatic recount thresholds so close elections are verifiable and trusted. If the country later wants to go further, a carefully phased national popular-vote option\u2014potentially with ranked-choice to ensure majority legitimacy\u2014could be considered once those shared safeguards are in place.",

A strong middle path is to keep state-run elections but replace winner-take-all with proportional (or ranked-choice-based) allocation of electors, require electors to follow the certified result, and adopt clear national minimum standards for ballot access, security, audits, certification, and automatic recount triggers. After those rules are proven to work across several cycles, states could choose a transparent national popular-vote backstop (such as the NPV compact) to further align outcomes with nationwide support without a sudden, high-risk constitutional shock.",
