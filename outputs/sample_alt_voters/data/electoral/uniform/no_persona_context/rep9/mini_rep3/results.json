Any change should be paired with nationwide minimum rules for ballot access, auditable paper records, transparent postelection audits, and clear recount triggers so results are comparable and trusted across states. This approach keeps regional representation while making campaigns compete for votes everywhere, not just in a handful of battlegrounds.",

To improve legitimacy and acceptance, pair any allocation changes with uniform minimum standards for ballot access, secure auditable paper records, transparent post-election audits, and clear recount triggers and timelines.
