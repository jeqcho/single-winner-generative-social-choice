States could allocate electors by a consistent proportional formula, with a modest statewide bonus for the top finisher to preserve incentives for broad coalitions, and require electors to follow the certified result. Pair that with national baseline rules for voter access, paper-backed audits, and automatic recounts in close margins so outcomes are simpler to verify and harder to dispute. If confidence grows, the same standards can support a later transition to a national popular-vote option without a sudden, high-risk overhaul.",

Pair this with clear national baselines for ballot access, paper trails, transparent audits, certification, and automatic recount triggers so close elections are handled consistently and credibly. If the public wants to go further after these rules are proven, states could opt into a National Popular Vote compact or a direct popular vote\u2014ideally with ranked-choice\u2014to ensure broad majority support without abrupt disruption.",
