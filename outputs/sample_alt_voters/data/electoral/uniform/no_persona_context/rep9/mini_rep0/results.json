Congress and the states could adopt national baseline rules for voter access, paper ballots, audits, and clear recount triggers, then shift elector allocation away from winner-take-all\u2014either proportional statewide or by district with strong anti-gerrymandering protections and an expanded House to reduce small-state skew. After those guardrails are in place and trusted, the country could consider a popular-vote \u201ctie-breaker\u201d or compact that activates only when the national vote and electoral outcome diverge, so reform is incremental rather than abrupt.",

If those safeguards build broad trust, the country could then consider a phased national popular-vote backstop\u2014potentially with ranked-choice\u2014to align the winner with majority support without a sudden overhaul.",

Pair that with clear national minimum standards for ballot access, voter ID/verification options, auditable paper records, post-election audits, and automatic recount triggers so close results are handled consistently. If these steps build trust, the country could later adopt a national popular-vote backstop\u2014such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u2014only with proven safeguards and broad bipartisan support.",
