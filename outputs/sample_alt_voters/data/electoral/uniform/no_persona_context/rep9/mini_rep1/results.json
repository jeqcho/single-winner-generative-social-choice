Set clear national minimums for voter access, paper-backed verification, postelection audits, and transparent dispute resolution so close elections are credibly settled.

Pair any structural change with clear national baselines for ballot access, auditable paper trails, transparent postelection audits, and uniform recount triggers to improve legitimacy and reduce disputes. Implement reforms gradually, with bipartisan oversight and public education, so campaigns compete beyond a handful of battleground states while smaller and rural communities retain a meaningful voice.",

States could adopt proportional or fair district-based elector allocation with strong anti\u2011gerrymandering protections, while also allowing a phased interstate agreement to reflect the national popular vote once clear legal and administrative safeguards are met.
