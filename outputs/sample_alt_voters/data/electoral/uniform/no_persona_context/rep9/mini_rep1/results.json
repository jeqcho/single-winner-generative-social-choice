A practical compromise is to bind electors to results and allocate electoral votes proportionally (or by district with strong anti-gerrymandering safeguards), paired with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, paper trails, audits, certification timelines, and automatic recount triggers. Once those integrity rules are in place and tested, states could consider a carefully designed national popular-vote compact\u2014potentially with ranked-choice ballots\u2014to better align the outcome with overall voter preference.",
