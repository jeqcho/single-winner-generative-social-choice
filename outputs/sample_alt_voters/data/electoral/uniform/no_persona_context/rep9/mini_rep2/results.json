Pair that with uniform national baselines for ballot access, paper trails, audits, certification timelines, and automatic recount triggers so every vote is counted and verified consistently. If the system proves stable, a phased National Popular Vote compact\u2014ideally with ranked-choice voting to ensure majority-backed winners\u2014can be considered as a next step.",

A practical middle step is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electors (or district allocation only with strong anti-gerrymandering rules), while setting clear national baselines for ballot access, paper records, audits, certification timelines, and automatic recount triggers so close results are handled consistently. If the country wants to go further, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact can be a phased path once those safeguards are in place, and pairing it with ranked-choice voting can help ensure the winner has broad, majority-backed legitimacy.",
