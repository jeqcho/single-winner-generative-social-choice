    "Any reform to the Electoral College should preserve the goal of ensuring broad, geographically diverse support for presidential candidates while better aligning outcomes with voters\u2019 preferences and strengthening public confidence in the result. A practical middle ground is to keep a state-based system but adopt changes that reduce mismatches between the national vote and the winner\u2014such as expanding the use of proportional or district-based allocation, setting clearer national standards for recounts and election administration, and requiring more transparency and accountability from electors. These steps can respect federalism and smaller-state concerns while making the process feel fairer and more representative to voters nationwide."
