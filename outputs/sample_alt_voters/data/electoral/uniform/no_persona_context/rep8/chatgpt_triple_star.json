    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and ensure smaller states retain a meaningful voice, others seek reform to better align outcomes with the national popular will and strengthen public confidence. A consensus approach could keep the state-based structure but modernize it through measures like a uniform national standard for allocating electoral votes, requiring broader geographic support, and expanding voter access and election security. Reforms should be bipartisan, transparent, and phased in so voters and states can adapt, with the shared goal of making presidential elections both legitimate and broadly representative."
