As an additional pathway, states could adopt a national popular-vote compact once clear participation thresholds are met, so the winner reflects the widest nationwide support without an immediate constitutional rewrite. Whichever route is chosen, pair it with uniform national baselines for ballot access, paper-trail audits, automatic recount triggers, and binding electors to certified results so close elections are transparent, predictable, and widely accepted.",
