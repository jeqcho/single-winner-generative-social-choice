Pair any change with uniform national baselines for ballot access, paper-backed voting, automatic recount thresholds, and routine risk-limiting audits, plus enforceable rules against faithless electors.

Once those safeguards are in place and enough states opt in, consider a National Popular Vote compact or similar popular-vote backstop, and pilot ranked-choice voting to reward broad coalitions and avoid spoiler outcomes.",
