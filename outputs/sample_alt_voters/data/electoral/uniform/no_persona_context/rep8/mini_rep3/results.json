Pair this with uniform national baseline rules for paper trails, transparent certification, risk-limiting audits, and automatic recount triggers so close elections are settled by clear, trusted procedures rather than ad hoc fights. If these steps build confidence, states could then choose to align outcomes even more closely with the national popular vote through a voluntary compact, with ranked-choice voting as an option to ensure majority support.",

Pair this with nationwide minimum rules for ballot access, paper records, risk-limiting audits, and automatic recount triggers so close elections are decided by transparent procedures rather than partisan fights.
