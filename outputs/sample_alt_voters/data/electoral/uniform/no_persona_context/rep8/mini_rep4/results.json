As a longer\u2011term option, allow an interstate agreement to award electors to the national popular\u2011vote winner only after it reaches a clearly defined supermajority of states and electoral votes, to avoid a patchwork transition. Whichever path is chosen should be paired with paper-backed voting, routine risk\u2011limiting audits, clear recount triggers, and enforceable rules that electors must follow certified results so close outcomes are credible nationwide.",

Pair any structural change with uniform national baselines for voter access and secure, paper-backed tabulation, plus transparent post-election audits and clear recount triggers.
