    "Many people value the Electoral College for preserving a federal balance among states, while others see it as undermining the principle that each vote should carry equal weight. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms that make outcomes more closely reflect the national popular will\u2014such as uniform standards for ballot access and counting, reducing winner-take-all rules through proportional or district-based allocation, and strengthening protections against faithless electors. These steps would respect state roles while improving fairness, transparency, and public confidence in presidential elections."
