Pair that with national baseline standards for voter access, chain-of-custody, audits, recount triggers, and certification deadlines so close elections are handled consistently and transparently. After these reforms are in place, the country could revisit whether an interstate compact or constitutional amendment for a popular-vote outcome is still needed, ideally with a majority-guaranteeing mechanism like ranked-choice or a runoff.",
