A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional allocation of electoral votes in every state, bind electors to the certified results, and set baseline national standards for secure ballots, transparent audits, and clear recount triggers. To reduce representation distortions, expand the House so electoral votes track population more closely, and only after these steps prove workable, consider a national popular-vote backstop (such as an interstate compact) with a simple runoff option to ensure a clear winner.",
