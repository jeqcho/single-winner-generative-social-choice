Pair that with nationwide baseline standards for voter access, paper-backed tabulation, audits, recount triggers, and certification timelines so close elections are resolved consistently and transparently. Separately, Congress should consider increasing the House size to reduce representation distortions, with any move to a full national popular vote reserved for later and paired with a clear majority-winner method like a runoff or ranked-choice.",

To reduce structural distortions further without abrupt change, expand the House to better match population and lessen disparities in representation.

A practical bridge is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) allocation of electors, while adopting clear national baseline standards for ballots, audits, recount triggers, and binding electors to results. To reduce today\u2019s built-in distortions, Congress should also expand the House, and if these steps still fail to track the popular will, a transparent National Popular Vote compact or amendment with a runoff/ranked-choice tally can be considered as a later, clearly defined next step.",
