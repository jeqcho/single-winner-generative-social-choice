The lowest-risk step is to require every state to allocate electors by a uniform proportional formula and to bind electors to the certified result, alongside nationwide baseline rules for ballots, post\u2011election audits, and recount thresholds. If those changes build confidence, a later option is a majority-requirement (ranked-choice or runoff) or a popular-vote compact as a backstop to prevent repeated popular-vote/Electoral-College splits.",
