Pair this with clear national baseline standards for ballots, audits, and automatic recount triggers in close races, and leave room for a later shift to a popular\u2011vote outcome with a ranked\u2011choice/runoff mechanism if broader agreement develops.",

A practical first step is to end winner\u2011take\u2011all by allocating electors proportionally (or by district with strong anti\u2011gerrymandering rules), bind electors to certified results, and set clear national minimum standards for ballot access, paper trails, audits, and recounts.
