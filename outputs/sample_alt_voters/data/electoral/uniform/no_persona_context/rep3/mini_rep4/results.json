If states choose to coordinate toward a national popular-vote outcome (e.g., via an interstate compact), it should activate only after objective safeguards are met, including auditable paper records, consistent recount thresholds, and enforceable rules against faithless electors. Pairing these changes with anti-gerrymandering protections for any district-based approach and a gradual implementation timeline can improve fairness and legitimacy without abrupt constitutional disruption.",

Pair any change with nationwide minimum standards for ballot access and secure administration, including auditable paper records, routine post-election audits, and automatic recount triggers, plus stronger, enforceable limits on faithless electors.
