This would make more votes matter in every state, shrink the battleground-state problem, and improve confidence that the winner reflects broad, nationwide support.",

To strengthen majority legitimacy without a disruptive overhaul, states could phase in ranked-choice or a runoff mechanism and/or a National Popular Vote compact as a backstop if the electoral and national vote diverge.",

A strong middle path is to end winner-take-all by awarding electors proportionally in every state, bind electors to the certified results, and set clear nationwide minimum standards for ballot access, paper trails, audits, and automatic recounts in close races. If the electoral and national popular vote diverge, a limited popular-vote backstop (or phased-in National Popular Vote compact) can be used to reinforce legitimacy without a sudden overhaul.",
