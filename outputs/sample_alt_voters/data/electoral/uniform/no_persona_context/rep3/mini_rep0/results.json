If no candidate reaches a true majority of the national vote, a single, standardized runoff (or ranked-choice tabulation) could ensure the winner has broad support without forcing a full constitutional overhaul.",

A practical bridge is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or ranked-choice) allocation of electors in every state, with electors bound to certified results, and add clear national minimum standards for ballot access, paper-trail audits, and automatic recounts in close races. If that still produces a clear mismatch between the national vote and the outcome, a National Popular Vote-style compact or amendment can serve as a transparent backstop so campaigns compete everywhere and every community feels counted.",
