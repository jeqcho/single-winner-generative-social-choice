    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve the role of states and others want direct national election to ensure equal weight for every vote, a practical compromise is to make outcomes more representative without erasing federalism. States could adopt reforms such as proportional allocation of electors (or expanding district-based allocation), establish uniform minimum standards for ballot access and recounts, and increase transparency and security in vote counting. At the same time, Congress and the states could continue evaluating national options\u2014such as an interstate compact or constitutional amendment\u2014only if they can demonstrate broad, bipartisan support and clear benefits to legitimacy and stability."
