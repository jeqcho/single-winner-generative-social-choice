    "People disagree about whether the Electoral College protects federalism and encourages broad coalitions or whether it can distort the popular will, but most share a goal of elections that are fair, legitimate, and nationally credible. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional structure while adopting reforms that better align outcomes with voter preferences\u2014such as nationwide standards for ballot access and counting, expanding the use of proportional or district-based elector allocation, and supporting mechanisms like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once a broad bipartisan threshold is met. These steps would reduce the chance of a popular-vote/electoral-vote mismatch while preserving the states\u2019 role and incentivizing candidates to campaign beyond a few swing states.",
    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College should be kept, reformed, or replaced, many share the goal of making presidential elections both fair and broadly legitimate. A practical middle ground is to preserve the constitutional framework while adopting reforms that better align outcomes with the national popular vote\u2014such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors, stronger nationwide standards for voting access and election administration, and measures that reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions. These changes can respect federalism and regional representation while ensuring every vote carries more equal weight and the winner has clear democratic credibility.",
    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College should be preserved or replaced, many share goals of fairness, legitimacy, and ensuring every voter feels heard. A pragmatic consensus could be to keep the current framework in the near term but adopt reforms that reduce winner-take-all distortions, strengthen election security, and align outcomes more closely with the national popular vote\u2014such as incentivizing proportional allocation of electors or a carefully designed interstate compact. Any change should be phased in and tied to clear, broadly supported standards so it protects smaller states\u2019 interests while improving confidence in the result.",
    "While people differ on whether the Electoral College should be preserved, reformed, or replaced, many agree the system should better reflect the popular will while protecting the voice of smaller states. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but adopt reforms that reduce winner-take-all distortions, such as proportional or district-based allocation of electors, uniform national standards for ballot access and recounts, and stronger transparency and security measures. In parallel, states could consider compacts like the National Popular Vote as a voluntary pathway, with clear safeguards, so change can be tested and adjusted without abrupt disruption. This approach respects federalism and tradition while addressing fairness, legitimacy, and voter confidence.",
    "While some Americans want to keep the Electoral College to preserve federalism and state influence and others favor a national popular vote for equal weight of every ballot, most can agree the system should reflect voters\u2019 will and maintain broad geographic legitimacy. A practical middle ground is to keep the state-based framework but adopt reforms that reduce mismatch risk and increase competition\u2014such as uniform vote-counting standards, expanded ballot access, and awarding electors by district or proportionally with strong safeguards against partisan gerrymandering. These steps can make outcomes feel fairer and more representative while respecting the role states play in presidential elections."
