Pair this with clear national baseline standards for ballot access, tabulation, post-election audits, and automatic recount triggers so close outcomes are transparent and not litigated ad hoc.

Replace winner-take-all with a uniform proportional allocation of electors (with a small minimum threshold to avoid extreme fragmentation), require electors to follow certified results, and pair it with clear nationwide baselines for ballot access, tabulation transparency, audits, and automatic recount triggers. If confidence increases but mismatches persist, a later step\u2014an interstate compact or amendment for a national popular vote\u2014should include the same guardrails and could be paired with ranked-choice voting to ensure the winner has broad support.",
