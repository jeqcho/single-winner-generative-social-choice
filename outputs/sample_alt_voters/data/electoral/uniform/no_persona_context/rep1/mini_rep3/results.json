In parallel, increase the size of the House to better align electoral votes with population, and only consider a national popular-vote guarantee if it comes with agreed-upon rules for close elections and broad, cross-regional legitimacy.",

A broadly acceptable compromise is to allocate electors proportionally (or by district with anti-gerrymandering guardrails), bind electors to certified results, and adopt uniform national baselines for ballot access, paper-backed audits, certification timelines, and automatic recount triggers. With those safeguards in place, ranked-choice voting and/or a carefully designed national popular-vote compact or amendment can be considered later if there is broad, bipartisan confidence it will be stable and not invite nationwide recount chaos.",

Require every state to allocate electors proportionally (with a small, clear minimum-vote threshold) and bind electors to certified results, while setting national baseline rules for ballot access, paper-backed audits, certification timelines, and automatic recount triggers. To further reduce spoiler fears and encourage broader coalitions, states should be allowed\u2014and encouraged\u2014to use ranked-choice voting for president as long as results remain transparent and auditable. After these steps rebuild confidence, the country can revisit a popular-vote guarantee via compact or amendment only if it includes the same uniform safeguards to avoid coast-to-coast recount chaos.",
