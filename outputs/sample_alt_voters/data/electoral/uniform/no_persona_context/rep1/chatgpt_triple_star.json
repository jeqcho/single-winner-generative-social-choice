    "While people differ on whether the Electoral College should be preserved or replaced, many agree the system should better reflect voters\u2019 choices while keeping incentives for broad, national coalitions. A practical middle path is to retain the Constitution\u2019s framework but adopt reforms\u2014such as a national popular vote mechanism or state-by-state allocation changes, stronger uniform election standards, and clearer procedures for resolving disputes\u2014that reduce mismatches between the popular vote and the outcome. This approach respects federalism and smaller-state concerns while increasing legitimacy, transparency, and public confidence in presidential elections."
