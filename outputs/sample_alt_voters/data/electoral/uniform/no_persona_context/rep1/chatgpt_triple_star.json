    "While opinions differ on whether the Electoral College should be kept, reformed, or replaced, many Americans share goals of making presidential elections fair, transparent, and broadly legitimate. A practical middle ground is to preserve the federal role of states while adopting reforms that better align outcomes with the national popular will\u2014such as expanding the use of proportional statewide allocation of electors, strengthening election administration and recount standards, and considering an interstate compact only with clear safeguards. Any change should be pursued through bipartisan agreement and public input to protect smaller states\u2019 voices while ensuring every vote carries meaningful weight.",
    "While some Americans favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and state influence and others prefer a direct national popular vote, there is room for reforms that strengthen legitimacy without discarding the system outright. A practical middle ground is to standardize election administration and adopt reforms such as expanding the national popular vote \u201ccompact\u201d framework or proportional allocation of electors, while preserving each state\u2019s role in choosing electors. These steps could reduce \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions, encourage broader campaigning, and ensure the presidency reflects both nationwide support and the country\u2019s state-based structure.",
    "While people disagree on whether the Electoral College protects federalism or distorts majority rule, many can agree the system should reflect voters more accurately while preserving state-based representation. A practical middle path is to keep the Electoral College but adopt reforms\u2014such as expanding the House to better balance state influence, requiring uniform voting standards and audits, and encouraging states to allocate electors by a proportional or district-based method\u2014to reduce winner-take-all distortions. These steps would strengthen legitimacy, protect smaller-state interests, and move outcomes closer to the national popular will without requiring an immediate constitutional overhaul.",
    "Americans across the spectrum want presidential elections that are fair, competitive, and trusted, whether they prioritize the national popular will or the role of states in the federal system. A practical middle ground is to preserve the Electoral College\u2019s state-based framework while reforming it to better reflect voters and reduce perverse incentives\u2014such as adopting ranked-choice voting for presidential elections, allocating electors proportionally within states, and setting national standards for ballot access, recounts, and certification. These changes would make outcomes more representative and transparent without requiring an immediate constitutional overhaul, while leaving room for broader debate about a direct popular vote in the future.",
    "Many Americans value the Electoral College for preserving the role of states and encouraging broad coalitions, while others see it as undermining the principle that every vote should carry equal weight. A workable middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but modernize it by reducing winner-take-all rules, strengthening election administration and recount standards, and adopting reforms\u2014such as proportional allocation or a compact\u2014that better align outcomes with the national popular vote. Any change should be pursued transparently and with bipartisan agreement to protect legitimacy, federalism, and voters\u2019 confidence in close elections."
