Any path should be paired with clear national baselines for voter access, ballot design, counting timelines, automatic recount triggers, and post-election risk-limiting audits, while leaving day-to-day administration to states. Phased adoption, shared transparency standards, and penalties for faithless electors can reduce battleground-state distortion and make close elections easier to accept across regions.",

Any structural change should come with simple, nationwide baseline rules for voter eligibility verification, ballot access, counting, automatic recount thresholds, and routine post\u2011election audits to reduce litigation and build trust.
