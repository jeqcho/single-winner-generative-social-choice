States could award electors by a uniform proportional formula (with a small minimum statewide bonus to preserve a state voice), require electors to follow the certified vote, and adopt shared national baselines for voter access, audits, recount triggers, and certification deadlines. After those rules are proven to work for a few cycles, the country could revisit a national popular-vote option\u2014ideally with ranked-choice or a runoff\u2014to ensure majority legitimacy without endless recounts.",

Pair that with uniform national baselines for ballot access, secure audits, automatic recount triggers, and timely certification, and require electors to be bound to the state vote. If broader change is desired later, a national popular-vote outcome\u2014ideally with ranked-choice to ensure majority legitimacy\u2014can be phased in once the shared integrity standards are in place.",

A practical compromise is to keep state-run elections but end winner-take-all by moving to proportional (or district-based with anti-gerrymandering rules) elector allocation, while binding electors to the certified state vote. Pair that with nationwide baseline standards for ballot access, multilingual voter information, post-election audits, and automatic recount triggers, and allow states to pilot ranked-choice voting so winners show broad support and close outcomes are trusted.",
