Pair that with clear national baseline rules for ballot access, counting, audits, certification deadlines, and automatic recount triggers so close elections are transparent and harder to game. This approach makes it far less likely the popular-vote winner loses, broadens campaign incentives beyond a few swing states, and builds confidence that results will be accepted even in tight races.",
