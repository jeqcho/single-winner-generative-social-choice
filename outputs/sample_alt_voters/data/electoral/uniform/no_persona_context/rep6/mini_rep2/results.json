If these steps prove workable, states could then opt into a carefully drafted popular-vote agreement with transparent trigger conditions and safeguards for administration and close elections.",

Pair any structural change with nationwide minimum standards for ballot access, secure counting, routine post-election audits, and consistent recount/certification rules to reduce confusion and litigation.
