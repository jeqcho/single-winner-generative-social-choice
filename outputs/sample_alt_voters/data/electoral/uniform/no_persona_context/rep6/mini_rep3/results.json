In parallel, Congress and states should set clear national guardrails for registration access, ballot design, chain-of-custody, risk-limiting audits, and recount triggers so outcomes are credible and comparable across states. These changes can be phased in voluntarily by states and evaluated over multiple cycles, preserving federalism while making results track broad national support more reliably.",

Pair any allocation changes with clear national baselines for ballot access, counting/certification, routine public post\u2011election audits, and predictable recount triggers to strengthen legitimacy and reduce litigation.

Pair any change with simple, nationwide minimum standards for voter access, transparent counting and certification, routine post\u2011election audits, and clear recount triggers to limit litigation and build trust.
