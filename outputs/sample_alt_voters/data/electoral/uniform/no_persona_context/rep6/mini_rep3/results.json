If the country later wants \u201cmost votes wins,\u201d that shift can be conditioned on meeting those integrity benchmarks and paired with a majority-winner mechanism (such as a runoff) to preserve broad legitimacy.",

To build trust across communities, pair that with clear national baselines for ballot access, security audits, transparent certification deadlines, and automatic recount triggers; if confidence grows, a National Popular Vote-style compact or a majority winner method like ranked-choice could be considered as a later step.",
