To protect small-state and rural concerns, pair that with a majority-support requirement (such as ranked-choice or a runoff trigger) so the winner has broad backing rather than a narrow plurality. Whatever allocation method is used, national baseline rules for voter access, verification, certification timelines, and automatic recount thresholds should be standardized so close outcomes are consistent and widely trusted.",
