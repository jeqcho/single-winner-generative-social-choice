    "While some Americans favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve federalism and encourage broad coalitions, others argue it can undermine the principle that every vote should carry equal weight. A practical middle ground is to retain the state-based structure but reduce outcomes that conflict with the national popular vote by adopting reforms such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it clearly reflects durable, nationwide support, along with uniform election standards and ranked-choice voting to ensure majority-backed winners. These steps can protect state roles and political stability while improving fairness, legitimacy, and voter confidence regardless of where someone lives.",
    "The Electoral College should be reformed to better reflect the will of voters while preserving incentives for candidates to engage a broad national coalition, including smaller and rural states. A pragmatic path is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions through measures like proportional or district-based allocation of electors and stronger national standards for ballot access, recounts, and election security. Many could also support a safeguard\u2014such as an interstate compact or federal legislation\u2014that ensures the popular-vote winner prevails once a clear national threshold is met, paired with protections against close-election instability.",
    "While some Americans favor keeping the Electoral College to protect federalism and smaller states and others prefer a direct national popular vote, there is broad room for reform that strengthens legitimacy and voter confidence. A pragmatic middle ground is to preserve the state-based structure but reduce winner-take-all outcomes through proportional or district-based allocation of electors, paired with uniform national standards for ballot access, election security, and recounts. Reforms should aim to ensure the presidency reflects a clear national mandate while maintaining incentives for candidates to engage voters across a wide range of states.",
    "While some Americans prefer keeping the Electoral College to protect federalism and ensure smaller states retain influence, others favor moving closer to a national popular vote to strengthen democratic legitimacy. A pragmatic middle ground is to keep the Electoral College but adopt reforms that better align outcomes with the popular will\u2014such as nationwide standards for ballot access and recounts, reducing winner-take-all allocation through proportional or district-based awarding of electors, and considering a compact-based approach that activates only with broad state participation. These steps preserve the state-based structure while improving fairness, transparency, and public confidence in presidential elections.",
    "Many Americans value the Electoral College for protecting federalism and encouraging broad geographic coalitions, while others believe it can undermine the principle that every vote should carry equal weight. A pragmatic reform path could preserve the state-based structure but reduce the chance of a popular-vote/electoral-vote mismatch through measures like proportional allocation of electors or a National Popular Vote-style compact with clear safeguards. At the same time, strengthening nationwide voting access, transparency, and post-election audits can build confidence regardless of the system used. Any change should be carefully phased in and paired with bipartisan standards to maintain stability and legitimacy."
