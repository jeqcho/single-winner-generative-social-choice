    "While some value the Electoral College for reinforcing federalism and encouraging broad coalitions, others see it as undermining the principle of one person, one vote and distorting campaign incentives. A practical middle ground is to retain state-based administration but reform outcomes by expanding the use of proportional or district-based elector allocation, adopting uniform standards for elections, and pairing these changes with a national popular-vote safeguard (such as an interstate compact trigger) to ensure the presidency reflects the overall vote. This approach respects states\u2019 roles while reducing the risk of mismatches between the popular will and the final result and improving legitimacy across regions."
