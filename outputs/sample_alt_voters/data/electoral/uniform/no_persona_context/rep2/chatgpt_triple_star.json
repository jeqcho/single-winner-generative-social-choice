    "The Electoral College has value to many as a safeguard for federalism and regional balance, while others see it as outdated and insufficiently aligned with the national popular will. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but modernize incentives so outcomes more closely reflect voters\u2014such as adopting statewide proportional allocation of electors or an interstate compact that effectively ensures the national vote winner prevails once widely adopted. Any reform should be paired with stronger election administration standards, clearer recount rules, and protections for small-state and minority voices to preserve legitimacy and stability.",
    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College to protect federalism and encourage broad geographic coalitions, and others want a direct national popular vote to maximize equal representation, there is room for reforms that improve fairness and legitimacy without discarding the system overnight. A pragmatic approach would set national standards for ballot access and election administration, reduce incentives for winner-take-all outcomes by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors, and add a backstop that guarantees the presidency to the national popular vote winner once a clear majority is reached. These steps preserve the state-based framework while making outcomes more representative and confidence in results more widely shared.",
    "While some Americans favor keeping the Electoral College to preserve the influence of smaller states and federalism, and others want a direct national popular vote for equal voter weight, many can agree the system should better reflect broad public support and strengthen trust in elections. A practical middle path is to retain the state-based structure but reduce \"winner-take-all\" distortions\u2014such as encouraging proportional allocation of electors or a uniform district method\u2014paired with clearer national standards for recounts, election administration, and faithless-elector rules. These reforms would preserve the role of states while making outcomes more representative, transparent, and legitimate.",
    "While some Americans want to keep the Electoral College to protect federalism and encourage broad geographic coalitions, others favor reform to ensure the popular will is reflected more directly and to reduce incentives to focus only on a few swing states. A workable middle ground is to retain the constitutional framework but modernize how states allocate electors\u2014such as expanding proportional or district-based allocation, adopting uniform standards for recounts and election administration, and considering an interstate compact or national threshold that better aligns outcomes with the national vote. These reforms can preserve state roles and regional balance while improving legitimacy, competitiveness, and voter confidence across the country.",
    "The Electoral College can be improved by keeping its role in reflecting state interests while ensuring outcomes better align with the national popular vote and voter confidence. A pragmatic middle ground is to adopt reforms such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or proportional allocation of electoral votes within states, paired with uniform election standards and expanded access to voting. This approach respects federalism concerns, reduces incentives to ignore non-swing states, and increases legitimacy by making every vote matter more equally."
