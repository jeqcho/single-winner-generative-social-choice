    "Any reform to the Electoral College should preserve the goal of broad, nationwide support for the president while strengthening the principle that every vote is counted fairly and transparently. A middle-ground approach could keep the current constitutional framework but reduce distortions by discouraging winner-take-all allocation, setting clear national standards for recounts and election administration, and considering an interstate compact or proportional allocation that better aligns electoral votes with the popular vote. This balances concerns about protecting smaller states\u2019 influence with the widely shared interest in legitimacy, competitiveness, and voter confidence."
