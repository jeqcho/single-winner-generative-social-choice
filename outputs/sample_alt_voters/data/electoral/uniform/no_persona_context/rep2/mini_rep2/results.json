A broad compromise is to keep the Electoral College but end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally (or with a carefully designed district method plus anti-gerrymandering safeguards), and bind electors to the certified result. Pair this with uniform national baseline standards for ballot access, transparent counting timelines, automatic post-election audits, and clear recount triggers so close contests are trusted. If future consensus grows, a National Popular Vote compact and/or ranked-choice voting can be a next step to ensure majority support and encourage cross-regional coalitions.",

A broadly acceptable first step is to end winner-take-all with a fair proportional (or district-based with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) allocation of electors, bind electors to the certified result, and expand the House to reduce distortions. Pair any change with uniform national baseline rules for ballot access, secure counting, multilingual voter support, and automatic audit/recount triggers so close elections are trusted. If the country later prefers a direct popular vote, using ranked-choice (or an automatic runoff) can ensure the winner earns majority support and builds cross-regional coalitions.",
