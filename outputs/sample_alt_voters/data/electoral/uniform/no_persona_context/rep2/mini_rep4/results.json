Pair that with national minimum standards for voter access, ballot design, audits, and automatic recount thresholds so close elections are handled consistently across states. If the public still wants a more direct link to the national will later, states could add ranked-choice ballots for president to ensure majority support without forcing an immediate constitutional overhaul.",

A strong middle path is to end winner-take-all by requiring proportional (or district-based with anti-gerrymandering safeguards) allocation of electors nationwide, bind electors to the certified result, and adopt clear national minimum standards for ballot access, transparent audits, and automatic recount triggers. If further change is needed to ensure majority legitimacy and reduce spoiler fears, states could phase in ranked-choice voting and/or a national popular-vote mechanism (via an amendment or a durable interstate compact) alongside those uniform safeguards.",

The clearest middle ground is to keep the Electoral College but require proportional allocation of electors in every state, bind electors to the certified result, and set national minimum standards for ballot access, secure counting, automatic recount triggers, and post-election audits. If the country later wants to go further, a phased-in national popular vote\u2014ideally using ranked-choice or an automatic runoff\u2014can be considered to ensure the winner has broad majority support and to reduce fears of spoilers.",
