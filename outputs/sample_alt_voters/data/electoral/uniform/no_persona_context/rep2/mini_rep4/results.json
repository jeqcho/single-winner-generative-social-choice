Add guardrails like an independent redistricting requirement if districts are used and enforceable limits on faithless electors to reduce partisan manipulation.",

In parallel, adopt clear national minimum standards for voter access, secure paper ballots, transparent counting, routine post-election audits, and uniform recount/certification timelines to improve legitimacy and reduce litigation. States could optionally join a National Popular Vote interstate compact once these safeguards are in place, and pilot ranked-choice voting where it helps build broader, cross-regional coalitions.",

Any change should come with clear national baselines for voter access, paper-backed ballots, transparent audits, and predictable recount/certification rules, plus protections against gerrymandering and faithless electors. Reforms should be phased in with bipartisan oversight and public reporting to preserve stability, respect smaller states, and strengthen confidence that outcomes reflect voters fairly.",
