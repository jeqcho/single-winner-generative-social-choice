    "A constructive path forward is to preserve the Electoral College\u2019s role in balancing state and national interests while tightening its link to the popular vote and improving transparency and fairness across states. This could include adopting uniform minimum standards for ballot access and vote counting, encouraging proportional or district-based allocation of electors, and reducing \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d distortions so minority voices within states are better reflected. At the same time, safeguards should ensure that close national outcomes can be recounted reliably and that smaller states retain a meaningful role in campaigns, addressing concerns on both sides about legitimacy and representation."
