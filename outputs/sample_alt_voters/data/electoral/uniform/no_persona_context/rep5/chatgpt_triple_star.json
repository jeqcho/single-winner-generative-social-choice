    "A practical middle ground is to keep the Electoral College\u2019s role in certifying results while reducing mismatches between the popular vote and the outcome through reforms like a proportional allocation of electors within each state, clearer nationwide standards for ballot access and recounts, and stronger protections for voting rights. This approach respects federalism and smaller-state concerns while addressing fairness and legitimacy worries voiced by supporters of a national popular vote. Any change should be phased in with broad bipartisan agreement and ensure every vote is counted accurately and transparently.",
    "While opinions differ on whether the Electoral College should be preserved or replaced, many agree the system should better reflect voters\u2019 choices while maintaining confidence across states. A workable middle ground is to keep the constitutional structure but adopt reforms that reduce winner-take-all distortions\u2014such as broader use of proportional or district-based allocation of electors and stronger national standards for election administration. Alongside this, measures like an expanded recount framework and transparency requirements could improve legitimacy without requiring an immediate constitutional overhaul.",
    "While some favor keeping the Electoral College and others want a direct national popular vote, many Americans share goals of fairness, legitimacy, and broad participation in presidential elections. A practical middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but reduce winner-take-all distortions by encouraging proportional allocation of electoral votes or a national popular vote compact with strong recount and election-security standards. Any reform should preserve state administration of elections while ensuring that every vote matters more equally and that close outcomes are resolved transparently and consistently.",
    "Many Americans value the Electoral College\u2019s role in balancing state and national interests, while others worry it can override the popular vote and reduce confidence in election outcomes. A pragmatic middle ground is to keep the constitutional framework but modernize it by encouraging states to allocate electors proportionally or through a national compact that awards electors to the national popular vote winner once enough states join. Paired with uniform voting standards, stronger election security, and expanded access, these reforms could preserve federalism while better reflecting voters\u2019 will and improving legitimacy.",
    "The Electoral College should be modernized to better reflect voters while preserving a meaningful role for states in presidential elections. A practical middle ground is to adopt reforms such as requiring states to allocate electors proportionally or by congressional district, combined with national standards for ballot access, recounts, and election security. This approach respects federalism and smaller-state concerns, yet reduces mismatches between the popular vote and the outcome and strengthens public confidence in the system."
