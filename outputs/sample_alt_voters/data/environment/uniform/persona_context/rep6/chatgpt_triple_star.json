    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals, prioritizing policies that reduce pollution and safeguard ecosystems while enabling businesses and workers to thrive. This can be achieved through clear, predictable standards paired with incentives for innovation, clean infrastructure, and support for communities and industries in transition. By accounting for environmental costs and rewarding efficiency and low-carbon technologies, we can sustain long-term prosperity without sacrificing the natural systems that economies ultimately depend on."
