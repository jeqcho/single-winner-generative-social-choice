    "A sustainable balance is best struck by treating environmental protection as a foundation for long-term economic growth, not an obstacle to it. We can pursue prosperity while setting clear, science-based environmental limits and using market incentives, innovation, and targeted regulation to reduce pollution and resource waste. This approach recognizes the need for jobs and competitiveness today while safeguarding public health, ecosystems, and economic resilience for the future."
