    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as complementary goals by prioritizing development that preserves natural systems while enabling prosperity and jobs. This means setting clear, science-based environmental standards and using market incentives and innovation to meet them at the lowest feasible cost. By investing in clean technologies, resilient infrastructure, and support for affected workers and communities, societies can reduce pollution and risk without stalling economic opportunity."
