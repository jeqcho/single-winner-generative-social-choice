    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals by pursuing development that maintains clean air, water, and stable ecosystems while enabling businesses and workers to prosper. This means setting clear, science-based environmental standards and timelines, while using market incentives, innovation, and targeted support to help industries and communities transition affordably. By prioritizing the highest-impact pollution reductions and investing in resilient infrastructure and clean technologies, we can protect public health and long-term competitiveness without imposing unnecessary burdens."
