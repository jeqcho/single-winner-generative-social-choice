    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals by recognizing that long-term prosperity depends on healthy ecosystems and stable resources. We can support business competitiveness and jobs while setting clear, science-based environmental standards and using flexible tools\u2014such as market incentives, phased timelines, and targeted investment\u2014to help industries and communities adapt.
