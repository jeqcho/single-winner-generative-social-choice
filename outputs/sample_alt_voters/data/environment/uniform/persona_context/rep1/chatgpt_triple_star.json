    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as complementary goals: safeguarding natural systems protects public health and long-term prosperity, while a strong economy provides the resources to invest in cleaner technologies and resilient infrastructure. We can balance near-term costs and benefits by setting clear, science-based environmental standards, giving businesses predictable timelines and incentives to innovate, and prioritizing solutions that reduce pollution while creating jobs. This approach acknowledges economic concerns without sacrificing the environmental foundations that future growth depends on."
