    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals, not competing ones, by prioritizing policies that reduce pollution and resource waste while keeping businesses competitive. This approach recognizes concerns about jobs, affordability, and investment while also acknowledging the long-term costs of environmental damage to health, productivity, and communities. A pragmatic balance is to set clear, science-based environmental standards and pair them with market incentives, innovation support, and transition assistance for affected workers and regions."
