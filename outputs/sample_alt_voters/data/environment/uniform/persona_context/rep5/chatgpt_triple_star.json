    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals by prioritizing policies that reduce pollution and resource waste while sustaining jobs and competitiveness. This means setting clear, evidence-based environmental standards and timelines, paired with incentives and support that help businesses and workers innovate and adapt. By investing in clean technologies, resilient infrastructure, and a just transition for affected communities, we can protect natural systems without sacrificing broad-based prosperity."
