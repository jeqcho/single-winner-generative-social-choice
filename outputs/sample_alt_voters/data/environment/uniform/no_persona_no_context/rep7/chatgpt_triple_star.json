    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be pursued together by prioritizing policies that reduce pollution and resource waste while supporting jobs and competitiveness. This means setting clear, science-based environmental standards and giving businesses predictable timelines and incentives to innovate, rather than choosing between blanket deregulation and abrupt restrictions. By investing in clean energy, resilient infrastructure, and worker transition support, societies can protect natural systems while maintaining broad-based prosperity."
