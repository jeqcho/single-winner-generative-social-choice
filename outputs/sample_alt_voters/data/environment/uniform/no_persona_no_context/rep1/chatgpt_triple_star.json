    "A practical balance is to pursue economic growth while setting clear environmental safeguards that protect public health and long-term ecosystem stability. This means prioritizing policies that price in environmental costs, reward innovation and efficiency, and provide predictable rules for businesses to invest and create jobs. By pairing strong standards with targeted support for affected workers and communities, we can grow the economy today without undermining the natural systems it depends on tomorrow."
