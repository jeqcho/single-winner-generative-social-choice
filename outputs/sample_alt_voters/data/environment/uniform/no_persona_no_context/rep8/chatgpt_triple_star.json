    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals: a healthy environment underpins long-term prosperity, while a strong economy provides resources for cleaner technology and resilience. Policy can balance both by setting clear, science-based environmental standards and pairing them with predictable timelines, incentives, and support for affected workers and industries. This approach encourages innovation and investment while ensuring that economic gains do not come at the expense of public health, ecosystems, or future generations."
