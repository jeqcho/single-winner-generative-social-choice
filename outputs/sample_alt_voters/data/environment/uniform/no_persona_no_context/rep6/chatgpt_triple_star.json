    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals, with policies that safeguard critical ecosystems while enabling businesses and workers to prosper. A balanced approach sets clear, science-based environmental standards and uses market incentives, innovation, and targeted transition support to keep costs manageable and opportunities broad. This way, communities gain cleaner air and water and a stable climate, while the economy benefits from efficiency, resilience, and new industries."
