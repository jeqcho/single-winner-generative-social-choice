    "A workable balance recognizes that protecting the environment and sustaining economic growth are both essential to long-term prosperity and public well-being. We can support growth by setting clear, science-based environmental standards and giving businesses predictable timelines and incentives to innovate, invest in cleaner technology, and create jobs. By prioritizing the highest-impact protections while using market tools, targeted regulation, and support for affected workers and communities, we can reduce harm without unnecessarily slowing opportunity."
