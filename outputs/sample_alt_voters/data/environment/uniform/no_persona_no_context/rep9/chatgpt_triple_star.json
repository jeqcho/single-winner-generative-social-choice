    "Environmental protection and economic growth can be mutually reinforcing when we prioritize long-term prosperity and public health alongside near-term competitiveness. A practical middle ground is to set clear, science-based environmental standards while using market incentives, innovation support, and transition assistance to help businesses and workers adapt. This approach recognizes the costs of regulation and the costs of environmental harm, aiming for predictable rules that drive cleaner investment, resilient infrastructure, and broadly shared economic opportunity."
