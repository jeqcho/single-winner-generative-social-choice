    "A balanced approach should protect critical ecosystems and public health while recognizing the need for jobs, competitiveness, and reliable energy. We can align these goals by setting clear, science-based environmental standards and pairing them with predictable timelines, targeted support for affected workers and industries, and incentives for innovation and clean infrastructure. This way, economic growth is pursued in ways that reduce pollution and risk over time, rather than postponing environmental costs for future generations."
