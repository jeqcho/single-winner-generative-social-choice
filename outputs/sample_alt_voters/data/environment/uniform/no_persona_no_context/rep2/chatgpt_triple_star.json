    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals by prioritizing development that preserves natural resources and reduces long-term risks. This means setting clear, science-based environmental standards while giving businesses predictable timelines, incentives, and support to innovate and adapt. By investing in clean technologies, resilient infrastructure, and job transitions for affected workers, societies can protect ecosystems without sacrificing competitiveness or opportunity."
