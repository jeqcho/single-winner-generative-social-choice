    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals: safeguarding natural systems preserves the resources and stability that economies depend on, while prosperity funds innovation and resilience. A balanced approach prioritizes clear environmental standards and long-term risk reduction, paired with flexible, market-friendly tools and support for businesses and workers to adapt. This means investing in clean technology, phasing in regulations predictably, and ensuring the costs and benefits are shared fairly so communities can grow without degrading the environment."
