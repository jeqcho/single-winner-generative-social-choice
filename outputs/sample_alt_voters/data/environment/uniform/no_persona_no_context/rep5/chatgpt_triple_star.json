    "A workable balance recognizes that strong environmental protections and a healthy economy are interdependent: clean air, water, and stable ecosystems underpin long-term prosperity, while jobs and growth fund innovation and adaptation. We can pursue growth by prioritizing efficiency, clean technologies, and clear, predictable standards that reduce pollution while giving businesses time and incentives to comply. This approach allows for targeted safeguards in high-risk areas and flexible market-based tools elsewhere, so communities benefit both from economic opportunity and a livable environment."
