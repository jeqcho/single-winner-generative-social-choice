    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals by prioritizing policies that reduce pollution and resource waste while supporting jobs, innovation, and competitiveness. This means setting clear, science-based environmental standards and timelines, while giving businesses practical tools\u2014such as incentives, transition support, and market signals\u2014to adapt efficiently. By investing in clean energy, resilient infrastructure, and workforce retraining, we can protect public health and ecosystems without unduly slowing prosperity, and ensure the costs and benefits are shared fairly."
