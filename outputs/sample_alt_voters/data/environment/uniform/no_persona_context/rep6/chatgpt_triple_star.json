    "A balanced approach should protect critical ecosystems and public health while allowing continued economic development through clear, predictable rules and incentives for innovation. Environmental standards can be paired with investments in clean technology, infrastructure, and workforce transitions so businesses can remain competitive as impacts are reduced.
