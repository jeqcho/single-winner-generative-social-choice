    "A sustainable balance recognizes that a strong economy and a healthy environment are interdependent: growth that degrades natural systems ultimately raises costs and risks, while overly rigid rules can disrupt jobs and investment. A practical middle ground is to set clear, science-based environmental standards and predictable timelines, while using market incentives and innovation to help businesses meet them efficiently. This approach protects public health and ecosystems, supports competitiveness, and ensures that workers and communities have support during the transition."
