    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be pursued as mutually reinforcing goals by recognizing that a healthy environment underpins long-term prosperity, while businesses and workers need stability and opportunity in the present. A balanced approach sets clear, science-based environmental limits and uses market incentives, innovation, and targeted public investment to meet them at the lowest cost. It also includes transition support for affected communities and industries, ensuring policies are both effective and fair while encouraging sustainable growth."
