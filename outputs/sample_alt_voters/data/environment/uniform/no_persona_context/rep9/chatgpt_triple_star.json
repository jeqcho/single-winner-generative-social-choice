    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals by setting clear, science-based safeguards while enabling innovation and investment that create jobs and competitiveness. We can pursue growth by pricing and reducing pollution, rewarding efficiency and clean technologies, and streamlining permitting for projects that meet strong standards, while supporting workers and communities through a fair transition. This approach recognizes concerns about costs and livelihoods as well as the urgency of protecting health, ecosystems, and long-term prosperity."
