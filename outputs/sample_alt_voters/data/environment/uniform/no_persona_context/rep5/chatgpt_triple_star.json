    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be pursued together by treating clean air, water, and stable ecosystems as essential foundations for long-term prosperity. We can prioritize practical policies that reduce pollution and emissions while supporting innovation, jobs, and competitiveness through clear standards, phased timelines, and targeted help for affected communities and industries. By investing in efficiency, clean energy, and resilient infrastructure, we can protect natural resources and create durable economic opportunities rather than forcing a zero-sum choice."
