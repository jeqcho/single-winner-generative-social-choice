    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals by aligning markets and policy incentives so that prosperity is built on efficient resource use and low pollution. We can support jobs and competitiveness by prioritizing clean innovation, modern infrastructure, and predictable regulations, while also ensuring workers and communities are helped through fair transition measures. In practice, this means setting clear environmental standards and timelines, using flexible tools like carbon pricing and targeted investments, and regularly reviewing outcomes to protect both ecosystems and economic opportunity."
