    "A balanced approach should protect critical ecosystems and public health while enabling businesses and communities to grow and create jobs. Rather than treating the goals as mutually exclusive, we can set clear, science-based environmental standards and use market incentives, innovation, and targeted support to help industries adapt. This prioritizes long-term prosperity by accounting for the true costs of pollution and resource depletion, while ensuring the transition is practical and fair for workers and regions that would be most affected."
