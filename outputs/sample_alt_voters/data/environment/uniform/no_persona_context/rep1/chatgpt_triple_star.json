    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals, not a zero-sum tradeoff. We can safeguard natural systems by setting clear, science-based environmental standards while supporting businesses through predictable regulation, targeted incentives, and investment in innovation that reduces emissions and waste. This approach protects public health and ecosystems, maintains competitiveness and jobs, and ensures that the costs and benefits of the transition are shared fairly across communities."
