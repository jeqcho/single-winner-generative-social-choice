    "Environmental protection and economic growth need not be treated as opposing goals; a durable approach is to prioritize policies that safeguard public health and critical ecosystems while enabling businesses to innovate and expand. This means setting clear, science-based standards and timelines, pricing or limiting pollution where appropriate, and pairing them with support for affected workers and regions through investment, retraining, and infrastructure. By rewarding efficiency, clean technology, and responsible resource use, societies can create jobs and competitiveness today without undermining the natural systems that economies depend on long term."
