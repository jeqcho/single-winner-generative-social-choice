    "We should pursue a pragmatic balance that recognizes environmental protection and economic growth as mutually reinforcing rather than mutually exclusive goals: protect critical ecosystems and public health through science-based regulations and targeted investment, while promoting sustainable economic opportunities, innovation, and fair transition support for affected workers and communities. By prioritizing cost-effective environmental safeguards, incentivizing green technologies, and allowing flexible market-based mechanisms alongside public oversight, we can sustain prosperity without compromising the natural resources and stability future generations depend on."
