    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as complementary goals: safeguarding natural systems while enabling people and businesses to prosper. A practical middle ground is to set clear, science-based environmental standards and timelines, then use market incentives, innovation, and targeted public investment to help industries meet them without unnecessary disruption. This approach recognizes concerns about jobs and competitiveness while ensuring long-term health, resilience, and cost savings from preventing environmental damage."
