    "We should pursue an approach that recognizes environmental protection and economic growth as mutually reinforcing goals, investing in sustainable technologies, natural capital, and fair transition policies that create jobs while preserving ecosystems. By setting science-based environmental limits, using market-based incentives and targeted regulation, and supporting communities and workers affected by change, we can foster resilient economies that meet present needs without compromising future generations."
