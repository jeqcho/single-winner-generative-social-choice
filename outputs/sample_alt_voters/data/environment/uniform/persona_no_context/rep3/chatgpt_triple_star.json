    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be pursued together by setting clear, science-based environmental safeguards while encouraging innovation and investment that make production cleaner and more efficient. This approach recognizes concerns about jobs, competitiveness, and affordability, while also addressing the long-term costs of pollution and climate risk to public health and the economy. A practical middle ground is to use predictable standards and market incentives, paired with targeted support for workers and communities in transition, so progress is both sustainable and broadly shared."
