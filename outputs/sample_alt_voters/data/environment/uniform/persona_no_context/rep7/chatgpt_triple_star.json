    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals by prioritizing long-term prosperity over short-term gains. We can safeguard ecosystems and public health while supporting jobs by setting clear, predictable environmental standards and investing in innovation, clean infrastructure, and a just transition for affected workers and communities. This approach recognizes the need for competitiveness and affordability, while ensuring the true costs of pollution and resource depletion are addressed."
