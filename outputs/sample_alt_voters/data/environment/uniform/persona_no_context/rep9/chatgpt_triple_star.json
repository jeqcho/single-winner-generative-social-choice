    "A workable balance recognizes that a healthy environment and a strong economy are mutually dependent: protecting air, water, and ecosystems safeguards public health and long-term productivity, while growth provides resources for innovation and jobs. We can pursue development that meets today\u2019s needs without locking in irreversible damage by setting clear, science-based environmental standards and giving businesses flexible, predictable pathways to comply. Investing in clean technologies, efficiency, and resilient infrastructure can reduce pollution while creating competitive industries and well-paid work."
