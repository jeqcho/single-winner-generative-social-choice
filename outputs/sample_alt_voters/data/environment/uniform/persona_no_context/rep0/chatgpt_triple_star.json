    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals: safeguarding ecosystems and public health while enabling jobs and prosperity. A balanced approach sets clear, science-based environmental standards and invests in innovation, efficiency, and cleaner infrastructure so businesses can compete and communities can thrive. Where trade-offs are unavoidable, decisions should be transparent, time-bound, and designed to support affected workers and regions while steadily reducing pollution and resource risk."
