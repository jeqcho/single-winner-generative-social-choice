We can set clear, science-based, measurable standards that hold polluters accountable, while using market-based incentives and streamlined, predictable permitting to help employers innovate and stay competitive. The transition should be phased and paired with workforce training and support for workers and communities\u2014especially in energy, manufacturing, and transportation\u2014so good-paying jobs are protected as we reduce pollution.
