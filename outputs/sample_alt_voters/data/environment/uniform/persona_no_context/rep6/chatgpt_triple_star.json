    "We can protect the environment while supporting economic growth by treating clean air, water, and stable ecosystems as essential infrastructure for long-term prosperity. This means setting clear, science-based environmental standards and predictable timelines, while using market incentives, innovation, and targeted support to help businesses and workers adapt. The goal is pragmatic: reduce pollution and climate risks at the lowest feasible cost, prioritize the highest-impact actions first, and ensure the benefits and burdens are shared fairly across communities and industries."
