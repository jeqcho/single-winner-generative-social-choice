    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals, aiming for prosperity that does not degrade the natural systems people and markets depend on. We can support jobs and competitiveness while setting clear, science-based environmental standards and using market incentives to drive cleaner technologies and more efficient resource use. The balance is best achieved through phased, predictable policies that protect vulnerable communities, help affected workers and industries transition, and prioritize investments that deliver both economic returns and measurable environmental benefits."
