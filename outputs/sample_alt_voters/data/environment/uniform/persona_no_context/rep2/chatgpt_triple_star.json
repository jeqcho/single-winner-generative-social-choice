    "Sustainable prosperity requires that economic growth and environmental protection be pursued together rather than in opposition: policies should promote innovation, clean technologies, and efficient resource use to drive jobs and investment while safeguarding ecosystems and public health. By setting clear environmental standards, incentivizing green business practices, and providing targeted support for communities and industries in transition, we can balance short-term economic needs with long-term planetary stability, honoring both conservation and opportunity."
