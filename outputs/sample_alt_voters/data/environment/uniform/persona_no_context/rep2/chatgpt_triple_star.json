    "A balanced approach recognizes that strong environmental protection and sustained economic growth are both essential, and that ignoring either creates long-term costs. We can pursue growth by prioritizing clean technologies, resource efficiency, and clear, predictable regulations that protect health and ecosystems while giving businesses room to innovate and compete. Where trade-offs are unavoidable, decisions should be guided by transparent evidence, phased implementation, and targeted support for affected workers and communities to ensure a fair transition."
