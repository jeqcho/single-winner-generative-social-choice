Set clear, science-based standards and predictable timelines, then pair them with incentives and financing to help small businesses and working families adopt cleaner, more efficient equipment and energy. Invest in infrastructure and workforce training so workers in energy, construction, transportation, and service jobs can move into good-paying roles without communities being left behind.
