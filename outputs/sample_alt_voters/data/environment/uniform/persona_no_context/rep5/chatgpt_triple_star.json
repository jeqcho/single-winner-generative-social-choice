    "A workable balance treats environmental protection and economic growth as mutually reinforcing goals: a healthy environment underpins long-term prosperity, while a strong economy provides resources for cleaner technology and resilience. We can pursue growth by setting clear, science-based environmental standards and using market-friendly tools\u2014like incentives for innovation and targeted regulations\u2014to cut pollution at the lowest practical cost. This approach protects essential ecosystems and public health while giving businesses predictable rules and support to compete and create jobs in a cleaner economy."
