    "Society should pursue a balanced approach that protects critical ecosystems and public health while enabling sustainable economic opportunities; this means enforcing clear environmental safeguards and investing in green technologies and workforce transitions so businesses and communities can adapt. By combining evidence-based regulation, targeted incentives, and collaborative planning with stakeholders, we can reduce environmental harm without unduly constraining innovation and jobs, recognizing trade-offs and sharing costs equitably."
