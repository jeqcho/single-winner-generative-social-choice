    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be pursued together by prioritizing policies that reduce pollution and conserve natural resources while supporting jobs and competitiveness. A balanced approach recognizes that overly rigid rules can burden businesses, but unchecked environmental harm creates long-term economic and health costs. Governments and industry can align incentives through clear standards, investment in clean technology, and a just transition that helps affected workers and communities adapt."
