    "Sustainable prosperity requires balancing environmental protection with economic growth by pursuing policies that safeguard critical ecosystems and public health while enabling innovation, job creation, and shared prosperity. This approach recognizes legitimate concerns about immediate economic costs and regulatory burden, but emphasizes market-based incentives, targeted investments in clean technologies, and transitional support for affected workers and communities to achieve long-term economic resilience and a healthier environment for current and future generations."
