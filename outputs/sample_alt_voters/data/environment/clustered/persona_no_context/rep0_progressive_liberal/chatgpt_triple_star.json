    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals by prioritizing policies that reduce pollution and resource waste while enabling businesses to innovate and compete. We can acknowledge concerns about costs and jobs by phasing in standards predictably, supporting affected workers and regions, and using market-based incentives where appropriate. At the same time, setting clear long-term environmental targets provides certainty for investment in clean technologies and resilient infrastructure that protects public health and future prosperity."
