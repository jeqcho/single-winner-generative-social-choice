    "A durable balance between environmental protection and economic growth treats a healthy environment as a foundation for long-term prosperity, while recognizing the need for jobs, competitiveness, and affordable energy today. We can pursue growth by investing in cleaner technologies, setting predictable standards that reduce pollution and risk, and using market incentives to reward efficiency and innovation rather than relying solely on bans. At the same time, policies should be phased in with support for affected workers and communities, so the transition is practical, fair, and broadly shared."
