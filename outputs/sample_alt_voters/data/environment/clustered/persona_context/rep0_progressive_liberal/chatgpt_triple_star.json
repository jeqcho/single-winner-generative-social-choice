    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be pursued together by recognizing that healthy ecosystems underpin long-term prosperity, while businesses and workers need predictable pathways to adapt. A balanced approach sets clear environmental standards and market incentives, supports innovation and infrastructure that reduce pollution, and provides transition assistance for communities and industries most affected. This way, we protect public health and natural resources without stalling opportunity, competitiveness, or job creation."
