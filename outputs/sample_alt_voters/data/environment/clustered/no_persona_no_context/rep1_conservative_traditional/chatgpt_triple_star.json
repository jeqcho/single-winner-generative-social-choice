    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals by prioritizing policies that reduce pollution and resource waste while sustaining jobs and competitiveness. This means setting clear environmental standards and timelines, while giving businesses predictable rules, targeted incentives, and support for innovation and worker transitions. By valuing long-term public health and ecosystem stability alongside near-term economic needs, communities can pursue growth that is resilient, efficient, and broadly shared."
