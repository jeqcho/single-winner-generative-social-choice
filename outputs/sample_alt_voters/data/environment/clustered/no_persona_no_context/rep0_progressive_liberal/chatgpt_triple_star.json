    "Environmental protection and economic growth should be treated as mutually reinforcing goals by focusing on policies that reduce pollution and conserve resources while maintaining competitiveness and jobs. This means setting clear, science-based environmental standards and timelines, while using market incentives, innovation, and targeted support to help businesses and workers adapt. By prioritizing investments in clean energy, efficiency, and resilient infrastructure, we can protect public health and ecosystems without imposing unnecessary economic disruption."
