    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger accountability and transparency with a commitment to deliver reliable, fair services that improve people\u2019s daily lives. Those who worry about overreach deserve clear limits, independent oversight, and meaningful consequences for misconduct, while those who value effective governance need institutions with the resources and expertise to act. A practical middle path is to publish measurable performance goals, open decision-making and data where feasible, protect whistleblowers, and create regular channels for community input so institutions can earn trust through consistent results."
