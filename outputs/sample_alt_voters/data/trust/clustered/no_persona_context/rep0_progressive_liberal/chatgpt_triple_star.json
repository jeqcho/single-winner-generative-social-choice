    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with reliable, effective delivery of essential services. Those who worry about overreach can be assured by clear limits on authority, independent oversight, and meaningful consequences for misconduct, while those who emphasize capacity can support investments that improve responsiveness and competence. Creating regular two-way channels for public input\u2014along with open data on decisions and outcomes\u2014can help institutions earn trust through both integrity and performance."
