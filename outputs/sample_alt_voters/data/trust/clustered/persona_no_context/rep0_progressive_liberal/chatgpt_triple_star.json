    "To increase the public's trust in institutions, we should combine greater transparency about decision-making and finances with stronger accountability measures and independent oversight, while also investing in clear, accessible communication and public engagement. This approach respects concerns about corruption and secrecy, addresses calls for fairness and effectiveness, and builds a shared expectation that institutions must both act competently and explain their actions to the people they serve."
