    "To strengthen public trust in institutions, we should pair greater transparency and accountability with a fair recognition of the essential services institutions provide. That means making decisions and data more accessible, enforcing clear standards for ethics and performance, and creating meaningful ways for communities to participate and give feedback. At the same time, reforms should be practical and protect institutional independence, so that trust is built through consistent results rather than partisan pressure."
