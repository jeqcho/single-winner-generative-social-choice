    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to competent, reliable service delivery. This means clearly explaining decisions, publishing evidence and outcomes, and creating independent oversight and accessible ways for people to challenge mistakes\u2014while also protecting institutions from undue political interference so they can function effectively. By engaging communities early, treating people fairly, and measuring performance in ways the public can verify, institutions can earn trust through consistent results rather than slogans."
