    "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are fair, evidence-based, and open to scrutiny, while also delivering reliable services that improve daily life. We can respect concerns about overreach and bias by increasing transparency, independent oversight, and clear accountability for mistakes, without undermining institutions\u2019 capacity to act effectively. At the same time, institutions should engage communities in decision-making and communicate with humility and clarity, so skepticism is addressed with verifiable information and consistent performance."
