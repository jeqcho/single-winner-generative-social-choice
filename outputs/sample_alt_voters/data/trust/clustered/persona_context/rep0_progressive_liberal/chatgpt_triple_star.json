    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with practical improvements in everyday service and outcomes. People who are skeptical deserve clear evidence\u2014open data, independent audits, and real consequences for misconduct\u2014while those who value stable institutions deserve reforms that strengthen competence and fairness rather than weaken capacity. Building trust also means creating regular, inclusive ways for communities to shape decisions and receive timely, honest communication, especially when mistakes occur."
