    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair greater transparency and accountability with a commitment to effective, stable service delivery. People who worry about corruption and bias deserve clear reporting, independent oversight, and real consequences for misconduct, while those concerned about polarization and undercutting expertise deserve processes that protect professionalism and evidence-based decisions. A practical middle ground is to set measurable standards, open decision-making and data where possible, invite meaningful public input, and regularly audit results so institutions earn trust through consistent performance."
