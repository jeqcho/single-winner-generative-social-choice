    "Trust in institutions can grow when they consistently deliver fair, effective services while being transparent about decisions, mistakes, and limits. Those who emphasize accountability can support strong oversight, clear ethics rules, and consequences for misconduct, while those who worry about bureaucracy can support simpler processes, measurable results, and regular independent evaluations. Creating meaningful channels for public input\u2014and demonstrating that feedback changes outcomes\u2014can strengthen legitimacy without sacrificing expertise."
