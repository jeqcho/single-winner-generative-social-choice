    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a fair recognition of the difficult work institutions do to serve the public. That means clear standards, independent oversight, open data where appropriate, and meaningful consequences for misconduct, alongside better communication, simpler services, and consistent treatment for everyone. By making decision-making more understandable, responsive, and evidence-based while protecting due process and expertise, we can rebuild trust without weakening the institutions people rely on."
