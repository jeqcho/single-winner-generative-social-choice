    "Building public trust in institutions requires both stronger accountability and genuine engagement with the communities they serve. People who emphasize reform are right to demand transparency, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct, while those who value institutional stability are right that effective services depend on capable, predictable governance. A practical middle ground is to pair clear performance standards and open data with participatory decision-making and consistent, fair enforcement of rules so trust is earned through results and integrity over time."
