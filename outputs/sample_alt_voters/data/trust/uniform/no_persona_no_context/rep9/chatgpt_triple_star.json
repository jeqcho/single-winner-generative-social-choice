    "Public trust in institutions grows when people see that rules are applied fairly, decisions are transparent, and leaders are accountable for mistakes. We can respect concerns about overreach and bureaucracy while also recognizing that effective institutions are essential for public safety, rights, and shared prosperity. A practical middle ground is to pair stronger oversight and open data with better service delivery and meaningful public participation\u2014so institutions earn trust through measurable performance and responsiveness rather than demands for deference."
