    "Building public trust in institutions requires both stronger accountability and a clearer demonstration of the value institutions provide. We can respect concerns about overreach and past failures while still recognizing that effective schools, courts, health agencies, and other public bodies are essential to a stable society. A practical middle ground is to increase transparency, independent oversight, and meaningful public participation, while setting measurable performance goals and enforcing consequences when standards aren\u2019t met."
