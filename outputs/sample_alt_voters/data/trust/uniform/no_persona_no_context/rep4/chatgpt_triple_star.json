    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a renewed focus on effective, fair service delivery. People who value stability are right that institutions need consistent rules and professional expertise, while skeptics are right that errors, conflicts of interest, and uneven outcomes must be openly acknowledged and corrected. A practical middle ground is to publish clear performance metrics, strengthen independent oversight, and create meaningful avenues for public input so decisions are both evidence-based and demonstrably responsive to communities."
