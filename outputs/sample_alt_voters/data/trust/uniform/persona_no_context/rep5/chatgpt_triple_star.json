    "To increase the general public's trust in institutions, we should strengthen transparency, accountability, and community engagement so institutions are open about decisions, answerable for outcomes, and responsive to citizens\u2019 concerns. This approach respects calls for independent oversight and reform while acknowledging institutions\u2019 need for legitimate authority and expertise, and it prioritizes practical measures\u2014clear communication, accessible data, routine performance reviews, and meaningful public input\u2014that most stakeholders can support."
