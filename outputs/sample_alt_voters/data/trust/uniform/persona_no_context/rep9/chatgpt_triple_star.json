    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with reliable delivery of essential services and fair treatment for all. People who want reform deserve clear data, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct, while those who value stability need institutions to remain effective, lawful, and insulated from partisan swings. Building trust requires open communication, meaningful public input, and consistent standards that demonstrate both competence and integrity over time."
