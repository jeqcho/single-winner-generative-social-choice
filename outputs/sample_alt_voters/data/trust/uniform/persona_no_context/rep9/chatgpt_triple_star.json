    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and accountability measures with meaningful community engagement so institutions both explain decisions clearly and demonstrate they act on public interests. This approach recognizes the need for rigorous oversight and factual communication while also valuing local input and responsiveness, creating practical standards and regular public reporting to rebuild confidence across diverse constituencies."
