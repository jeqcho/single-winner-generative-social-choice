    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with better communication and reliable service delivery. People who worry about overreach deserve clear rules, independent oversight, and real consequences for mistakes, while those who value effective institutions need stable funding and the capacity to solve problems. Building trust requires consistent performance, open data and decision-making, and meaningful ways for communities to participate and be heard."
