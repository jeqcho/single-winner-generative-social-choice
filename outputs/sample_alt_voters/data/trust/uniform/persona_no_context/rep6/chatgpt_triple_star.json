    "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should commit to transparent decision-making, consistent accountability, and accessible communication that explains both goals and limitations; this encourages engagement from those who seek reform while reassuring those who value stability. By establishing independent oversight, improving responsiveness to community concerns, and investing in clear public education about processes and outcomes, institutions can build credibility without sacrificing effectiveness."
