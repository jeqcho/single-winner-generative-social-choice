    "To increase public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to transparent decision-making, consistent accountability, and inclusive public engagement so people see how policies are made and who is responsible for outcomes. While recognizing differences in priorities and skepticism, institutions can build credibility by improving communication, demonstrating results through independent oversight, and creating accessible channels for community input and remediation."
