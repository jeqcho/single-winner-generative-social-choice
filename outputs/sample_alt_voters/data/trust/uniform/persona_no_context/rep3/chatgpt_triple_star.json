    "Increasing public trust in institutions requires both better performance and greater openness: institutions should deliver reliable results while being transparent about how decisions are made and how resources are used. People who emphasize accountability can be met with stronger independent oversight, clear consequences for misconduct, and meaningful public input, while those who worry about undermining expertise can be reassured by protecting professional standards and evidence-based policymaking. A practical middle ground is to set measurable service goals, publish easy-to-understand data on outcomes, and create regular feedback loops that lead to visible improvements."
