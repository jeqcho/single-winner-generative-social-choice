    "To strengthen public trust in institutions, we should combine increased transparency and accountability with meaningful public engagement and independent oversight, ensuring decisions are explainable and consequences for misconduct are enforced. Recognizing that people value both competence and fairness, institutions should prioritize clear communication, accessible data, and inclusive mechanisms for input while protecting against politicization and respecting expertise."
