    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and accountability measures with meaningful community engagement and independent oversight, ensuring decisions are both understandable and responsive to public concerns. Recognizing that some prioritize efficiency while others emphasize caution and equity, institutions must commit to clear communication, regular performance audits, and inclusive channels for feedback so that outcomes are fair, evidence-based, and continuously improved by public input."
