    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and accountability measures with inclusive community engagement, ensuring decisions and data are openly available while actively soliciting and addressing diverse public concerns. By investing in independent oversight, clear communication, and demonstrable outcomes that protect public interests, institutions can bridge political and cultural divides and rebuild confidence across communities."
