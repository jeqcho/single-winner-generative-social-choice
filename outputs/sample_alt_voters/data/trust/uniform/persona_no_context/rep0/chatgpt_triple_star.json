    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a clear recognition of the essential services institutions provide. That means making decisions and data easier to understand, creating independent oversight and meaningful consequences for misconduct, and ensuring people can participate and be heard through accessible feedback and appeals. At the same time, reforms should protect institutions from undue politicization so they can operate fairly, consistently, and competently for everyone."
