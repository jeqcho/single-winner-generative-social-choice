    "To strengthen public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to consistent transparency, independent oversight, and meaningful opportunities for public input while safeguarding expertise and effective decision-making. Recognizing legitimate concerns about bias and inefficiency, institutions should adopt clearer accountability measures, open data practices, and regular community engagement so diverse perspectives can be heard and incorporated without undermining necessary standards and expertise."
