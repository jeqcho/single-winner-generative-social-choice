    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair greater transparency and accountability with a recognition that effective institutions are essential for delivering services, enforcing fair rules, and solving shared problems. This means setting clear standards, measuring performance openly, investigating and correcting failures, and strengthening independent oversight\u2014while also investing in frontline capacity so institutions can reliably meet the public\u2019s needs. At the same time, institutions should engage communities in decision-making, communicate with evidence and humility, and protect equal treatment so both skeptics and supporters can see that trust is earned through consistent results and integrity."
