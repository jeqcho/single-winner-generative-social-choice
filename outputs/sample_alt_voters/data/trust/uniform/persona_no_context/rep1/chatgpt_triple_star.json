    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should commit to transparent decision-making, independent oversight, and clear, regular communication that explains both actions and limits of authority. While some will prioritize efficiency and others demand accountability, we can find common ground by enshrining robust checks and accessible public reporting, investing in ethical training and community engagement, and creating straightforward avenues for feedback and redress."
