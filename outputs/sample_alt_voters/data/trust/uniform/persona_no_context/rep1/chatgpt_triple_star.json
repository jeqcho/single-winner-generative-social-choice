    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should strengthen transparency, accountability, and community engagement while protecting independent oversight and evidence-based decision-making. By combining clearer communication of decisions and outcomes, robust mechanisms to address misconduct, and meaningful opportunities for public input, institutions can balance expert guidance with democratic responsiveness and regain broader confidence."
