    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a clear commitment to competence and reliable service delivery. People who worry about corruption deserve independent oversight, open data, and consequences for wrongdoing, while those who worry about stability deserve reforms that protect essential functions and avoid partisan swings. Trust grows when institutions explain decisions in plain language, invite meaningful public input, and consistently deliver fair outcomes across communities."
