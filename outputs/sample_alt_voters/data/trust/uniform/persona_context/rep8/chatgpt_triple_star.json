    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with reliable, effective delivery of essential services. People who emphasize skepticism deserve clear evidence\u2014open data, independent audits, and consequences for misconduct\u2014while those who value stability need institutions that can act decisively and competently. A practical middle path is to expand public participation and oversight, reduce conflicts of interest, and communicate decisions plainly so trust is earned through both performance and integrity."
