    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a clear commitment to competent, reliable public service. People who are skeptical deserve accessible information, independent oversight, and real consequences for misconduct, while those who value stability need reforms that protect institutional capacity rather than weaken it. A practical middle ground is to make decisions and data easier to scrutinize, invite meaningful public participation, and focus on measurable outcomes that improve everyday life."
