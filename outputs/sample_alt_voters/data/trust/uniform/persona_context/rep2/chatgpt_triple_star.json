    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a renewed focus on delivering competent, fair, and reliable services. People who emphasize oversight are right to demand clear standards, independent audits, and consequences for misconduct, while those who worry about stability are right that reforms should preserve institutional capacity and avoid politicized attacks. A practical middle ground is to make decision-making and performance measurable and publicly accessible, invite ongoing community input, and protect integrity through nonpartisan ethics enforcement so trust is earned through consistent results."
