    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with consistent, high-quality service that people can see and measure. Those who worry about overreach deserve clear limits, independent oversight, and open data; those who value effective governance deserve stable funding, professional standards, and room to innovate. A practical path forward is to set shared performance goals, publish results regularly, and create accessible channels for public input and redress so institutions earn trust through both integrity and competence."
