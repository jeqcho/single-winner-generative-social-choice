    "Building public trust in institutions should focus on making them more transparent, accountable, and responsive, while recognizing that many people\u2019s skepticism comes from real experiences of failure or exclusion. We can strengthen trust by setting clear standards for ethics and performance, publishing evidence behind decisions, and creating independent oversight with meaningful consequences for misconduct. At the same time, institutions should actively engage communities, invite feedback, and show measurable improvements in services so trust is earned through consistent results rather than demanded by authority."
