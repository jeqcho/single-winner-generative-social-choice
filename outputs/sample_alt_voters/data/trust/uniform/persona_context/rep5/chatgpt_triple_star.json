    "Public trust in institutions can be strengthened by pairing strong performance with stronger accountability: delivering reliable services while being transparent about decisions, data, and mistakes. Institutions should create meaningful, nonpartisan ways for people to participate and be heard\u2014especially those who feel left out\u2014while maintaining clear standards, rule of law, and professional expertise. At the same time, the public and media can support trust by demanding evidence, resisting misinformation, and judging institutions by consistent results rather than partisan loyalty."
