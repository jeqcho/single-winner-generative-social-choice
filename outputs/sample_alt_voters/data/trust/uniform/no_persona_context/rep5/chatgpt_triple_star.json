    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with practical reforms that improve everyday performance and fairness. People who value stability need institutions that are reliable and insulated from undue political pressure, while skeptics need clear evidence\u2014through open data, independent oversight, and real consequences for misconduct\u2014that power is being checked. By setting measurable service standards, inviting meaningful public input, and communicating decisions plainly, institutions can earn trust through both integrity and results."
