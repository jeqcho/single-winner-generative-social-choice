    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with reliable, high-quality service that people can see and measure. Those who worry about overreach deserve clear rules, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct, while those who value effective governance need institutions that are well-funded, professional, and able to deliver results. By publishing performance data, protecting whistleblowers, engaging communities in decisions, and enforcing fair standards consistently, institutions can rebuild credibility across political and cultural divides."
