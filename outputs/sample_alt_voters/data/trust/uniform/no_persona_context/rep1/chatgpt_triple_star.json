    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair strong accountability and transparency with fair recognition of the essential services institutions provide. That means making decisions and data more accessible, setting clear performance standards, and enforcing consequences for misconduct, while also investing in competent staffing and stable resources. Institutions should actively listen to communities\u2014especially those historically underserved\u2014through independent oversight and meaningful public input, so reforms are shaped by real experiences rather than partisan narratives."
