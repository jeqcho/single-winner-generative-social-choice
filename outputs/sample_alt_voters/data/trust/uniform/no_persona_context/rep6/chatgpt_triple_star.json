    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair greater transparency and accountability with sustained investment in competent, fair service delivery. Those who worry about overreach and those who fear under-resourcing can agree on clear standards, independent oversight, and open data that show how decisions are made and whether outcomes improve. Trust grows when institutions admit mistakes, correct them promptly, and consistently engage communities in shaping priorities while protecting equal rights and due process."
