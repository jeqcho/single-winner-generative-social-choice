    "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair greater transparency and accountability with consistent, high-quality service that people can see and measure. This means openly sharing how decisions are made, auditing performance, and addressing misconduct, while also giving institutions the resources and independence needed to deliver results and resist undue influence. By creating clear standards, accessible oversight, and meaningful opportunities for public input, we can rebuild confidence without assuming institutions are either irredeemable or beyond criticism."
