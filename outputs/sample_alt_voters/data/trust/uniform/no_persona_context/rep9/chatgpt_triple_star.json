    "Building public trust in institutions requires pairing stronger transparency and accountability with a clear recognition of the complex work institutions do. We can agree on making decisions and data more accessible, enforcing consistent standards and independent oversight, and creating meaningful ways for communities to give input and see results. At the same time, reforms should protect due process, professional expertise, and stability so improvements strengthen performance rather than simply shifting power or blame."
