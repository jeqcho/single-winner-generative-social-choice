    "Policing should prioritize public safety while protecting civil rights by using transparent, accountable practices that are evidence-based and community-informed. Agencies can balance these goals through clear use-of-force limits, independent oversight, training in de-escalation and bias reduction, and partnerships with community stakeholders to address underlying causes of crime and build mutual trust."
