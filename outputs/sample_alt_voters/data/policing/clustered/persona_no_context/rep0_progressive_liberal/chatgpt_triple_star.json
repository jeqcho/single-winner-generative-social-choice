    "Policing should be guided by a dual commitment to protecting public safety and upholding civil rights, recognizing that trust and effectiveness depend on both. A balanced approach pairs clear limits on use of force and strong accountability (transparent reporting, independent oversight, and fair discipline) with the resources officers need for crime prevention, rapid response, and victim support. Investing in de-escalation training, community partnerships, and targeted, evidence-based enforcement\u2014alongside alternatives for mental health and low-level issues\u2014can reduce harm while keeping neighborhoods safe."
