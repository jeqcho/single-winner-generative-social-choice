    "Policing should prioritize public safety while upholding civil rights by combining clear, constitutional use-of-force limits and accountability with community-centered practices that build trust and prevent crime. This approach recognizes the need for effective law enforcement to protect people and property, while also committing to transparency, independent oversight, de-escalation training, and investments in alternatives for mental health and social services to reduce reliance on armed response."
