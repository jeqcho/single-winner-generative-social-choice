    "Policing should prioritize public safety while upholding civil rights by combining evidence-based, community-centered practices with clear accountability and transparency measures. This approach recognizes the need for effective law enforcement to prevent crime and protect vulnerable communities, while also committing to bias reduction, respectful de-escalation, independent oversight, and ongoing training to safeguard constitutional liberties for all."
