    "Policing should aim to keep communities safe while upholding civil rights through clear standards for lawful, proportionate, and accountable enforcement. A balanced approach pairs targeted, evidence-based strategies and strong community partnerships with transparent oversight, de-escalation training, and safeguards against bias. This allows officers to respond effectively to serious harm while ensuring residents have meaningful protections and trust in how policing is carried out."
