    "Policing should prioritize public safety while upholding civil rights by combining transparent, accountable practices with community-centered engagement and clear use-of-force limits. This balance respects the need for effective law enforcement to prevent and respond to crime while ensuring oversight, bias-reduction training, and accessible complaint mechanisms so that all community members are treated with dignity and constitutional protections."
