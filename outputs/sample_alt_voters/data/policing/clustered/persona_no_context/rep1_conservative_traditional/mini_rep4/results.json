Officers should be well trained and supported in de-escalation, crisis response, and respectful communication, with body cameras and transparent reporting used to document actions and learn from mistakes. Communities benefit when police partner with residents and use targeted enforcement against repeat violent offenders, while routing mental-health and low-level social issues to non-police or co-responder teams when appropriate. These practical steps strengthen trust, improve safety, and protect both the public and the officers who serve it.",
