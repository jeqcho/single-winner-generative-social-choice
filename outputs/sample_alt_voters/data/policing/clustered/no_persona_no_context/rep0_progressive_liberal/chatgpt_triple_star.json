    "Policing should be guided by a dual commitment to protecting public safety and upholding civil rights, recognizing that communities need both effective crime prevention and fair, respectful treatment. A balanced approach prioritizes de-escalation, clear use-of-force standards, and training while also ensuring accountability through transparent data, independent oversight, and meaningful avenues for community input. Resources should be targeted based on evidence\u2014focusing on serious harm and repeat violence\u2014while minimizing unnecessary low-level enforcement that can erode trust. This framework aims to reduce crime and improve legitimacy by making safety and rights reinforcing rather than competing goals."
