To get there, departments can set clear, publicly known standards for stops, searches, and use of force; require documented, reviewable decisions; and use independent auditing of results such as injuries, complaints, clearance rates, and racial disparities. Pairing these safeguards with strong training in de-escalation and referrals to non-police responders for behavioral-health and homelessness calls can reduce unnecessary contact while keeping communities safe.",

That balance is best achieved with strong de-escalation and bias-aware training, clear use-of-force standards, and transparent, independently reviewed data on stops, complaints, and outcomes. Communities and officers should jointly set measurable goals, and when appropriate, route mental-health and nonviolent crises to specialized responders so police can focus on serious threats while reducing unnecessary confrontation.",
