    "Policing should prioritize public safety while protecting civil rights by combining targeted, evidence-based strategies with clear limits, transparency, and meaningful accountability. Communities can support focused interventions against serious violence and repeat harm when they are paired with de-escalation, bias reduction, and strong oversight that prevents unnecessary or discriminatory stops and force. Shared goals\u2014safer neighborhoods and fair treatment\u2014are best advanced through measurable outcomes, community partnership, and policies that reward lawful, respectful policing and correct failures quickly."
