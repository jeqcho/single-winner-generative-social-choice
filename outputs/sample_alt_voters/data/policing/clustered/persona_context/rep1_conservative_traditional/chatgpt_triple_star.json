    "Policing should be guided by a dual commitment: preventing harm and protecting civil rights, recognizing that trust and safety reinforce each other. A balanced approach emphasizes clear standards for use of force, de-escalation and bias-aware training, transparent accountability, and data-driven deployment focused on serious harm rather than broad low-level enforcement. At the same time, it supports adequate staffing and partnerships with community and social services so officers can respond effectively while minimizing unnecessary intrusion. This framework respects concerns about crime and disorder while addressing concerns about discrimination and overreach through measurable safeguards and public oversight."
