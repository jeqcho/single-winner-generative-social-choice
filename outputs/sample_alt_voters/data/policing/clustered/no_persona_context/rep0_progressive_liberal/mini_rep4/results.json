Accountability should be swift and credible through independent investigation, public reporting of outcomes and key data, and fair due process for both residents and officers. Day-to-day safety improves when departments co-design priorities with communities, use early-warning and supervision to prevent misconduct, and route appropriate calls to mental-health, substance-use, and other civilian-led responders. Combined with adequate training, wellness support, and resources for officers, these measures reduce unnecessary confrontations while strengthening trust and legitimacy.",
