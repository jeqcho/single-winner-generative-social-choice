    "Policing should focus on preventing harm while upholding constitutional rights, recognizing that communities need both effective safety measures and fair, respectful treatment. A balanced approach pairs targeted, evidence-based enforcement with clear limits on use of force, strong accountability and transparency, and independent oversight to maintain public trust. Investing in de-escalation training, data-driven evaluation, and partnerships with social services and community leaders can reduce crime and unnecessary encounters while protecting civil liberties."
