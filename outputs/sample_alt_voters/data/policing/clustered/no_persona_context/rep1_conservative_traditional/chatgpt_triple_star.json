    "Policing strategies should aim to reduce harm and protect communities while upholding constitutional rights through clear rules, transparency, and accountability. A balanced approach pairs targeted, evidence-based deployment and problem-solving partnerships with strong safeguards such as de-escalation training, proportional use-of-force standards, independent oversight, and rigorous data collection to detect and correct bias. This recognizes the need for public safety and for trust built on fair, respectful treatment, so that enforcement is both effective and legitimate."
