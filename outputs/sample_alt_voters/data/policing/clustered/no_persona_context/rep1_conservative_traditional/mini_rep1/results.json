That means narrowly tailored laws and stops, a force continuum that prioritizes time/distance and de-escalation, and prompt, independent investigation and discipline when standards are violated, with results reported publicly. Pair these guardrails with co-responder or civilian-led responses for behavioral-health and quality-of-life calls, targeted enforcement on violent crime, and officer training and wellness so the system is both effective and rights-respecting.",
