    "Policing should aim to keep communities safe while protecting civil rights by prioritizing evidence-based, proportional responses and clear constitutional standards for stops, searches, and use of force. Many people want both effective crime reduction and fair, respectful treatment, so agencies should combine training and support for de-escalation with strong accountability\u2014transparent data, independent oversight, and meaningful consequences for misconduct.
