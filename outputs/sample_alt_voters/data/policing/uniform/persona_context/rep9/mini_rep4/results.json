Independent review of serious incidents, accessible complaint processes, and routine public reporting of stops, uses of force, and outcomes can ensure accountability and continuous improvement without undermining effective enforcement. Pairing law enforcement with mental-health and community-based responders for appropriate calls, and supporting officers with fair staffing, wellness resources, and body-worn camera standards, helps prevent harm and strengthens legitimacy across neighborhoods.",
