    "Policing should aim to protect public safety while treating civil rights as a core requirement, not a tradeoff, by prioritizing evidence-based practices that reduce harm and crime. A balanced approach can combine clear constitutional limits, transparent accountability, and community partnership with adequate staffing, training, and support for officers to respond effectively. Policies like de-escalation, narrowly tailored use-of-force standards, data-driven oversight, and targeted enforcement of serious violence can help build trust while maintaining safety."
