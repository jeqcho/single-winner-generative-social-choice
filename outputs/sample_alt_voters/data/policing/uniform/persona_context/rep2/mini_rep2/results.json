Departments should set clear, publicly known rules for stops, searches, and use of force; train and reward de-escalation and problem-solving; and ensure swift, independent investigation and fair discipline when rules are broken. Co-responder and non-police options for behavioral-health and low-level community issues, paired with transparent data on outcomes and disparities, can reduce unnecessary encounters while helping officers focus on serious harm. Regular community input, strong privacy protections for technology, and support for officer wellness and professionalism are essential to sustaining trust and safety over time.",
