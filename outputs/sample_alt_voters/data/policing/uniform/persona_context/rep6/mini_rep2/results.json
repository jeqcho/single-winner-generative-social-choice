Communities are best served when nonviolent crises are routed to specialized mental-health and social-service responders, while officers are equipped with adequate staffing, wellness support, and fair discipline to meet high standards. This approach protects safety and civil rights by aligning tactics, accountability, and resources with measurable reductions in violence and unnecessary intrusions.",
