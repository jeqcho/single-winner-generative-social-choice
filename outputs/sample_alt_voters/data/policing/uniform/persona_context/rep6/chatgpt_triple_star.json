    "Policing should be guided by a dual commitment to public safety and the protection of civil rights, recognizing that communities need both security and fair, respectful treatment. A balanced approach prioritizes prevention and de-escalation, uses force only when necessary and proportional, and pairs this with clear accountability through transparent policies, independent oversight, and reliable data. At the same time, effective crime reduction can be supported by targeted, evidence-based deployments and strong partnerships with residents to build trust and legitimacy."
