    "Policing should be guided by the shared goals of public safety and equal protection, recognizing that communities want both effective crime prevention and assurance that rights are respected. A reasonable approach pairs clear accountability and constitutional, bias-aware practices with practical tools that reduce harm\u2014such as de-escalation, proportional use-of-force standards, and transparent data and oversight\u2014while ensuring officers have training and support to respond effectively. Focusing enforcement on serious violence, strengthening partnerships and alternatives for nonviolent crises, and measuring outcomes for both safety and fairness can build trust and improve results for everyone."
