    "Policing strategies should aim to keep communities safe while rigorously protecting civil rights, recognizing that public trust is essential to effective crime prevention. A balanced approach combines targeted, evidence-based enforcement for serious violence with strong accountability measures\u2014clear use-of-force standards, independent oversight, and transparent data\u2014so power is exercised fairly. Investing in de-escalation training, community partnership, and non-police responses for behavioral health and low-level issues can reduce harm while allowing officers to focus on threats that genuinely endanger residents."
