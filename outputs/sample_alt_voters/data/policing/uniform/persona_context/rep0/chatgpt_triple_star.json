    "Policing should prioritize public safety while protecting civil rights by focusing on evidence-based, narrowly tailored tactics, transparent standards, and clear accountability for misconduct. This approach can recognize concerns about crime and disorder while also addressing fears of over-policing through de-escalation training, bias safeguards, and proportional enforcement. Building trust requires community partnership, independent oversight, and reliable data on stops, use of force, and outcomes so policies can be evaluated and improved."
