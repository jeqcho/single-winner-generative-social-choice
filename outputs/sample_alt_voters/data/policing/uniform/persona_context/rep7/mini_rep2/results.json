That requires clear, consistently enforced use-of-force and stop standards; strong supervision and independent review; and transparent reporting that protects privacy while enabling accountability. Safety improves when police focus on serious harm, use trained de-escalation as the default, and route mental-health and low-level social crises to appropriate responders supported by community-based services. Ongoing community input, fair labor supports, and early-warning systems for misconduct can reduce unnecessary encounters, protect civil liberties, and strengthen legitimacy.",
