This requires clear limits on force, continual scenario-based de-escalation and impartiality training, and transparent, independent review of serious incidents, paired with early-intervention systems that correct problems before they escalate. Communities should have real input into priorities and outcomes, while non-police responders and social-service partners handle many behavioral-health, housing, and youth issues so officers can focus on serious crime. With measurable goals, privacy safeguards for technology, and strong support and accountability for officers, departments can reduce harm and earn durable public trust.",
