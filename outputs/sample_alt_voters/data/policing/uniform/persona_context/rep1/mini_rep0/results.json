Officers should be trained and supported to resolve situations safely through de-escalation, bias-aware and trauma-informed practice, and consistent discipline when standards are violated. Communities should expand non-police responses for mental-health, addiction, and homelessness crises, and invest in prevention and youth supports, while maintaining focused, evidence-based enforcement for serious and repeat harm.
