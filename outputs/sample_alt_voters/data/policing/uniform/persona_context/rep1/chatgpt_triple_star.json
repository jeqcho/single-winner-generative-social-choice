    "Policing should focus on keeping communities safe while protecting civil rights by using clear, constitutional policies that prioritize de-escalation, proportionality, and intervention only when necessary. Departments can build trust and effectiveness through transparent accountability (including independent oversight and accessible data), consistent training, and support for officers\u2019 well-being and professionalism. A balanced approach pairs targeted enforcement against serious harm with community partnership and investments in prevention, so public safety and civil liberties are treated as mutually reinforcing goals."
