    "Policing should aim to keep communities safe while protecting civil rights by pairing effective crime prevention with clear limits on authority, transparency, and meaningful accountability. That means prioritizing evidence-based approaches\u2014like targeted enforcement, de-escalation, and problem-solving with community partners\u2014while ensuring strong oversight, body-worn camera policies, fair complaint processes, and data reporting to prevent bias and misuse. By focusing resources where harm is greatest and measuring success by both safety outcomes and rights-respecting conduct, departments can build trust and improve legitimacy across different communities."
