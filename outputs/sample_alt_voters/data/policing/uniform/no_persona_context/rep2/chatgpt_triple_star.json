    "Policing strategies should aim to reduce harm and keep communities safe while upholding constitutional rights through clear limits on force, transparent accountability, and equal treatment under the law. A balanced approach pairs targeted, evidence-based enforcement for serious violence with robust de-escalation training, community partnership, and services that address underlying problems, so officers are not the default response to every crisis. Consistent data collection, independent oversight, and early-warning systems can build trust by showing both that misconduct is addressed and that effective policing is recognized and improved."
