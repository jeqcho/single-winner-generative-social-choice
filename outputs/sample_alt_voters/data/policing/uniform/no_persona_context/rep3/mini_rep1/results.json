That requires well-defined, consistently applied policies (especially for stops, searches, and force), strong supervision with early-warning systems and proportional discipline, and independent review of serious incidents. Cities should triage calls so armed officers focus on violence and investigations, while trained civilian or co-responder teams handle many behavioral-health, homelessness, and minor-dispute calls, backed by transparent reporting and regular community feedback to measure results and protect rights.",
