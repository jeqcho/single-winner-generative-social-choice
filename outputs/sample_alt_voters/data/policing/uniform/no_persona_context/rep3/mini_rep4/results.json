Communities should have sustained partnerships and input, supported by open (privacy-protected) data, body-worn camera policies, and measurable outcome metrics to ensure fair, predictable enforcement. Pairing law enforcement with specialized mental-health crisis response and other community-based services can reduce unnecessary force and improve long-term safety, while ensuring officers have the training, resources, and wellness support to meet these standards.",

Nonviolent mental-health and social-service calls should be matched with specialized responders when appropriate, so officers can focus on serious crime and emergencies. Trust grows when departments use body-worn cameras with privacy safeguards, publish key outcome data, and rely on fair, independent oversight that also supports officer training, wellness, and accountability. Community input and measurable results should guide continuous improvement so safety and civil liberties are strengthened together.",
