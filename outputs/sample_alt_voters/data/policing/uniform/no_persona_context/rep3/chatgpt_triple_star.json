    "Policing should be guided by a dual mandate: protect public safety while upholding constitutional rights and treating all people with dignity. A balanced approach prioritizes prevention and de-escalation, uses narrowly tailored and accountable enforcement when necessary, and pairs strong oversight and transparency with meaningful community input. With clear standards, independent review, and data-driven evaluation, departments can reduce crime and harm while strengthening trust and legitimacy."
