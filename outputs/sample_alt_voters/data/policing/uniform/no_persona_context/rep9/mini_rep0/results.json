Reduce unnecessary enforcement by routing behavioral-health, substance-use, and other nonviolent calls to specialized responders and community programs, while ensuring officers have support and resources to focus on serious crime. Regular, structured community input and evidence-based evaluation should guide adjustments so safety gains do not come at the expense of equal treatment under the law.",
