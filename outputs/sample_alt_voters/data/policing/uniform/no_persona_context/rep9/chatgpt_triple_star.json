    "Policing should prioritize public safety while protecting civil rights by focusing on evidence-based practices, clear constitutional standards, and transparency in how authority is used. This means investing in training, de-escalation, and non-police crisis responses where appropriate, while also setting firm accountability measures\u2014such as body cameras, independent review, and reliable data reporting\u2014to address misconduct. A balanced approach can recognize communities\u2019 concerns about both crime and overreach, aiming for effective enforcement that is fair, proportional, and earns public trust."
