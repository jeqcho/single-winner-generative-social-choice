Officers should receive ongoing training and coaching in de-escalation, bias mitigation, and communication, backed by early-warning systems and fair discipline that distinguishes mistakes from misconduct. Communities should help set priorities and review outcomes, while non-police crisis and social-service options handle many mental-health, substance-use, and homelessness calls so enforcement focuses on serious threats. Transparent data and privacy-protecting technology should be used to measure results, reduce unnecessary contacts, and improve safety for residents and officers alike.",
