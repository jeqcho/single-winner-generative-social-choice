    "Policing should aim to keep communities safe while treating civil rights as a core measure of success, not a competing priority. A balanced approach combines clear, enforceable standards for proportional use of force and non-discriminatory practices with training, de-escalation, and community partnership to prevent harm before it happens. It also pairs targeted, evidence-based enforcement against serious violence with transparency, independent oversight, and reliable data so the public can see what works and hold agencies accountable."
