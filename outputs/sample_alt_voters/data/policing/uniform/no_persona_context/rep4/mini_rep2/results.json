Officers should be trained and supported to resolve encounters with the least intrusive, least violent options, while serious mental-health and social-service calls are routed to co-responder or civilian teams whenever feasible. Ongoing community input should shape priorities and deployment, with success measured by both safety outcomes and reductions in unnecessary enforcement and harm.",

Communities should co-design response models and performance metrics, using data to identify disparities, improve tactics, and hold agencies accountable. Cities should expand non-police and co-responder options for mental-health and social-service calls, and invest in prevention (housing, youth, treatment), while supporting officer wellness and professionalism.
