    "Policing should aim to prevent harm and build public trust by combining targeted, evidence-based safety strategies with clear protections for civil rights. That means prioritizing de-escalation, proportional responses, and transparent accountability, while also ensuring officers have the training, resources, and community partnerships needed to respond effectively to serious threats. By setting measurable goals for both crime reduction and fair, unbiased treatment\u2014and publicly reporting results\u2014communities can pursue safety and rights together rather than trading one for the other."
