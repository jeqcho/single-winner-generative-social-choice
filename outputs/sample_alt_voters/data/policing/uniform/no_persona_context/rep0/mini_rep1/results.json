Safety improves when police focus on serious violence and chronic harm while routing behavioral-health, homelessness, and substance-use crises to well-funded civilian partners whenever feasible. Public confidence requires transparent reporting, independent review of serious uses of force and misconduct, and fair, timely discipline and remedies for residents as well as due-process protections for officers. Ongoing community input and regular evaluation of outcomes should shape tactics so enforcement is effective, predictable, and respectful across all neighborhoods.",

Trust grows when misconduct is investigated quickly and independently, outcomes are reported transparently, and residents have accessible, fair complaint and remedy processes. Pairing officers with mental-health and social-service responders and using diversion where appropriate reduces unnecessary arrests and confrontations while letting police focus on serious crime. Supporting officers with adequate staffing, training, and wellness resources\u2014along with measurable performance standards\u2014helps deliver predictable, respectful, and effective public safety for everyone.",
