    "Policing should be guided by the shared goals of keeping communities safe while protecting constitutional rights, recognizing that both under-policing and over-policing can cause real harm. A balanced approach combines clear standards that prioritize de-escalation and proportional responses, strong accountability and transparency (including independent review and reliable data), and targeted enforcement focused on serious violence rather than broad low-level sweeps. Pairing these practices with community partnership and non-police supports for issues like mental health and homelessness can reduce crime and improve trust without weakening civil liberties."
