    "Effective policing should prioritize public safety while treating civil rights as a core measure of success, not a competing goal. A balanced approach combines clear, narrowly tailored enforcement standards with strong accountability\u2014transparent data, independent oversight, and proportional discipline\u2014alongside training in de-escalation and bias reduction. Investing in community partnerships and non-police crisis response for mental health and low-level conflicts can reduce unnecessary force while keeping officers focused on serious threats."
