    "Policing should be guided by the shared goals of protecting public safety and upholding civil rights, recognizing that communities expect both effective crime prevention and fair, respectful treatment. A balanced approach pairs clear limits on the use of force and strong accountability with evidence-based deployment, training, and partnerships that address root causes of harm. Building trust through transparency, consistent standards, and meaningful community input can improve cooperation and outcomes while safeguarding individual liberties."
