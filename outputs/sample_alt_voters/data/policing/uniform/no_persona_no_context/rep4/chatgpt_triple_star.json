    "Policing should prioritize public safety while treating the protection of civil rights as an essential part of effective crime prevention, not a competing goal. A balanced approach combines clear, enforceable standards for use of force and de-escalation with targeted, evidence-based deployment and strong oversight that builds public trust. Investments in training, transparent data, and independent accountability\u2014paired with partnerships that connect people to social and mental-health services\u2014can reduce harm, improve legitimacy, and help communities feel both safe and respected."
