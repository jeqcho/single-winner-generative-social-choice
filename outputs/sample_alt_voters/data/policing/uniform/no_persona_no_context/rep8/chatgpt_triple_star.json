    "Policing should be guided by the shared goals of protecting public safety and upholding civil rights, recognizing that communities may differ in how they weigh enforcement and restraint based on lived experience. A practical middle ground is to prioritize evidence-based, prevention-oriented strategies\u2014such as focused deterrence, problem-solving partnerships, and non-police crisis response where appropriate\u2014while enforcing clear limits on use of force and ensuring fair, consistent treatment. Strong accountability and transparency (training, data reporting, independent oversight, and meaningful community input) can build trust so officers can act decisively when necessary without sacrificing constitutional protections."
