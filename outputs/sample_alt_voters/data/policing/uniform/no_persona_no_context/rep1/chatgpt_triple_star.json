    "Policing should be guided by the shared goals of keeping communities safe while protecting constitutional rights and dignity, recognizing that residents may weigh these priorities differently based on lived experience. A practical middle ground is to prioritize evidence-based, prevention-focused tactics; clear limits on use of force and intrusive stops; and transparent accountability, including independent review and reliable data. Investing in training, de-escalation, and partnerships with community services can reduce harm and crime together, while regular public reporting and feedback help maintain trust and continuous improvement."
