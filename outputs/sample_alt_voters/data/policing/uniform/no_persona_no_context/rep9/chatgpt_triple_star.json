    "Policing should be guided by a dual commitment to public safety and the protection of civil rights, recognizing that communities need both effective crime prevention and fair, respectful treatment. A balanced approach pairs clear limits on the use of force and robust accountability with adequate staffing, training, and resources to respond quickly and solve serious crimes. Strategies should prioritize de-escalation, constitutional and bias-aware practices, and transparent data-driven oversight developed with community input so trust and safety improve together."
