A practical path is clear, enforceable rules for stops and use of force, strong training in de-escalation and bias awareness, and transparent, independent oversight with regular public reporting. Pair that with targeted, data-informed patrols for serious crime and alternatives to arrest for mental health and addiction calls, so resources focus on the right problems.
