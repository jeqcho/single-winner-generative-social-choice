    "Policing should be guided by a dual commitment to public safety and the protection of civil rights, recognizing that communities want both effective crime prevention and fair, accountable enforcement. A practical middle ground is to emphasize de-escalation and proportional responses, focus resources on serious harm and repeat violence, and use transparent oversight (including body-worn cameras, clear use-of-force standards, and independent review) to build trust. Pairing these approaches with community partnership and data-driven evaluation can reduce crime while minimizing unnecessary intrusions and ensuring equal treatment under the law."
