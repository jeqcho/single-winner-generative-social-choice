    "Policing strategies should prioritize public safety while safeguarding civil rights through clear, enforceable standards on the use of force, transparent accountability, and respectful, bias-aware interactions. Communities concerned about crime deserve effective prevention and rapid response, and communities concerned about over-policing deserve proportional, evidence-based tactics with strong oversight. A practical middle ground is investing in training, data-driven deployment, independent review of serious incidents, and partnerships that address root causes\u2014so trust and safety can improve together."
