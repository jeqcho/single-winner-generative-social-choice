At the same time, communities are safer when police are paired with prevention\u2014co-responder teams, treatment and housing supports, and focused deterrence on serious violence\u2014so enforcement targets the most harmful behavior without sweeping up lawful activity.",

Public trust and officer safety both improve when departments report key data, use independent oversight and fair complaint processes, and hold people accountable for misconduct while also supporting officers with training and mental-health resources.
