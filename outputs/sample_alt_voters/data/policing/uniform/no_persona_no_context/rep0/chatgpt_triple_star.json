    "Policing should be guided by a dual commitment to public safety and the protection of civil rights, recognizing that communities need both effective crime prevention and fair, lawful treatment. A balanced approach combines clear use-of-force standards, de-escalation and bias training, and targeted, evidence-based deployment with strong accountability tools such as transparent reporting, independent oversight, and meaningful consequences for misconduct. Investing in partnerships with community organizations and co-responder models for mental health and substance-use crises can reduce unnecessary confrontations while keeping officers focused on serious threats. This approach respects concerns about officer safety and rising crime while addressing fears of overreach and unequal enforcement."
