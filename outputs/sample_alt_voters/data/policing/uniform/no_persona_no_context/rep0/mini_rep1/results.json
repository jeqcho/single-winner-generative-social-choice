That means clear, consistently applied use-of-force and stop standards, strong training in de-escalation, and transparent reporting (including body-camera policies and public data) with independent review of serious incidents. Communities should have a real voice through regular forums and oversight, while officers are supported with evidence-based deployment and partnerships with mental health and social services so the right response\u2014not just arrest\u2014is available.
