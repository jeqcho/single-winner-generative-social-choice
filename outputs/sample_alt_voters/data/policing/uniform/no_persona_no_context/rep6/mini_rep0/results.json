To build trust and protect both civilians and officers, departments should invest in rigorous training, transparent reporting, and independent review of serious incidents, with measurable goals for reducing crime and unnecessary force. Communities should help set priorities, and non-police responders for mental health, addiction, and homelessness should be available so officers can focus on threats to safety while rights and dignity are upheld.",
