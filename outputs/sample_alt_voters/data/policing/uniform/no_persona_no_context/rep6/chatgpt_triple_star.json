    "Policing should prioritize public safety while treating civil rights as a core measure of success, not a competing goal. A balanced approach combines clear limits on use of force, de-escalation and bias training, and transparent accountability with data-driven deployment, problem-solving partnerships, and timely responses to serious crime. Communities should have a meaningful role in setting priorities and evaluating outcomes, so trust and legitimacy grow alongside safety."
