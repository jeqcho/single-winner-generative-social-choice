To support both safety and civil rights, departments should publish reliable data on stops, searches, force, and outcomes; enforce early-warning and discipline systems; and ensure investigations of serious incidents are independent and timely. Pairing these safeguards with well-resourced alternatives for mental health crises and low-level problems helps focus police on serious violence while reducing unnecessary encounters and building public trust.",
