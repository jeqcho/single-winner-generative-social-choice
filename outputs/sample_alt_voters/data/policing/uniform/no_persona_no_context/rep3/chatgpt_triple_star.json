    "Policing should be guided by a dual commitment to public safety and the protection of civil rights, recognizing that communities need both effective crime prevention and fair, lawful treatment. A balanced approach prioritizes de-escalation, clear use-of-force standards, and targeted, evidence-based enforcement, paired with strong accountability through transparent data, independent oversight, and meaningful community input. Investing in training, mental health and social-service partnerships, and officer wellness can reduce unnecessary encounters while maintaining the capacity to respond decisively to serious threats."
