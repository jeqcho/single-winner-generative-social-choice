Shared priorities can include clear, enforceable use-of-force and de-escalation standards, strong training and supervision, and independent, fair oversight with transparent public reporting of outcomes (crime trends, response times, complaints, and use-of-force). Partnering with residents to set local priorities and expanding co-responder or referral options for mental-health and social-service calls can keep officers focused on serious threats while lowering unnecessary confrontations. These steps support safer neighborhoods, protect civil liberties, and strengthen trust for the public and for officers doing their jobs well.",
