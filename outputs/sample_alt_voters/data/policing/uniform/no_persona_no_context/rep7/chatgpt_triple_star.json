    "Policing should aim to keep communities safe while protecting civil rights by pairing targeted, evidence-based crime prevention with clear limits on the use of force and strong due-process safeguards. This means investing in training, de-escalation, and alternatives for mental health and low-level calls, while using transparent data, independent oversight, and fair accountability to build trust. A balanced approach recognizes the need for effective response to violence and the need to prevent discriminatory or excessive policing, so policies should be evaluated publicly for both safety outcomes and equity."
