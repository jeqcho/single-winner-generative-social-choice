    "Policing should prioritize public safety while upholding constitutional rights by emphasizing de-escalation, accountability, and community partnership; officers must be trained and supported to use force only when necessary and to respect civil liberties in every interaction. Independent oversight, transparent data collection, and investments in mental health and social services can reduce reliance on enforcement alone, addressing concerns about both public safety and civil rights across communities."
