    "Policing strategies should prioritize public safety while treating civil rights and community trust as essential to effective crime prevention, not as competing goals. A balanced approach combines clear, enforceable standards on use of force, accountability and transparency, and robust training in de-escalation and bias reduction, alongside data-driven deployment that targets serious harm. It also invests in community partnerships and alternatives for nonviolent crises\u2014such as mental health response teams\u2014so police focus on the most dangerous situations while everyone\u2019s rights are protected."
