    "Policing should prioritize public safety while rigorously protecting civil rights by combining transparent, accountable practices with community partnership and targeted, evidence-based enforcement. This approach acknowledges the need for effective crime prevention and officer safety alongside reforms\u2014such as clear use-of-force standards, independent oversight, and bias-awareness training\u2014that safeguard individual liberties and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve."
