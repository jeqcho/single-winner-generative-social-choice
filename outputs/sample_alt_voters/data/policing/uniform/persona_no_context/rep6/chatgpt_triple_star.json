    "Policing should prioritize public safety while rigorously protecting civil rights by combining transparent, accountable practices with community-centered strategies; this includes clear use-of-force standards, independent oversight, de-escalation training, and data-driven deployment to reduce harm and build trust. Recognizing that communities and law enforcement bring different perspectives, agencies should partner with residents, civil-rights advocates, and mental-health professionals to jointly set priorities, review policies, and measure outcomes so that safety and liberty advance together."
