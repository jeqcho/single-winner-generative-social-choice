    "Policing should be guided by the shared goal of keeping communities safe while upholding constitutional rights, recognizing that trust and effectiveness depend on both. A balanced approach combines clear accountability and transparency with the resources and training officers need to respond effectively, including de-escalation, fair enforcement, and appropriate use-of-force standards. It should also pair targeted, data-informed policing for serious crime with strong safeguards against bias and expanded partnerships with community services so that problems better handled outside the criminal justice system are diverted when possible."
