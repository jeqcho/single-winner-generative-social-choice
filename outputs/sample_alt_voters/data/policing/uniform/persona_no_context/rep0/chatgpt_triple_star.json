    "Policing should prioritize public safety while rigorously protecting civil rights by adopting transparent, accountable practices that limit use of force, emphasize de-escalation, and ensure impartial enforcement of the law. Agencies should invest in community partnerships, training in bias awareness and crisis intervention, and independent oversight so that officers are supported in keeping communities safe and residents' freedoms and dignity are respected."
