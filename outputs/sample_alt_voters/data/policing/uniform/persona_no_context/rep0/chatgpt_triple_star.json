    "Policing should prioritize public safety while treating civil rights as a core measure of effectiveness, not a competing goal. A balanced approach combines clear constitutional standards, de-escalation and proportional use-of-force policies, and transparent accountability, alongside targeted, data-informed deployment to address serious harm. This can be strengthened through community partnership and independent oversight so residents and officers share trust, clear expectations, and safe neighborhoods."
