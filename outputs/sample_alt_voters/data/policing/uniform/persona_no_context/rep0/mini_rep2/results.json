That means clear limits on stops, searches, surveillance, and use of force; routine publication of outcomes and demographics; and independent investigation of serious incidents, alongside fair due process for both residents and officers. Day to day, departments should prioritize de-escalation and problem-solving, and route mental-health, substance-use, and homelessness calls to specialized responders whenever possible. Ongoing community input, targeted enforcement based on evidence (not stereotypes), and support for officer wellness and staffing can improve safety while strengthening legitimacy and trust.",
