    "Policing should be guided by the shared goals of keeping communities safe while protecting civil rights through transparent, accountable practices. That means prioritizing de-escalation and targeted, evidence-based deployment for serious threats, paired with clear limits on stops, searches, and use of force, and independent oversight with meaningful consequences for misconduct. Investing in training, community partnership, and alternatives for nonviolent crises can reduce harm without weakening public safety."
