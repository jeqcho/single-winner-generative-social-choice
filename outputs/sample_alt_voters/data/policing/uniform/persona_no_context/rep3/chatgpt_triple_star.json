    "Policing should prioritize public safety while equally safeguarding civil rights by adopting transparent, accountable practices that build community trust and reduce harm. This includes clear use-of-force standards, independent oversight, de-escalation training, and data-driven deployment that protects vulnerable communities, while ensuring officers have the tools and support needed to do their jobs effectively. By combining community-led engagement and measurable accountability, we can reconcile the imperative of security with the protection of liberty and dignity for all."
