    "Policing should prioritize public safety while equally upholding civil rights by combining transparent, accountable practices with community-centered policing and proportional, evidence-based use of force. By investing in de-escalation training, independent oversight, and crisis-response alternatives while maintaining clear standards for lawful enforcement, jurisdictions can protect residents, build public trust, and ensure that policing is fair, effective, and respectful of constitutional rights."
