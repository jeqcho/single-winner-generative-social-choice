Pair law enforcement with well-funded alternatives\u2014civilian crisis teams, violence interruption, and accessible treatment and housing\u2014so police can focus on serious crime while fewer encounters escalate. Transparent reporting, independent investigation of serious incidents, and fair discipline alongside support for officer wellness can rebuild trust and improve outcomes across communities.",
