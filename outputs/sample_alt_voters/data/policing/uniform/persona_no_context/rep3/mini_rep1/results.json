Communities gain trust when agencies publish auditable data on stops, searches, and force; use tools like body cameras with strong privacy safeguards; and accept independent review and fair discipline when policies are violated. Public safety is strengthened by partnering with residents and by pairing officers with mental-health and social-service responders where appropriate, while also supporting officers with adequate staffing, training, and wellness resources so they can do their jobs professionally and lawfully.",
