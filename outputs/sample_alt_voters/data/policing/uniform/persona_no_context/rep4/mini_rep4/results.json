Communities and police should jointly set priorities and measures of success, while expanding non-police responses for mental-health, substance-use, and homelessness calls so armed officers can focus on serious violence and repeat harm. This approach supports officer safety and effectiveness while making dignity, legality, and accountability nonnegotiable.",
