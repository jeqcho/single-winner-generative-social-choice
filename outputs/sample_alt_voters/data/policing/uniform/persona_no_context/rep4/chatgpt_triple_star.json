    "Policing strategies should aim to reduce harm and prevent crime while protecting civil rights through clear, enforceable standards, transparency, and accountability. Communities can support targeted, data-informed enforcement focused on serious violence, alongside de-escalation training, fair and unbiased practices, and strong oversight to address misconduct. A balanced approach also invests in non-police responses for mental health and social needs, so officers can focus on safety while residents retain trust that their rights will be respected."
