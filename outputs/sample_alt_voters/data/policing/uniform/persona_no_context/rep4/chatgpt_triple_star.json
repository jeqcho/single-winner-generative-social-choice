    "Policing should prioritize public safety while rigorously protecting civil rights by combining community-led prevention, transparent accountability, and consistent, rights-respecting enforcement practices. This balance recognizes the need for effective law enforcement to prevent harm and the equally important need for oversight, training, and community input to prevent abuse and ensure equitable treatment for all."
