Pairing officers with credible community partners and well-resourced mental-health and social-service responses for nonviolent calls can prevent escalation, improve cooperation, and keep neighborhoods safe without sacrificing civil liberties.",

Trust grows when departments publish transparent data, use body cameras with sensible privacy safeguards, and ensure independent, fair oversight and due process for both the public and officers. Communities are safer when police partner with residents, schools, and faith and civic groups, and when mental-health and addiction calls have real alternatives to arrest and jail.
