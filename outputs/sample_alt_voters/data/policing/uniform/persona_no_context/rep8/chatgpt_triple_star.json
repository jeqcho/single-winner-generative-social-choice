    "Policing strategies should aim to prevent harm and respond effectively to crime while treating civil rights and dignity as non-negotiable foundations of public safety. This means using evidence-based practices\u2014like focused deterrence, de-escalation, and community partnership\u2014paired with clear rules on use of force, strong training, and accountability systems that build trust. By investing in transparency, independent oversight, and non-police alternatives for behavioral health and minor issues, communities can improve safety outcomes without sacrificing constitutional protections."
