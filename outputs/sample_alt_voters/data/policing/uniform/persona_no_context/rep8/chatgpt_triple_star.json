    "Policing should prioritize public safety while equally protecting civil rights by adopting transparent, accountable practices that build community trust\u2014such as de-escalation training, clear use-of-force policies, independent oversight, and data-driven deployment of resources. Recognizing legitimate concerns about crime and about abuses of power, agencies should partner with community stakeholders to tailor strategies that reduce harm, ensure fairness, and allow for regular review and reform based on measurable outcomes."
