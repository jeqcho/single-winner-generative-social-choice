    "Policing should prioritize both public safety and the protection of civil rights by combining evidence-based crime prevention, transparent accountability, and community partnership; officers must be trained and supported to use force proportionately, de-escalate when possible, and respect constitutional freedoms. While acknowledging differing views on enforcement and reform, communities, police, and policymakers can agree to invest in oversight mechanisms, data-driven practices, and social services that address root causes of harm to build trust and reduce reliance on coercive policing."
