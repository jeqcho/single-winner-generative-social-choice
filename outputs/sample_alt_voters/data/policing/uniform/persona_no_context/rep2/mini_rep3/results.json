Public safety improves when officers are equipped to slow situations down\u2014through training, staffing, and wellness supports\u2014and when non-police responders handle many mental-health, substance-use, and other nonviolent crises.

Departments should prioritize de-escalation, bias and cultural-competence training, and officer wellness, while tracking measurable outcomes and enforcing meaningful accountability when standards are violated. For mental-health and other nonviolent crises, communities should expand co-responder and alternative response options and strengthen partnerships with local services.

Trust and effectiveness grow when departments use transparent reporting, body-worn cameras with privacy safeguards, and independent oversight that provides fair accountability for both misconduct and good policing.
