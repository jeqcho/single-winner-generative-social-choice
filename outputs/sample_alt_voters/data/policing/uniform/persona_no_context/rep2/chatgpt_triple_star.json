    "Policing should prioritize public safety while upholding civil rights by using evidence-based, transparent practices that minimize harm and build community trust. Policies should combine rigorous accountability, bias-aware training, and de-escalation tactics with support for non-police alternatives for mental-health and social crises, recognizing the need for both effective law enforcement and protection of individual liberties.
