    "Policing should prioritize public safety while treating civil rights as a core measure of effectiveness, not a competing goal. A balanced approach pairs targeted, evidence-based enforcement with clear limits on force, transparent accountability, and community partnership\u2014so crime is reduced without indiscriminate tactics or unequal treatment. Investing in training, data-driven oversight, and non-police crisis and social-service responses can address root causes and reduce harmful encounters, while keeping officers focused on serious threats."
