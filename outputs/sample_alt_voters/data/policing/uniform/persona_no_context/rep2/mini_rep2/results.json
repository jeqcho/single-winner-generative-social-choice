Cities should pair this with well-resourced nonpolice crisis and prevention teams, routine community feedback, and transparent reporting so residents and officers share responsibility for safer neighborhoods and equal justice.",

This requires clear, publicly available use-of-force and conduct standards; routine de-escalation, bias/cultural-competency, and crisis-intervention training; and reliable transparency tools like body-worn cameras with privacy safeguards and regular reporting. Independent oversight and investigations, plus measurable, data-driven performance audits, should ensure accountability while supporting officers who follow best practices. Cities should also expand partnerships with mental-health and social-service responders and other prevention efforts so police are not the default response to every crisis.",
