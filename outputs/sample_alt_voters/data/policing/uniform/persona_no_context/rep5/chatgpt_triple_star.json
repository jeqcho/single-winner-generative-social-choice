    "Policing should prioritize public safety while rigorously protecting civil rights by adopting community-centered practices, transparent accountability measures, and clear use-of-force standards that reflect legal and ethical norms. By investing in de-escalation training, mental health and social services partnerships, data-driven oversight, and independent review mechanisms, agencies can build trust across communities and ensure that enforcement is effective, equitable, and accountable to all citizens."
