    "Policing should be guided by a dual commitment to protect public safety and uphold civil rights, recognizing that community trust is essential to effective crime prevention. A balanced approach pairs clear standards on proportional use of force, de-escalation, and bias-free practices with targeted, evidence-based deployment to address serious violence and chronic problem areas. Strong accountability\u2014transparent reporting, independent review of critical incidents, and meaningful consequences for misconduct\u2014should be matched with training, wellness support, and resources that help officers do the job safely and lawfully. Done together with community input and measurable outcomes, these strategies can reduce harm while ensuring policing remains fair, effective, and legitimate."
