    "Policing should prioritize public safety while rigorously protecting civil rights by using evidence-based practices, transparent accountability, and community partnership; this means officers receive ongoing training in de-escalation, bias reduction, and constitutional policing, and departments implement clear oversight, data transparency, and independent review to build trust. By combining targeted enforcement of serious crime with non-punitive interventions, civilian oversight, and investments in social services, communities can reduce harm, ensure equal treatment under the law, and foster cooperation between police and the public."
