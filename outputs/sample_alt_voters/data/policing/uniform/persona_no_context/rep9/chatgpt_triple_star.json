    "Policing should prioritize protecting public safety while upholding civil rights by combining community-driven prevention, transparent accountability, and measured enforcement; this means investment in training, de-escalation, mental health and social services alongside clear use-of-force policies, independent oversight, and data-driven practices. Different stakeholders\u2014residents seeking security, advocates demanding rights protections, and officers needing support\u2014can agree on a model that emphasizes proportionality, transparency, and continuous evaluation to build trust and reduce harm."
