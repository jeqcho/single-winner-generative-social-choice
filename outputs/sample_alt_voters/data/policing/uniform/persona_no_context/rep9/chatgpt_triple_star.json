    "Policing strategies should aim to keep communities safe while firmly protecting civil rights, recognizing that public safety and constitutional liberties are mutually reinforcing rather than competing goals. A balanced approach pairs focused, evidence-based enforcement and timely emergency response with clear use-of-force limits, robust training in de-escalation and bias reduction, and transparent accountability through independent oversight and accessible data. It also invests in community partnerships and non-police alternatives for behavioral health and low-level issues, so officers can concentrate on serious threats while residents maintain trust and equal protection under the law."
