Agencies should set clear, enforceable standards for stops, searches, and use of force; train and staff for de-escalation and behavioral-health response; and publish reliable data while protecting privacy. Independent oversight, fair discipline, and accessible complaint-and-remedy processes should be paired with supports for officer wellness and effective investigation so accountability is real and performance improves. Lasting results come from sustained partnership with residents and local services to reduce violence and repeat calls, not from overbroad enforcement or militarized tactics.",
