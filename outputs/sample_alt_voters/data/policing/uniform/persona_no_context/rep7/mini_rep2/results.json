Public trust is strengthened through transparent reporting, body-camera rules that protect privacy, and independent oversight with real authority, alongside support systems that improve officer wellness and decision-making under stress.",

Pair law enforcement with well-coordinated mental-health and social-service responders so the right professionals handle crises, while officers can focus on serious threats and victim protection. Build trust with transparent data reporting, body cameras with strong privacy safeguards, and independent, fair oversight that holds misconduct accountable and recognizes good performance. Strong community partnerships and due process make safety and civil liberties reinforce each other rather than compete.",
