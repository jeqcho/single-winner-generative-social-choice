    "Policing should prioritize public safety while rigorously protecting civil rights by adopting transparent, accountable practices that reduce harm and build community trust. This means training officers in de-escalation, bias awareness, and constitutional protections, using data-driven strategies and oversight to target serious threats rather than broad enforcement, and engaging community stakeholders in policy design and review to ensure both security and dignity are upheld."
