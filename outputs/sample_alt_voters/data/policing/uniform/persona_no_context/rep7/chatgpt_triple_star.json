    "Policing should aim to keep communities safe while upholding civil rights by focusing on prevention, proportional responses, and accountability. That means using evidence-based deployment and de-escalation, prioritizing serious harm over low-level offenses, and ensuring clear rules on use of force with transparent reporting and independent oversight. At the same time, departments should invest in training, community partnerships, and co-responder models so officers aren\u2019t the default response to every social problem, balancing public order with individual dignity and equal treatment."
