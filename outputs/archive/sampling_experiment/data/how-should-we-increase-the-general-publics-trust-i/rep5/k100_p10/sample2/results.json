    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is rebuilt when people can see\u2014clearly and consistently\u2014how decisions are made, how money is spent, and how mistakes are found and fixed. Institutions should set simple, public standards for fairness and performance; publish plain-language explanations, data, and independent evaluations; and create real accountability through audits, ethics enforcement, and meaningful consequences for misconduct. At the same time, services must be accessible and respectful: clear points of contact, timely responses, multilingual communication, and community partnerships that bring residents into oversight and feedback. Leaders should communicate with humility\u2014separating facts from opinions, correcting errors promptly, and resisting partisan messaging\u2014so trust is earned through evidence, equal treatment, and steady results over time.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in democratic institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see clear evidence that rules are fair, applied consistently, and followed in practice. We should strengthen transparency with verifiable, auditable voting systems (including paper records where feasible), routine independent post-election audits such as risk-limiting audits, and strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections that safeguard both accuracy and voter privacy. Election officials should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, publish timely explanations and audit results, welcome bipartisan and nonpartisan observers, and correct mistakes openly when they occur. At the same time, we should invest in civic education and local, trusted community partnerships to reduce confusion, improve accessibility for every eligible voter (including seniors, disabled voters, and language minorities), and counter misinformation with consistent, evidence-based information\u2014so confidence is built through transparency, accountability, and equal treatment.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should make decisions easier to verify, rules easier to understand, and services easier to access\u2014no matter someone\u2019s politics, background, or ZIP code. That starts with clear, consistently applied standards; strong oversight that is independent and bipartisan where appropriate; and routine, public reporting that explains what was done, why it was done, what went wrong (if anything), and how it was fixed. Institutions should publish plain-language summaries alongside detailed technical or legal documentation, invite neutral observers and community partners (including local civic, faith, labor, and nonprofit groups), and create simple ways for residents to ask questions and receive timely, respectful answers. Trust also grows when institutions protect equal rights and accessibility (including disability and language access), safeguard privacy and security, and hold misconduct accountable\u2014while correcting misinformation with evidence rather than insults. In short: show your work, follow the same rules for everyone, measure performance publicly, and keep improving based on audits, feedback, and real-world results.",
