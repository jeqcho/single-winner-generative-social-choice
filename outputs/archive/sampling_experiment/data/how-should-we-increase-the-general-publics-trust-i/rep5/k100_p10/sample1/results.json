    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can see\u2014without needing to be experts\u2014that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and the results are verifiable. A strong middle-ground approach is to set clear minimum standards nationwide while keeping local administration: paper records for every ballot where feasible, routine post-election audits with publicly posted methods and outcomes, and transparent chain-of-custody and cybersecurity practices. Access should be protected through practical options like adequate polling locations, early and mail voting where secure, disability accommodations, and straightforward ID or identity verification that does not block eligible voters. Just as important, election officials should communicate quickly and nonpartisanly in plain language (and in the languages communities use), welcome credentialed observers from multiple parties, and invest in ongoing civic education and misinformation response so the public understands how safeguards work and why results can be trusted.",
