    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, fair treatment, and real accountability. A workable middle ground is to set transparent baseline standards nationwide while keeping local administration: maintain accurate voter rolls, offer practical identity/eligibility verification that includes accessible options, use paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records) with strong chain-of-custody, and conduct routine, independent risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language. Pair these safeguards with convenient, secure ways to vote (well-staffed polling places, reasonable early voting, and secure absentee options), plus multilingual and disability-accessible information so every eligible voter can participate without confusion or undue burden. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and calmly when problems occur\u2014showing what happened, what evidence supports the outcome, and what will be fixed\u2014so trust is earned through openness, evidence, and equal rights rather than partisan claims.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make key decisions transparent, verifiable, and easy for everyday people to understand. For elections, that means using secure, auditable systems (including paper ballots or voter-verifiable records), strict chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine independent risk-limiting audits, with results and methods published clearly and promptly. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and open to bipartisan and citizen observation, with consistent baseline rules across jurisdictions and real accountability when mistakes or misconduct occur. At the same time, institutions should protect equal access and civil rights by reducing unnecessary barriers, providing language and disability accommodations, and communicating in plain language through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, faith and community groups). When people can see the evidence, understand the process, and know concerns are handled fairly and openly, trust can be rebuilt without partisan spin.",

That means using transparent, consistently applied rules; maintaining strong security and privacy; and building in independent checks so the public doesn\u2019t have to rely on \u201ctrust us.\u201d For elections specifically, widely supported steps include paper ballots or voter-verifiable records, strict chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, strong cybersecurity, and independent oversight with meaningful access for bipartisan and nonpartisan observers. Trust also depends on equal access and respectful service: well-staffed polling places, reasonable options like early and mail voting with clear safeguards, disability accommodations, and clear information in plain language and multiple languages. Finally, institutions should publish timely, local-level explanations and audit findings, acknowledge mistakes quickly, fix them openly, and protect people from intimidation and misinformation without partisan spin. When institutions are transparent about how they work, accountable when they fail, and consistent in how they treat people, confidence can grow across political and cultural lines.",
