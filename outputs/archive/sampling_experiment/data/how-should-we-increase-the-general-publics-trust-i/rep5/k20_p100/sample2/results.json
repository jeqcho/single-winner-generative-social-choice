    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, fair treatment, and proof that systems work as promised. A practical middle ground is to combine strong access with strong verification: use voter-verifiable paper records (or equivalent auditable backups), routine risk-limiting audits, secure chain-of-custody, and independent oversight that includes bipartisan and nonpartisan observers. Pair these safeguards with consistent baseline standards, adequate funding and training for local administrators, and plain-language, multilingual communication that explains what happened, what was checked, and how any problems were fixed. By making accountability visible, correcting errors quickly, protecting privacy and voting rights, and investing in civic education and trusted community partnerships to counter misinformation, institutions can earn confidence across political and cultural differences.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decision-making easy to see, easy to verify, and consistently applied, while treating every community with equal respect. That means using voter\u2011verified paper ballots (or auditable paper records), strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody, robust cybersecurity, and routine independent risk\u2011limiting audits with results published in plain language and, where needed, multiple languages. It also means clear baseline rules that are applied the same way across jurisdictions, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight and observation, and prompt, transparent investigation and correction of errors or irregularities. At the same time, access should be practical for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and new Americans\u2014through well\u2011staffed polling places, secure early and mail voting where offered, and simple, reliable voter information. Finally, sustained civic education and community partnerships (schools, libraries, faith and local groups) can counter misinformation with facts and help people understand not just what institutions decide, but how and why those decisions can be trusted.",

It also means clear, timely, plain-language explanations of how decisions are made and results are certified\u2014shared through trusted local channels and available in multiple languages\u2014so working families, seniors, and new Americans can understand and confirm the process.\n\nFinally, institutions should earn confidence through respectful service: accessible participation (disability access, reasonable wait times, reliable registration and ballot tracking where used), nonpartisan administration with bipartisan/neutral observation, and ongoing civic education that helps people distinguish evidence from rumor. When people can see the rules, see the evidence, and see concerns addressed fairly, trust can grow across communities\u2014even when we disagree about politics.",
