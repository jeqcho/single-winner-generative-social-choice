    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see that the rules are fair, consistently applied, and open to verification. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity protections (paper records or voter-verifiable backups, secure chain-of-custody, updated voter rolls, clear standards for ID or identity verification, and routine independent risk-limiting audits) with broad, accessible ways for eligible citizens to vote (safe in-person and mail options, language assistance, and reasonable accommodations). Institutions should publish plain-language, step-by-step explanations of how votes are cast, secured, counted, audited, and recounted; welcome bipartisan and nonpartisan observers; and release timely, evidence-based updates when issues arise. Finally, sustained civic education and rapid, transparent correction of misinformation\u2014without partisan framing\u2014can help communities judge outcomes by the documented process rather than rumors or rhetoric.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should commit to rules that are clear, fair, and applied consistently, with results that ordinary people can verify. That means using auditable records (like paper ballots or voter-verified paper backups), routine independent post-election risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and transparent reporting that explains what happened and why in plain, nonpartisan language. Oversight should be genuinely bipartisan and include trained observers, while protecting voters\u2019 privacy and safety. At the same time, we should keep participation straightforward and accessible for every eligible citizen\u2014through well-run polling places, secure and trackable mail options where used, and practical help for seniors, working families, and rural communities. Reasonable safeguards such as accurate voter rolls and identity verification should be implemented in ways that prevent fraud without creating unnecessary barriers.
