    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, competently, and with accountability. A strong middle-ground approach is to pair broad, practical access to participation with verifiable integrity: voter-verified paper records (or equivalent auditable trails), routine independent post-election audits such as risk-limiting audits, and clear chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards that are applied consistently. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and transparent, with space for bipartisan observers and public reporting of audit methods, findings, and corrective actions. At the same time, officials should communicate in plain language, publish timely data and explanations, quickly correct mistakes, and work with trusted local partners (schools, libraries, civic and faith groups) to expand civics education and counter misinformation\u2014so every community can understand how outcomes are checked and why they are credible.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and independently verify that rules are fair and results are accurate, while every eligible person can participate without unnecessary barriers. We should set clear, consistently applied baseline standards for election administration: secure chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and voter-verified paper ballots (or auditable paper records) backed by routine, independent risk-limiting audits with publicly posted methods and results. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and transparent, welcoming bipartisan observers and promptly reporting problems and corrective actions.\n\nAt the same time, trust requires respectful service and access: well-staffed polling places, reasonable early and mail voting options with ballot tracking where feasible, disability and language accommodations, and plain-language, multilingual explanations of how registration, voting, counting, and audits work. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education and rapid, fact-based communication\u2014working with trusted local partners like libraries, schools, and community organizations\u2014to reduce confusion, counter misinformation, and demonstrate accountability over time.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared, practical commitments: make decisions transparent, results verifiable, rules consistent, and service respectful to every community.\n\nThat means institutions should:\n- Use processes people can verify: voter-verified paper ballots (or auditable paper records), routine independent risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody, and robust cybersecurity, with audit methods and results published in plain language.\n- Provide accountable, nonpartisan oversight: clear roles for bipartisan and independent observers, open reporting of problems and fixes, and real consequences for fraud, interference, or official misconduct.\n- Keep access fair and workable: well-funded local offices, shorter lines, accessible polling places, disability accommodations, and clear options for early and mail voting with secure ballot tracking.\n- Balance security and inclusion: sensible identity and registration protections that deter fraud while ensuring eligible voters\u2014including working families, rural residents, seniors, language minorities, and new Americans\u2014can vote without undue burden.\n- Communicate consistently and locally: multilingual, plain-language explanations delivered through trusted community partners (schools, libraries, faith groups, and local media), rapid corrections when mistakes occur, and a commitment to listen respectfully to concerns.\n\nIf institutions consistently show their work, admit and fix errors, protect both integrity and access, and treat people with dignity, trust can grow across political lines because citizens can see that outcomes are fair\u2014even when their side loses.",
