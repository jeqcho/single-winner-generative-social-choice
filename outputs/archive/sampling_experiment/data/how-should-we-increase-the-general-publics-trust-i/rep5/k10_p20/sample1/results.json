    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, can verify outcomes, and experience fair treatment in practice\u2014not just in promises. A strong middle-ground approach is to set clear, consistent rules; publish plain-language explanations of processes, budgets, and performance; and expand independent oversight that is transparent, nonpartisan, and empowered to investigate problems and report findings publicly. Institutions should back claims with evidence, protect privacy and security, correct mistakes quickly, and make data accessible without requiring technical expertise. Just as important, they should remove practical barriers to participation and service\u2014through language access, disability accommodations, reasonable wait times, and respectful customer service\u2014while partnering with trusted local groups to share accurate information and counter misinformation. When accountability is real, communication is understandable, and access is equitable, trust can be rebuilt across political and cultural divides.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy to verify, easy to understand, and fair in practice. That means clear, consistently applied rules; transparent, well-documented procedures; strong security and privacy protections; and routine, independent oversight with auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails) and risk-limiting audits that are published promptly. Institutions should communicate in plain, nonpartisan language, release timely data and explanations when questions arise, and correct mistakes openly to reduce misinformation. Just as important, they must be accessible to all eligible participants through practical options that respect people\u2019s time and needs, and they should be adequately funded and professionally run at the local level so the public can see competence and accountability in action.",

Trust also grows when institutions are accessible and respectful: straightforward rules applied equally, reliable funding and staffing for frontline offices, convenient options for working families and seniors, and language/disability accommodations so everyone can participate confidently. Finally, institutions should partner with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, community groups, veterans and faith organizations\u2014to share fact-checked information, reduce misinformation, and demonstrate that performance, integrity, and service to the public\u2014not partisan advantage\u2014drive the process.",
