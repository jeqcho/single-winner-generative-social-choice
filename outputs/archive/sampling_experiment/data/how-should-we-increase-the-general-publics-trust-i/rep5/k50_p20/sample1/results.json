    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014improves when people can see that the rules are fair, the process is verifiable, and concerns are addressed openly rather than dismissed. A strong middle-ground approach is to combine broad access for eligible voters with strong safeguards: accurate voter registration and regularly maintained rolls; secure chain-of-custody for ballots; voter-verified paper records (or equally auditable records where paper is not feasible); routine, independent post-election audits with publicly posted methods and results; and clear, consistent standards applied across jurisdictions. Transparency should include meaningful public observation and timely, plain-language explanations of what happened and why, including prompt correction of mistakes. Finally, institutions should invest in nonpartisan civic education and multilingual communication, partner with trusted local organizations, and respond quickly to misinformation with evidence\u2014so people of different political views can evaluate the same facts and feel confident that every eligible vote is counted and protected.",

We should strengthen transparency and accountability with voter\u2011verified paper ballots (or equally auditable records), routine post\u2011election risk\u2011limiting audits, strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity, and public reporting that explains methods and results in plain language down to the local level. Oversight should be meaningfully bipartisan/nonpartisan, with open observation and clear, consistently applied procedures across jurisdictions. At the same time, we should protect access and equal rights through secure, accurate voter rolls, reliable registration systems, language and disability accommodations, well\u2011staffed polling places, and voting options that preserve both integrity and privacy. Finally, sustained civics education and rapid, evidence\u2011based responses to misinformation\u2014delivered through trusted local institutions like schools, libraries, and community organizations\u2014can help people judge the process by facts rather than rumors and rebuild durable confidence.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, apply them consistently, and let people verify outcomes for themselves. That means maintaining secure systems with strong chain-of-custody, voter-verified paper ballots (or equally auditable records), routine independent risk-limiting audits, and public reporting that explains results and audit findings in plain language. Access and fairness must be protected at the same time: reliable voter registration, reasonable identity verification where used, safe and convenient options to vote, and full disability and language access so every eligible voter can participate without barriers. Because misinformation and secrecy erode confidence, institutions should communicate early and often through trusted local channels (schools, libraries, community and faith organizations), publish data and procedures openly, correct errors quickly, and welcome bipartisan and nonpartisan observers. When people can see how decisions are made, how money is spent, and how accountability works\u2014through transparent processes, independent oversight, and respectful public service\u2014trust becomes something institutions earn and communities can confirm.",
