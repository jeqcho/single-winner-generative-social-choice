    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see that rules are clear, applied consistently, and checked by more than one set of eyes. We should pair secure, voter-verifiable systems (like a reliable paper record or equivalent audit trail), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and routine independent audits with open reporting that explains what happened, what went wrong (if anything), and how issues were fixed. Oversight should be nonpartisan and publicly observable, with transparent data and opportunities for community members, parties, and watchdogs to review processes without undermining voter privacy. At the same time, institutions must earn trust by serving everyone fairly\u2014through accessible voting options, plain-language and multilingual information, responsive customer-service style support, and sustained civic education that helps people evaluate claims and resist misinformation. Trust is built over time through competence, accountability, and respectful treatment, not through rhetoric.",

Trust also grows when participation is genuinely accessible: straightforward registration, secure in\u2011person and mail options, and polling places that are convenient and accommodating for people with disabilities and different language needs. Finally, institutions must communicate plainly and proactively\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted community partners\u2014explaining how decisions are made, sharing accurate data, and quickly correcting misinformation and mistakes. Transparent oversight, verifiable safeguards, and clear public education together make it easier for people of all viewpoints to accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",

That means clear, consistent rules applied equally; secure systems with a trustworthy paper trail or other voter-verifiable records; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine, independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with findings reported promptly and plainly. Oversight should be nonpartisan and transparent, welcoming observers and publishing accessible data while protecting privacy. Trust also grows when institutions communicate early and honestly about problems and fixes, and when communities get practical civic education and multilingual, plain-language information through schools, libraries, faith groups, and local organizations.
