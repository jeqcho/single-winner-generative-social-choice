    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and credible checks that work no matter who wins. We should set transparent baseline standards for registration, voting, and counting; use systems that produce a voter-verifiable record with routine, publicly reported audits; and maintain strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections. Oversight should be independent and visibly nonpartisan, with trained observers and open data that allow journalists, researchers, and ordinary citizens to verify key steps without compromising ballot privacy. Just as important, institutions must communicate in plain language, in multiple languages, through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, faith and community groups), respond quickly to problems, and show real accountability\u2014including correcting errors and enforcing penalties for interference or intimidation. When safeguards are understandable, consistently applied, and paired with genuine accessibility for eligible voters, trust becomes something the public can verify rather than simply be asked to grant.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on things people can verify for themselves: clear rules, consistent standards, and transparent results. That means using voter-verifiable paper ballots (or equivalent auditable records), routine risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and independent, nonpartisan oversight with bipartisan and community observers so no single party controls the process. Trust also grows when participation is practical and fair: adequately staffed polling places, safe and accessible early voting and secure vote-by-mail options, and protections against intimidation\u2014while preserving ballot privacy. Finally, institutions must communicate in plain language, on time, and in the languages people use at home\u2014through trusted local partners like schools, libraries, community groups, and faith organizations\u2014so residents understand how decisions are made, how problems are handled, and how misinformation is corrected. When accountability is visible, access is real, and communication is honest and inclusive, confidence in our institutions can rise across communities.",
