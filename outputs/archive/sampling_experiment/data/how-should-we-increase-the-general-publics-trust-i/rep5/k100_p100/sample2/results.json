    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and verify how decisions are made, and when rules are applied fairly to everyone. A durable middle ground is to pair broad access with strong, neutral safeguards: voter-verified records (such as paper ballots or equivalent auditable backups), secure chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine independent audits with publicly posted methods and results, and clear processes for investigating and correcting problems. Institutions should communicate early and often in plain, multilingual language, release non-sensitive data that allows public oversight while protecting privacy, and welcome bipartisan and nonpartisan observers. Finally, consistent baseline standards, adequate funding for frontline administrators, and sustained civic education and local partnerships (schools, libraries, faith and community groups) can reduce confusion, counter misinformation, and rebuild confidence that institutions serve the public rather than any party or faction.",

That means using voter-verified paper ballots (or an equivalent auditable record), strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine independent risk-limiting audits with results published promptly in plain language and at a usable local level. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan, with transparent observation procedures open to bipartisan and qualified citizen observers. At the same time, access must remain practical and fair for all eligible voters\u2014safe polling places, reasonable wait times, disability and language accommodations, and secure options like early voting and well-verified mail voting. Where measures like voter ID or voter-roll maintenance are used, they should be implemented uniformly and paired with free, accessible ways to comply so they protect integrity without disenfranchising lawful voters. Finally, institutions should invest in straightforward civic education and rapid, fact-based corrections to misinformation, so the public can see the evidence behind decisions and accept results even when their preferred side loses.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should make government decision-making easier to verify, easier to understand, and fair in how it treats people\u2014without favoring any party or group. That starts with transparent, consistent rules; clear, plain-language explanations of what officials are doing and why; and independent oversight that regularly audits performance and publicly reports findings, mistakes, and fixes. Institutions should strengthen basic integrity safeguards (strong cybersecurity and data protection, clear records and chain-of-custody where relevant, and meaningful consequences for corruption or abuse), while also protecting equal access to services\u2014so working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and multilingual communities can participate without unnecessary barriers. Finally, we should invest in civic education and trusted local messengers (schools, libraries, community and faith organizations) to counter misinformation with facts, and create simple ways for residents to ask questions, see evidence, and get timely responses. Trust grows when institutions are competent, accountable, and visibly serving everyone under the same rules.",
