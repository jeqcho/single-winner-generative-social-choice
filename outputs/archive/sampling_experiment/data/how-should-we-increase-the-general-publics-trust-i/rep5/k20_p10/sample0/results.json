    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can both participate easily and see clear, credible proof that rules are fair and consistently applied. A workable middle ground is to pair broad access (adequate polling locations and hours, early voting, and secure options for mail or absentee voting with ballot tracking) with strong verification (voter-verified records, rigorous chain-of-custody, and routine independent audits that are publicly reported in plain language). Institutions should also communicate early and often\u2014explaining what safeguards exist, how problems are detected and fixed, and how complaints are handled\u2014while partnering with local community leaders and nonpartisan experts to counter misinformation without censoring legitimate questions. When procedures are transparent, oversight is genuinely bipartisan or nonpartisan, and accountability is visible, people across political and demographic lines have more reason to believe outcomes are accurate and their voices matter.",

That means using voter-verifiable paper ballots (or equivalent records), strict chain-of-custody, robust cybersecurity, and routine independent, bipartisan risk-limiting audits with timely public reporting of results and any discrepancies. At the same time, we should make participation practical for working families and underserved communities through reliable polling places, early voting, secure mail voting with ballot tracking, and accessibility for people with disabilities\u2014implemented under transparent, uniform core standards. Finally, institutions should communicate in plain language, publish data and decisions openly, and invest in nonpartisan civic education and community outreach to counter misinformation and show, step by step, how integrity and equal treatment are protected.",

That means using verifiable records (like voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine independent, bipartisan audits (including risk-limiting audits) with timely public reporting of findings and how issues are resolved. Trust also depends on access and respect: convenient options such as early voting, well-run polling places, and secure mail voting with ballot tracking where offered; disability access; and clear, plain-language information in multiple languages through trusted local messengers. Finally, institutions should be accountable in everyday ways\u2014publishing performance metrics, responding quickly to concerns, protecting privacy, and enforcing consistent rules across communities\u2014so people can see that the system is both fair and reliable.",
