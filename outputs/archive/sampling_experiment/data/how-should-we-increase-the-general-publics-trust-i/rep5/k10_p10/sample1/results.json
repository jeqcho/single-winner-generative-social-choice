    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and evidence that decisions are made fairly, securely, and without partisan favoritism. A practical middle ground is to set transparent baseline standards (with room for local implementation), rely on verifiable systems like paper records and routine independent audits, and publish timely, plain-language explanations of results, errors, and fixes. Trust also depends on access and dignity: information should be multilingual and disability-accessible, voting and public services should be straightforward to use, and community partners (schools, libraries, local nonprofits, faith groups) should help answer questions and counter misinformation without shaming people for skepticism. Finally, accountability must be real\u2014clear ethics rules, open data where possible, strong privacy protections, and consequences for wrongdoing\u2014so confidence is earned through consistent, observable practice rather than appeals to authority.",

Clear, consistent rules\u2014paired with plain\u2011language, multilingual voter information and community outreach\u2014should explain how ballots are cast, protected, counted, and reported, and how issues are corrected.

That means using transparent, consistent procedures; keeping auditable records (like paper ballots or equivalent records); running routine, independent post-process audits; and publicly explaining what was found in plain language. Trust also grows when access is practical for real life: accurate information in multiple languages, simple step-by-step explanations, accessible locations and hours, and help from trusted local partners like schools, libraries, and community organizations. Institutions should be nonpartisan in administration, protect privacy and security, respond quickly when mistakes happen, and enforce consequences for fraud or misconduct\u2014so people don\u2019t have to \u201cjust trust,\u201d they can see the evidence that the system is fair, inclusive, and accountable.",
