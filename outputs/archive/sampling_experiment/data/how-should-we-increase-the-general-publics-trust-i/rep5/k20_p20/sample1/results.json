    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can clearly see that the rules are fair, the work is done competently, and problems are acknowledged and fixed. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, verifiable safeguards (paper records where feasible, secure chain-of-custody, routine independent audits, and protections against cyber threats) with broad, consistent access for eligible voters (well-run polling places, reliable registration, and secure options like early or mail voting with tracking where offered). Institutions should publish plain-language, multilingual explanations of procedures and audit results, invite bipartisan and nonpartisan observers under clear standards, and communicate quickly and factually when mistakes occur. Investing in local administration, customer-service training, and ongoing civic education through trusted community partners can reduce confusion, counter misinformation, and show that the system works the same way for everyone.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on three shared expectations: integrity, transparency, and fair access. That means using secure, auditable systems (including paper records where feasible), routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits), strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections, and public reporting that is timely, plain-language, and available in the languages people use at home. It also means adequately funding and training local officials, welcoming bipartisan and nonpartisan observers, and setting clear, consistent rules that are applied the same way to everyone while protecting voter privacy and lawful participation. Finally, institutions should partner with trusted community organizations\u2014schools, libraries, faith groups, and local civic leaders\u2014to explain how decisions are made, correct misinformation with evidence, and invite ongoing feedback. When people can see how the process works, verify results, and experience respectful service, trust becomes something institutions earn and maintain.",
