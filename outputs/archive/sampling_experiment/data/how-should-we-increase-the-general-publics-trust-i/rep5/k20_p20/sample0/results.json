    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, verify, and understand how decisions are made, and when rules are applied fairly to everyone. A practical middle ground is to combine strong integrity measures (voter\u2011verified paper records, secure chain\u2011of\u2011custody, routine independent audits, and modern cybersecurity) with broad access (reliable registration, well-run polling places, safe options for mail and in-person voting, and accommodations for language and disability needs). Institutions should communicate in plain language, publish timely audit and performance data, and invite bipartisan and community observation so oversight doesn\u2019t depend on trust alone. Finally, sustained civic education and partnerships with trusted local leaders can reduce misinformation and make accountability feel real\u2014not partisan\u2014so more people accept outcomes even when their side loses.",
