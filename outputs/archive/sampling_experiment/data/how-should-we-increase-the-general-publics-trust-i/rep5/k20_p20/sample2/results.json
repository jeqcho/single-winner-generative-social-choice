    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and participation is genuinely accessible. A workable middle ground is transparent, nonpartisan administration with voter-verifiable records (paper ballots or equivalent), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine independent audits whose methods and results are published in plain language. Access should be strengthened through convenient options (early voting, well-run in-person locations, and secure absentee/mail for those who need it), plus practical safeguards like reasonable identity verification paired with free, easy ways to obtain ID so no eligible voter is blocked. Institutions should communicate consistently and humbly\u2014explaining how decisions are made, correcting errors quickly, enforcing rules evenly, and partnering with trusted local groups and schools to expand civic education and counter misinformation\u2014so people across backgrounds feel respected, informed, and confident the system works for everyone.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the process clearly fair, secure, and easy for ordinary people to verify. That means nonpartisan, professional administration; voter-verifiable paper ballots (or equally auditable records); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine, independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results reported publicly in plain language. Trust also grows when participation is genuinely accessible: well-staffed and conveniently located polling places, early and mail voting with clear safeguards, disability and language access, and consistent rules that are communicated ahead of time. Finally, institutions should invest in year-round civic education and community-based outreach to counter misinformation, explain how decisions are made, and show\u2014through transparent accountability\u2014that rules are enforced and every eligible person\u2019s voice is counted and protected.",

If institutions consistently show their work, invite scrutiny, protect rights and privacy, and correct mistakes openly, trust can be rebuilt over time.",
