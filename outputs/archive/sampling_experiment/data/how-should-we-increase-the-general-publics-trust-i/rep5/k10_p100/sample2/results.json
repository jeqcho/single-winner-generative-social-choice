    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see that rules are fair, consistently applied, and enforced without favoritism. We should set clear baseline standards that protect both access and integrity: secure, auditable ballots (including a voter-verifiable paper record), routine independent post-election audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and real consequences for fraud, intimidation, or partisan interference. Just as important, institutions should communicate like public servants: publish plain-language explanations and timely data about procedures, problems, and fixes; invite bipartisan and nonpartisan observers; and invest in ongoing civic education and community partnerships so information reaches people in the languages and formats they use. When institutions are transparent, accountable, and respectful\u2014especially when mistakes happen\u2014more Americans can accept outcomes and re-engage with confidence.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on processes people can verify, rules applied consistently, and communication that is clear and nonpartisan. That means using voter-verifiable paper ballots (or auditable records), routine independent risk-limiting audits, strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and transparent public reporting of results, audit findings, and how any issues are investigated and corrected. Oversight should be genuinely bipartisan and open to neutral observers, with accountable local officials supported by consistent baseline standards. At the same time, voting must remain accessible for all eligible citizens through well-run polling places and secure options like early voting and mail voting with reliable tracking, plus language and disability accommodations. Finally, sustained civic education and plain-language outreach through trusted community partners (schools, libraries, and local organizations) can counter misinformation and help people understand why the system is fair, secure, and worthy of confidence.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared, practical commitments: make decisions and results verifiable, apply rules consistently, treat the public with respect, and communicate clearly.\n\nFirst, institutions should use transparent, independently checkable processes: voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent auditable records, strong chain-of-custody, robust cybersecurity, and routine risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language. Where identification or voter-roll maintenance is used, it should be implemented fairly and paired with simple, accessible ways for eligible citizens to vote so security never becomes a barrier.\n\nSecond, accountability must be visible: independent, nonpartisan oversight; bipartisan observation where appropriate; prompt investigation of problems; and clear reporting on what happened and how it was fixed.\n\nFinally, trust grows when people understand the system. Invest in civics education and community outreach through schools, libraries, workplaces, and trusted local organizations, with multilingual materials and accessible formats, so every community can see how institutions work\u2014and how they earn legitimacy through evidence, consistency, and service.",
