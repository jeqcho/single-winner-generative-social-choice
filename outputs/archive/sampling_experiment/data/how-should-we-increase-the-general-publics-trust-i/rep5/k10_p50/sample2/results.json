    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014is earned when people can see clear rules, fair treatment, and real accountability. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, uniformly applied safeguards (secure voter registration, well-maintained voter rolls, verifiable paper records or auditable equivalents, strict chain-of-custody, and routine independent audits) with broad, convenient access for eligible voters (multiple safe ways to vote, disability and language accommodations, and reasonable wait times). Officials should communicate results and any problems quickly in plain language, publish audit methods and findings, welcome bipartisan and nonpartisan observers, and enforce penalties for fraud or interference while protecting voter privacy. When the process is both secure and straightforward\u2014and explanations are transparent enough for ordinary people to evaluate\u2014confidence can grow across political lines.",

For elections, that means using auditable paper ballots (or voter-verified paper records), routine independent risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and clear, timely public reporting of results, irregularities, and corrective actions in plain language. It also means practical safeguards that many people expect\u2014accurate voter rolls, reasonable identity/eligibility checks that do not block lawful voters, and real consequences for fraud or interference\u2014paired with broad, convenient access such as early voting, secure mail voting with ballot tracking, disability and language accommodations, and well-run polling places. Finally, institutions should invite bipartisan and nonpartisan observers, publish understandable process dashboards and data where appropriate, and invest in civic education and trusted community partnerships (schools, libraries, faith and local groups) so people can see how the system works, ask questions, and judge evidence over rumor.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should make decisions and outcomes easier to verify, easier to understand, and fair in practice\u2014not just in principle. That means setting clear, consistent rules; publishing plain-language explanations of how decisions are made; and sharing transparent data about performance, mistakes, and fixes. Institutions should use independent oversight and routine audits, welcome appropriate public observation, and enforce real accountability when rules are broken, while protecting privacy and civil rights.\n\nTrust also grows when services are accessible and respectful for everyone: convenient hours, language access (including Spanish and other commonly used languages), disability accommodations, and simple ways for working families and seniors to get help. Finally, institutions should partner with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, faith and community groups\u2014and invest in ongoing civic education so people can judge evidence over rumors and feel heard, not managed.",
