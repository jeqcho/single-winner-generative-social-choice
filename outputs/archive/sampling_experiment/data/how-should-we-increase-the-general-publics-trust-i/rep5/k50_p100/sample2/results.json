    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see that rules are fair, consistent, and followed the same way for everyone, and when problems are found and fixed in the open. A practical middle ground is to pair strong access with strong verification: maintain convenient options to vote (in person, early, and secure mail where available) while using voter-verified paper records or equivalent audit trails, clear chain-of-custody, regularly maintained voter rolls, and routine independent audits whose methods and results are published in plain language. Institutions should communicate early and often with timely, factual updates; make data and decisions easy to inspect without compromising privacy; welcome bipartisan and nonpartisan observers; and enforce consequences for fraud, intimidation, and interference. Finally, sustained civics education and partnerships with trusted local groups can help counter misinformation and ensure every community understands how the system works and how accountability is measured.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easier for everyday people to verify, not just accept. That means transparent, consistently applied rules; voter\u2011verified paper ballots (or an equivalent auditable record); strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody; routine, independent risk\u2011limiting audits; strong cybersecurity; and timely, plain\u2011language public reporting of procedures, audit findings, and how problems are corrected. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and bipartisan, with trained observers and clear accountability for misconduct or interference. At the same time, institutions should protect civil rights and ensure broad, practical access\u2014safe polling places, reasonable accommodations for disability and language needs, and trustworthy voter education through schools and local community partners\u2014so integrity and inclusion reinforce each other and people can trust outcomes whether their side wins or loses.",

That means transparent, consistently applied rules; secure systems with a voter-verifiable paper trail (or equivalent auditable record); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results published in plain language; and real accountability when mistakes or misconduct occur. Trust also grows when participation is straightforward and fair: accessible polling places, reasonable options like early and mail voting with secure verification and ballot tracking where used, accommodations for disabilities, and clear information in multiple languages. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education and community partnerships\u2014schools, libraries, faith and local groups\u2014so people hear reliable information from trusted messengers and concerns are answered quickly and nonpartisanly. This combination of verifiable safeguards, equal access, and transparent communication helps people accept outcomes and strengthens confidence in the institutions that serve us all.",
