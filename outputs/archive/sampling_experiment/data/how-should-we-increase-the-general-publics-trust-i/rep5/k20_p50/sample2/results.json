    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and experience respectful service in their daily lives. We should expand transparency through plain-language explanations, open data where privacy allows, clear ethics rules, and independent audits or oversight that are genuinely nonpartisan. Institutions should set consistent, evidence-based standards, publish performance metrics, admit and correct mistakes quickly, and protect both security and individual rights. Just as important, they should invest in civic education and two-way community engagement\u2014listening sessions, multilingual outreach, and partnerships with trusted local organizations\u2014so people across political viewpoints and backgrounds feel informed, heard, and confident that the system works for everyone.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on steps that are transparent, verifiable, and fair to people across the political spectrum. That means using voting and record-keeping systems that produce an auditable paper trail (or equivalent voter-verifiable record), conducting routine independent risk-limiting audits, and enforcing clear chain-of-custody and security practices that protect ballot secrecy and privacy. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and include bipartisan observers, with consistent baseline standards so the rules are applied the same way from place to place.\n\nTrust also depends on access and understanding. Institutions should make it easy for every eligible person to participate through secure, accessible options (including accommodations for disabilities, language access, and convenient voting methods where appropriate), while maintaining reasonable identity and eligibility checks that don\u2019t create unnecessary barriers. Finally, officials must communicate in plain language\u2014quickly, openly, and with evidence\u2014about how decisions are made, how results are verified, and how mistakes or irregularities are investigated and corrected. When people can see the safeguards, understand the process, and watch accountability in action, confidence grows even when outcomes disappoint.",

That means clear, consistent rules; transparent decision-making; and strong accountability when mistakes happen.\n\nFirst, institutions should make key processes verifiable and auditable: voter-verified paper ballots (or equally auditable records), routine post-election risk-limiting audits, secure chain-of-custody procedures, strong cybersecurity, and public reporting that explains what was checked and what was found. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan, with bipartisan observers and independent experts able to review results.\n\nSecond, institutions should be accessible and fair in practice: convenient voting options (such as early voting and secure absentee or mail options where used), polling places that work for people with disabilities and working schedules, and clear standards for voter ID or identity verification that protect integrity without blocking eligible voters.\n\nThird, institutions must communicate plainly and proactively: timely, plain-language explanations of rules, safeguards, and results; multilingual materials where needed; rapid correction of misinformation with evidence; and regular public engagement through trusted local partners like schools, libraries, faith communities, and civic groups.\n\nWhen institutions combine verifiable safeguards, equal treatment, and respectful, transparent communication, people are more likely to accept outcomes\u2014even when their side loses\u2014and confidence in our shared democratic system grows.",
