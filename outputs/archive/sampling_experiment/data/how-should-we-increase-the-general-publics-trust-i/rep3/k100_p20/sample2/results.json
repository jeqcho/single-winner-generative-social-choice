We should commit to verifiable voting with paper records, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent audits whose methods and results are explained in plain language. At the same time, we should make participation practical and accessible through well-run polling places, reasonable early and mail options where allowed, disability-friendly design, and accurate multilingual information. Transparency should be real and observable: clear public reporting, opportunities for bipartisan and nonpartisan observers under consistent rules, and protections for frontline staff so administration is professional rather than partisan. Finally, institutions should earn trust year-round by correcting mistakes openly, sharing data responsibly, and working with trusted local partners\u2014schools, libraries, and community and faith organizations\u2014to strengthen civic understanding and reduce misinformation.",

We should use paper-based ballots or voter-verifiable paper records everywhere, maintain clear chain-of-custody procedures, and conduct routine, independent post-election risk-limiting audits with results explained in plain language.

Access must be practical and equal: convenient voting options, disability-friendly design, and accurate multilingual information so every eligible voter can participate without confusion.
