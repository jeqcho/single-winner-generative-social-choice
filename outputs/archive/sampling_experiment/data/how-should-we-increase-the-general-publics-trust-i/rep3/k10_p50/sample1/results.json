    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the rules are clear, the results are independently verifiable, and voting is practical for everyday people. A strong middle-ground approach is to pair broad access (well-staffed polling places, reasonable early and mail voting with tracking, disability accommodations, and legally required language support) with strong safeguards (paper records or voter-verifiable backups, strict chain-of-custody, robust cybersecurity, and routine post-election risk-limiting audits with publicly posted results). Election offices should communicate in plain, nonpartisan language\u2014before, during, and after Election Day\u2014explaining how ballots are protected, what checks are performed, and how problems are handled, while allowing bipartisan observers and neutral monitors to watch without disrupting workers or voters. Finally, long-term trust requires sustained civic education and partnerships with trusted local institutions (schools, libraries, faith and community groups) so people can distinguish verified information from rumors and feel confident participating even when their preferred candidates lose.",

We should standardize clear, plain-language procedures; use auditable records (like paper ballots or voter-verifiable trails), strict chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine independent post-election audits with publicly posted findings.
