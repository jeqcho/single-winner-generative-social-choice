Institutions should publish plain-language explanations of how decisions are made, disclose key data and conflicts of interest, and invite regular public observation and third-party audits\u2014while protecting privacy and security. Access also matters: services and information should be easy to use, available in multiple languages and formats, and responsive to people\u2019s real-life constraints. Finally, leaders should model integrity by correcting errors publicly, enforcing consequences for misconduct, and communicating consistently and calmly so accountability\u2014not politics\u2014drives confidence.",

For elections in particular, that means using voter-verifiable paper ballots (or an auditable paper record), strict chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine, publicly reported, nonpartisan post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) so outcomes can be checked without partisan spin. At the same time, the system must remain accessible to every eligible voter through well\u2011funded polling places, early and mail options where available, disability accommodations, and clear multilingual, plain\u2011language information about how ballots are cast, counted, and audited. Finally, sustained civics and media\u2011literacy education\u2014delivered through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations\u2014can reduce misinformation and help communities understand the safeguards, making it easier for people to accept verified results even when their preferred side loses.",
