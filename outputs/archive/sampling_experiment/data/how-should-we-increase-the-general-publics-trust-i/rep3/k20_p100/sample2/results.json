    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability, not just promises. We should combine broad access for every eligible voter with safeguards that are easy to explain and independently check: a voter-verifiable paper record, strong chain-of-custody, routine post-election audits with publicly posted plain-language results, and secure, well-tested technology. Oversight should be nonpartisan and transparent, with space for bipartisan observers and qualified independent experts while protecting voter privacy and the safety of election workers. Institutions should also communicate early and often\u2014quickly acknowledging problems, correcting misinformation with evidence, and partnering with trusted local groups (schools, libraries, faith and civic organizations) to provide multilingual, accessible education about how the system works. When institutions are predictable, open to scrutiny, and responsive to community concerns, people are more likely to accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",

Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and locally visible\u2014through independent inspectors general, bipartisan or cross-community review panels, and protected whistleblowers\u2014so people know concerns will be heard without retaliation.\n\nAt the same time, trust requires equal, practical access: services and information should be available in multiple languages, designed for people with disabilities, and delivered through convenient channels and hours that fit working families. Institutions should communicate quickly and honestly about mistakes, security incidents, and how problems are fixed, while actively countering misinformation with evidence and open records rather than slogans. When institutions are transparent, audited, accessible, and responsive\u2014without partisan spin\u2014more people will accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and independently verify that rules are fair, consistently applied, and followed the same way for everyone. A strong baseline is simple, auditable procedures: voter\u2011verifiable paper records (or equivalent), clear chain\u2011of\u2011custody, routine independent post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits), and public reporting of results, audit findings, and any problems and fixes in plain language. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and local enough for accountability, while meeting common security standards nationwide, including strong cybersecurity and protections for election workers.\n\nTrust also requires equal, practical access: well\u2011staffed polling places, reasonable wait times, accessible options for seniors and people with disabilities, and clear multilingual information so every eligible voter can participate without confusion or intimidation. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic and media literacy\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted community organizations\u2014so people can separate facts from rumors and evaluate evidence calmly. When institutions operate transparently, correct mistakes openly, and treat every community with respect, more Americans will accept outcomes even when their preferred side loses.",
