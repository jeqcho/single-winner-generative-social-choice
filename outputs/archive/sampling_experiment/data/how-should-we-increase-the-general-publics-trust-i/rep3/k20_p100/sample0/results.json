    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, based on evidence, and with real accountability\u2014not partisan advantage or insider relationships. That means setting clear, consistent rules; publishing understandable data about performance and spending; and using independent audits, inspectors general, and citizen oversight panels that can verify claims and investigate problems. Institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual language, admit mistakes quickly, explain how they will fix them, and report back on results. At the same time, services must remain accessible\u2014reducing red tape, protecting privacy, and ensuring everyone can participate and receive help without discrimination. When institutions are transparent about how they work, open to scrutiny, and responsive to community feedback, trust can be rebuilt across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and verify that the rules are followed fairly for everyone. A strong foundation is transparent, locally accountable administration with consistent standards, secure paper ballots (or voter\u2011verifiable paper records), strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody, and routine post\u2011election risk\u2011limiting audits whose methods and results are published in plain language. Institutions should welcome bipartisan and independent observation, communicate promptly and factually about problems and fixes, and invest in cybersecurity and worker safety without making participation harder for eligible voters. At the same time, trust increases when access is practical and inclusive: well-funded polling places, reasonable options like early and mail voting where used, and clear multilingual and disability-friendly information. Finally, long-term trust depends on civic education and community outreach\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations\u2014so people can separate facts from rumors and feel confident that outcomes reflect the public\u2019s will.",

We should set simple, consistent rules; publish plain-language explanations and timely, accessible data; and require independent audits and oversight that are open to public observation while protecting privacy and safety. Institutions also need strong protections against corruption and cyber threats, clear channels for complaints and appeals, and real consequences when standards aren\u2019t met. At the same time, trust depends on fair, barrier-free access to services and participation\u2014through multilingual and disability-friendly communication, responsive local offices, and partnerships with trusted community groups like schools, libraries, faith organizations, and civic nonprofits. When institutions are transparent, accountable, secure, and genuinely inclusive, more people\u2014across ages, backgrounds, and political views\u2014can evaluate the evidence for themselves and feel confident the system works for everyone.",
