    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that rules are fair, decisions are evidence-based, and leaders are accountable regardless of party or status. Institutions should make their processes easy to understand (plain-language, multilingual communication), open key decisions and data to independent review (audits, inspector general reports, public dashboards), and explain not just what was decided but why\u2014along with clear paths to appeal or correct mistakes. Integrity also requires strong ethics standards, real consequences for misconduct, and protection from political or corporate pressure so outcomes don\u2019t feel \u201crigged.\u201d Finally, institutions should partner with trusted local groups\u2014schools, libraries, faith and civic organizations\u2014to listen regularly, answer questions, and demonstrate results in people\u2019s everyday lives, rebuilding confidence through consistent performance and transparent oversight.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see that rules are clear, applied consistently, and backed by evidence that can be independently checked. For elections, that means voter-verifiable paper ballots (or an equivalent paper record), strict chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting post\u2011election audits, and transparent public reporting of results and audit findings in plain language. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and bipartisan where appropriate, with well-trained, well-protected local administrators and opportunities for lawful public observation that protect voter privacy. Trust also depends on access: convenient, well-funded voting options (such as early voting and secure mail voting where available), disability accommodations, and multilingual information so every eligible voter can participate without confusion or barriers. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic and media literacy through schools and trusted community partners, and respond quickly and factually to errors, incidents, and misinformation\u2014so accountability is visible, not just promised.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on visible, verifiable fairness that ordinary people can understand and check for themselves. That means using auditable paper records (or voter-verifiable paper trails), strict chain-of-custody, routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits), and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with clear public reporting of what was tested, what was found, and how problems were fixed. Trust also depends on access and dignity: clear plain-language and multilingual information, disability-friendly design, convenient options like early voting and secure mail voting where allowed, and well-staffed local offices so working families and seniors aren\u2019t pushed out by long lines or confusing rules. Finally, institutions should communicate consistently and calmly\u2014sharing data, timelines, and corrections openly, protecting election workers from intimidation, and investing in civic and media literacy through schools and trusted community organizations\u2014so misinformation has less room to grow and people can see accountability in action.",
