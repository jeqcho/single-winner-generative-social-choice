    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, based on evidence, and with real consequences for mistakes or misconduct. Institutions should set clear, consistent rules; publish understandable data about performance and spending; and invite independent review\u2014through audits, inspectors general, citizen oversight panels, and transparent grievance processes\u2014so outcomes can be verified rather than taken on faith. Access matters too: services and information should be easy to use, available in plain language and multiple formats, and responsive to local needs, while protecting privacy and safety. Finally, leaders and staff should communicate early and honestly about problems, explain how they are being fixed, and enforce standards consistently regardless of politics\u2014because accountability, transparency, and respectful treatment are what turn skepticism into durable trust.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are made by clear rules, checked by independent reviewers, and communicated honestly in ways everyone can understand. For elections specifically, we should use voter\u2011verifiable paper ballots (or an equivalent paper record), protect strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody, and require routine post\u2011election risk\u2011limiting audits with public, plain\u2011language reports so communities can verify outcomes without relying on partisan claims. Oversight should be nonpartisan and bipartisan at the local level, with strong cybersecurity standards and transparent handling of any problems or incidents. At the same time, access must be practical and fair\u2014safe early voting and well\u2011secured mail options, accessible polling places, disability accommodations, and multilingual voter information\u2014so eligible voters can participate without unnecessary barriers. Finally, sustained civics and media\u2011literacy education through schools, libraries, and trusted community organizations can reduce misinformation and help people evaluate evidence, rebuilding confidence that institutions serve the public rather than politics.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see clear rules, fair treatment, and real accountability in everyday life\u2014not just in headlines. A practical way to rebuild that trust is to make decisions and results easy to verify: publish plain-language explanations of how policies are made, how money is spent, and how performance is measured; release timely reports (including when mistakes happen) and show what was fixed. Independent oversight\u2014audits, inspections, and ethics enforcement that are protected from political pressure\u2014should be routine, public, and understandable.\n\nTrust also depends on respectful access and service. Institutions should communicate in the languages people use at home (including Spanish), provide disability-friendly and senior-friendly services, keep processes simple, and offer reliable ways for the public to ask questions and get answers without being dismissed. Finally, institutions should partner with trusted local organizations\u2014schools, libraries, community groups, and faith communities\u2014to share accurate information, improve civic literacy, and address misinformation with facts. When transparency, accessibility, and accountability are built into the system, trust can be earned across different backgrounds and beliefs.",
