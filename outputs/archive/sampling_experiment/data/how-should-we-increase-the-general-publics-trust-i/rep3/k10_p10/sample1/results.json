    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in other public institutions\u2014grows when people can see that rules are applied consistently, mistakes are caught and fixed, and leaders explain decisions honestly. For elections, that means secure systems with an auditable paper record, routine post-election audits that are publicly reported in plain language, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and oversight that includes both major parties plus independent experts and community observers. Trust also depends on equal access: well-staffed polling places, reasonable early/mail options, language assistance where needed, and firm protections against intimidation. Finally, institutions should publish clear, timely information and corrections, share data without compromising privacy, and invest in nonpartisan civic education so rumors don\u2019t fill an information vacuum.",
