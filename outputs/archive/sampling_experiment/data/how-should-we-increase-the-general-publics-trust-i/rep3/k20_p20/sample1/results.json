    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are made by clear rules, tested evidence, and equal treatment\u2014rather than favoritism, secrecy, or partisan advantage. A practical middle ground is to make government processes more observable and checkable: publish understandable data and explanations, invite independent and cross-partisan oversight, protect whistleblowers, and require regular performance audits that measure outcomes (not just intentions). Institutions should be honest about mistakes, fix them publicly, and communicate early and plainly in multiple languages and accessible formats. At the same time, accountability must be real: enforce ethics standards, reduce conflicts of interest, and apply consequences consistently, while ensuring services are accessible and respectful to every community. When people experience competence, transparency, and fair treatment in everyday interactions\u2014schools, courts, public health, and elections\u2014trust can be rebuilt without asking anyone to \u201cjust believe.\u201d",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and independently verify that rules are fair, results are accurate, and everyone is treated equally. That means using secure, auditable voting systems (including voter-verifiable paper ballots or equivalent records), maintaining strict chain-of-custody, and conducting routine, bipartisan, independently reviewed post-election audits such as risk-limiting audits, with the findings published in plain language. Trust also requires nonpartisan administration and consistent, clearly explained procedures that are applied the same way across communities, alongside strong cybersecurity and timely, transparent reporting when problems occur and how they are fixed. At the same time, integrity must go hand-in-hand with access: clear registration, well-funded polling places, early and mail voting options with tracking where available, and multilingual and disability-friendly materials so every eligible voter can participate confidently. Finally, officials, civic leaders, and platforms should prioritize accurate information and responsible rhetoric\u2014encouraging evidence-based review and discouraging unfounded claims\u2014so people can verify the process for themselves rather than rely on partisan narratives.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should focus on standards people can see, verify, and experience as fair\u2014regardless of politics, background, or language. That starts with transparency: clear, timely explanations of how decisions are made, what evidence is used, who is responsible, and how the public can review outcomes. It also requires independent oversight and routine audits\u2014by inspectors general, bipartisan/nonpartisan boards, and qualified outside experts\u2014with findings published in plain language, alongside the underlying data when privacy and security allow.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions deliver basic competence and equal treatment: consistent rules, strong cybersecurity and records protection, clear service standards (wait times, response deadlines), and real consequences for mistakes, waste, or corruption. Public-facing information should be accessible and multilingual, with simple summaries for busy working people as well as detailed documentation for those who want to dig in.\n\nFinally, institutions should strengthen two-way accountability: make it easy to report problems, appeal decisions, and get a human response; hold regular community forums; and partner with schools, employers, unions, faith and community groups to improve civic education and counter misinformation with verified facts\u2014not partisan messaging. When people can verify the process, see fair enforcement, and get honest communication about problems and fixes, confidence rises over time.",
