    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014rises when people can verify that decisions are made fairly, competently, and without favoritism. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, common-sense safeguards (clear rules, secure record-keeping and chain-of-custody, routine independent audits with publicly posted results, and modern cybersecurity) with broad, barrier-free access and respectful service (adequate staffing, convenient options where lawful, disability and language accommodations, and timely plain-language explanations of what happened and why). Institutions should invite bipartisan and community observation, publish data and incident reports in understandable formats, and correct mistakes openly instead of defensively. Finally, sustained civics and media-literacy education\u2014delivered through schools and trusted local organizations\u2014can reduce misinformation while making it easier for people of any political view to accept outcomes because they can see the checks and accountability for themselves.",

We should prioritize simple, auditable processes (such as voter-verifiable paper records, strong chain-of-custody, and routine post\u2011election audits with publicly posted, plain\u2011language results), paired with strong cybersecurity and nonpartisan, bipartisan oversight at the local level. At the same time, institutions should communicate early and often in plain language and multiple languages, invite vetted observers from different perspectives, correct misinformation with evidence, and be transparent about problems and fixes. When accountability is visible, access is practical for working families and people with disabilities, and officials show integrity instead of spin, more people will accept outcomes and rebuild trust.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should focus on everyday proof of fairness: clear rules, transparent decision-making, and results that can be independently verified. That means setting consistent standards for how decisions are made and reviewed; publishing plain-language explanations, data, and timelines; and using routine, independent audits and public reporting so people can see what worked, what didn\u2019t, and how problems were fixed.\n\nTrust also requires institutions to be accessible and respectful to everyone. Information should be easy to find and available in the languages people use at home, with accommodations for disabilities and realistic options for working families and seniors. Local community partners\u2014schools, libraries, faith groups, and neighborhood organizations\u2014can help explain processes, host open forums, and connect residents with reliable information.\n\nFinally, institutions must earn confidence through accountability: clear ethics rules, protection from partisan interference, safe channels to report wrongdoing, and consequences when standards aren\u2019t met. When people can understand the process, verify outcomes, and see leaders correct mistakes openly, trust can grow across different communities and political views.",
