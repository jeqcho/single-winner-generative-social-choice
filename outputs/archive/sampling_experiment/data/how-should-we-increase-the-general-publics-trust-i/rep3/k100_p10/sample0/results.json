    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections increases when people can see\u2014without needing partisan faith\u2014that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and every eligible voter can participate. A practical middle ground is to set clear baseline standards across states while keeping local administration: auditable paper records or paper ballots, strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections, and routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results explained in plain language. Access should be protected through convenient options like early voting and mail voting where permitted, disability accommodations, and multilingual information, while reasonable identity and eligibility checks are applied in ways that don\u2019t create unnecessary barriers. Finally, consistent nonpartisan civic education and partnerships with trusted community organizations can counter misinformation and help residents understand how votes are cast, counted, and verified\u2014so confidence is earned through transparency and accountability.",

That means secure, auditable systems (including paper trails where feasible), strong cybersecurity, and routine independent post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) with timely, plain\u2011language public reporting of how results were protected, checked, and certified. At the same time, institutions should keep participation practical and fair for working, military/overseas, disabled, and multilingual communities by providing accessible voting options and communications, and by partnering with trusted local organizations to share accurate, nonpartisan information. Finally, sustained civic education and transparent responses to misinformation\u2014grounded in evidence rather than partisanship\u2014can help people see that rules are applied consistently and that every eligible person\u2019s voice is counted.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on three shared expectations: clear rules, equal access, and proof that outcomes are verified. That means using secure systems with auditable paper trails, strong cybersecurity, and routine independent, publicly reported audits (such as risk-limiting audits) so results can be checked without asking anyone to \u201cjust trust\u201d officials. It also means nonpartisan, consistent standards with local transparency: plain-language explanations of how registration, voting, counting, and certification work; open meetings and published data; and firm enforcement against fraud, intimidation, and corruption. At the same time, trust depends on fairness and accessibility\u2014multilingual and disability-friendly information, reasonable accommodations for working families and overseas voters, and voting options that reduce barriers while protecting integrity. Finally, institutions should partner with trusted community groups, schools, veterans\u2019 and faith organizations, labor and business leaders, and local media to provide practical civic education and quickly correct misinformation with verifiable facts. When people can see the safeguards, understand the process, and participate without unnecessary obstacles, confidence in institutions grows across political and cultural lines.",
