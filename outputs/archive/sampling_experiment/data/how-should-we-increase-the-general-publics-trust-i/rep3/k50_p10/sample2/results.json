    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that rules are applied fairly, decisions are explained clearly, and mistakes are acknowledged and corrected. We should set transparent standards for integrity (clear procedures, strong records, independent audits or oversight where appropriate), pair them with real accessibility (plain-language and multilingual communication, responsive service, and avenues for people to ask questions or appeal decisions), and publish easy-to-check performance data so the public can verify results rather than rely on rumors. Institutions should also invest in staff training, cybersecurity and privacy protections, and consistent enforcement\u2014while keeping oversight independent and insulated from partisan pressure. When communities are invited to observe, participate, and give feedback\u2014and when leaders communicate honestly, including about uncertainties\u2014confidence can grow across political and cultural lines.",
