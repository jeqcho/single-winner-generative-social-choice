We should pair strong, common-sense security (paper records or other auditable trails, clear chain-of-custody, and routine independent audits with public summaries) with broad, practical access (convenient voting options, disability accommodations, and accurate multilingual guidance). Institutions should communicate early and plainly about rules, changes, problems, and fixes; invite bipartisan and community observation that protects voter privacy; and publish data and performance measures so the public can see what worked and what improved. Consistent standards, well-trained and protected frontline staff, and ongoing civics and media literacy education can reduce misinformation and help people accept results\u2014even when they disagree with outcomes.",

We should use paper ballots (or an equivalent voter-verifiable paper record) with strict chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits conducted by independent, bipartisan reviewers, and timely public reporting that clearly explains what was checked and what was found. To ensure confidence across communities, election offices should provide plain-language, multilingual information about how ballots are cast, counted, and safeguarded, and offer accessible ways to vote (convenient polling places, early voting, and secure mail options) while applying rules consistently. When people can see transparent safeguards working\u2014without unnecessary barriers\u2014more voters will accept results and regain trust in the institutions that run elections.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decision-making and results easy for ordinary people to verify, and just as easy to participate in. That means clear, consistent rules; nonpartisan administration with bipartisan/independent oversight; paper-based or otherwise auditable records; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine, publicly reported post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) so the public can see how outcomes are confirmed. Trust also grows when institutions communicate early and often in plain language and multiple languages, correct misinformation with facts, and explain problems and fixes without spin. Finally, access must remain practical and fair for working people, seniors, people with disabilities, rural communities, and language minorities\u2014through convenient voting options, well-trained local staff, and community-based civic education\u2014so everyone can see the system is both secure and inclusive.",
