    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see that the rules are fair, the work is competent, and mistakes are caught and corrected. A practical middle ground is to combine broad access with strong verification: auditable paper records (or voter-verified paper backups), clear chain-of-custody procedures, routine risk-limiting audits, and transparent reporting of results and audit findings in plain language. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and locally grounded, with structured roles for observers from multiple parties and communities, clear ethics rules, and protections for workers so the process is orderly and safe. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often about what happened, what went wrong, and what will change\u2014using consistent public dashboards, independent reviews, and civics education\u2014so trust is earned through demonstrated accountability rather than slogans.",

Institutions should publish clear standards and data, open key processes to nonpartisan public observation, and use independent audits and oversight (with bipartisan representation where appropriate) to confirm that results match the rules. They should also enforce strong security and privacy protections, explain problems and fixes quickly, and invest in broad, practical civic education and multilingual information so people understand how decisions are made and how to raise concerns. When accountability, openness, and equal treatment are consistent\u2014especially at the local level\u2014confidence rises and misinformation loses power.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should make the most important decisions and services easier to verify, easier to understand, and fair for everyone\u2014without adding unnecessary barriers. That means clear, plain-language explanations of what institutions are doing and why (with timely public reporting), independent oversight and regular audits of performance and finances, and strong safeguards against conflicts of interest and corruption. It also means consistent rules that are applied evenly, real consequences for misconduct, and simple ways for people to ask questions, appeal decisions, and get help\u2014whether in English or Spanish and in formats accessible to people with disabilities. Finally, institutions should invest in community-facing outreach and civic education, correct mistakes openly, and protect frontline workers, so people can see accountable systems run by neighbors and professionals\u2014not by partisan influence.",
