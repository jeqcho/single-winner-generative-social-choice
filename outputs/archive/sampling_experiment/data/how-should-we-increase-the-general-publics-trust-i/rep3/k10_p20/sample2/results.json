    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when they are easy to understand, consistently fair, and visibly accountable\u2014especially when decisions affect daily life. A practical middle ground is to set clear, publicly available standards for how institutions make decisions and spend money, require independent oversight (audits, inspectors general, bipartisan/nonpartisan review where relevant), and publish timely plain-language reports on results, mistakes, and fixes. Institutions should make participation and access straightforward\u2014multilingual and disability-friendly information, simple complaint and appeal processes, open meetings and records where possible, and respectful customer-service style responsiveness\u2014while also protecting privacy and security. Finally, leaders should enforce strong ethics rules, consequences for misconduct, and regular opportunities for community input through trusted local partners, so people can see that rules apply to everyone and that feedback leads to measurable improvements.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, verify, and understand that the rules are fair and applied consistently to everyone. That means nonpartisan administration; secure, auditable voting with voter-verifiable paper records; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards; and routine independent risk-limiting audits with clear public reporting of results and any incidents. Trust also requires access and clarity: plain-language, multilingual, and disability-friendly information about how to register, vote, and how ballots are counted; well-funded polling places and options like early voting and secure mail voting where allowed; and partnerships with schools, libraries, faith and community organizations to share accurate, nonpartisan explanations and counter misinformation. When institutions communicate openly, invite observation, correct mistakes transparently, and protect every eligible voter from intimidation or undue barriers, confidence increases across parties and communities.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should focus on what people across backgrounds consistently ask for: clear rules, fair treatment, and proof that systems work as promised. Institutions should publish plain-language, multilingual information (including Spanish) about how decisions are made, what standards are used, and how the public can verify results. Independent oversight\u2014such as regular audits, open meetings, and publicly available performance metrics\u2014should be routine, with strong privacy and cybersecurity protections. Trust also grows when services are accessible and respectful: barrier-free options for people with disabilities, reasonable hours, responsive customer service, and reliable local points of contact like schools, libraries, veterans\u2019 groups, faith communities, and community organizations. When mistakes happen, institutions should acknowledge them quickly, explain what changed, and show follow-through. The goal is nonpartisan, transparent, and accountable institutions that people can understand, observe, and rely on in everyday life.",
