    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can verify that rules are fair, applied consistently, and enforced without favoritism. A practical middle ground is to pair broad access to participation (convenient in-person, early, and secure mail options; disability and language accommodations) with strong, visible safeguards (auditable paper records or equivalent verifiable trails, clear chain-of-custody, accurate voter rolls, and routine risk-limiting audits). Institutions should publish plain-language, publicly accessible reports on procedures, audit findings, and any errors or irregularities\u2014along with how they were fixed\u2014while protecting privacy and ballot secrecy. Finally, sustained civics and media-literacy education, delivered through trusted local partners and open public observation opportunities, can reduce misinformation and make accountability feel real rather than rhetorical.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on transparency people can see, rules people can understand, and accountability that applies to everyone. That means using verifiable voting with a paper record or equivalent auditable trail, strict chain-of-custody from casting to certification, and routine independent, bipartisan post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) with results reported publicly in plain language. We should also keep voting accessible and secure through well-funded local election offices, trained poll workers, strong cybersecurity, and clear options like in\u2011person, early, and secure mail voting with consistent standards and timely communication when problems occur. Finally, sustained nonpartisan civics and media\u2011literacy education\u2014delivered through schools and trusted community channels and available in multiple languages\u2014can reduce misinformation and help people verify facts for themselves, so confidence is built on evidence rather than rhetoric.",
