    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and independently verify that rules are fair and applied consistently. A practical middle ground is to pair broad access with strong, observable safeguards: reliable paper records or other durable backups, routine risk\u2011limiting audits with publicly posted results, transparent chain\u2011of\u2011custody, and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with clear roles and accountability. Institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual language; publish timely, easy-to-read explanations of decisions and incidents; and invite community observation and questions without turning administration into a partisan fight. Finally, sustained investment in local staffing, cybersecurity, civics and media literacy education, and protections for both voting rights and ballot privacy can reduce confusion, deter misconduct, and make confidence in outcomes a matter of evidence rather than rhetoric.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the process easy to understand, independently verifiable, and consistently administered. That means clear, plain-language explanations of how ballots are cast, protected, counted, audited, and certified; auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verified backups); routine, public, independent risk-limiting audits; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and transparent reporting that promptly explains and fixes any problems. Trust also grows when rules are applied fairly across jurisdictions, voting remains accessible for eligible voters (including disability and language access), and nonpartisan civic and media literacy education helps people evaluate claims and resist misinformation. When people can see the evidence, observe oversight, and get timely, honest answers from accountable officials, confidence in outcomes\u2014and in our broader institutions\u2014can rise.",

That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; secure, verifiable voting with a paper trail (or other voter-verifiable record); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine independent, publicly reported audits so results can be checked and explained.\n\nTrust also depends on equal access and respectful treatment: clear, plain-language guidance in English and Spanish; accommodations for disabilities; well-trained, adequately funded local offices; and voting options that work for busy workers and families while protecting ballot privacy. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and honestly when problems occur\u2014showing what happened, what was fixed, and how it will be prevented\u2014while investing in civic and media literacy so communities can spot misinformation and rely on evidence rather than rumor.",
