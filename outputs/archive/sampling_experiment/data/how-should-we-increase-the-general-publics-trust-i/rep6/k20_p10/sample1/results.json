    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the rules and the evidence visible, consistent, and easy for everyday people to verify. That means nonpartisan, professionally run administration; clear, plain-language explanations of how decisions are made and how votes are counted; and routine, independent audits with public reporting so errors are found and fixed transparently. We should protect both access and integrity through secure chain-of-custody procedures, strong cybersecurity, accurate voter rolls with regular, accountable maintenance, and reasonable identity verification options that do not create undue barriers for eligible voters. Trust grows when institutions communicate early and often, provide multilingual information, partner with trusted local organizations, and welcome bipartisan public observation\u2014while also investing in civics and media literacy so communities can judge claims against facts.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on transparency, consistency, and accountability that people can verify for themselves. Institutions should be led and overseen through clearly nonpartisan, professional administration; use secure, auditable systems (including voter-verifiable paper records or equivalent audit logs); maintain strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections; and conduct routine, independent post-process audits with timely public reporting of results and any corrective actions. Rules and procedures should be stable and consistent across jurisdictions, communicated well in advance, and designed to protect both access for eligible participants and the integrity of outcomes, including accurate, well-maintained records. Finally, trust grows when institutions communicate in plain language, provide multilingual and community-based education, and partner with trusted local organizations to counter misinformation and help the public understand how decisions are made and how safeguards work.",

That means nonpartisan administration; consistent procedures that don\u2019t change at the last minute; secure, auditable systems (including voter-verifiable paper records or equivalent); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; accurate, regularly maintained voter rolls; and routine, transparent post-process audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with public reporting of findings and fixes. Trust also depends on access and understanding: provide practical voting options that work for busy families, seniors, and working people; ensure polling places are well-resourced; and share plain-language, multilingual explanations\u2014delivered through trusted local messengers like schools, community groups, workplaces, and faith communities\u2014so people can see how decisions are made, how errors are corrected, and how everyone\u2019s rights are protected under the same fair rules.",
