    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014rises when people can clearly see that the rules are fair, the work is competent, and mistakes are caught and fixed. We should standardize clear baseline procedures across jurisdictions (while allowing local administration), publish plain-language explanations of every step from registration to final certification, and provide open data and public dashboards that show turnout, counting timelines, and how discrepancies are resolved. Security and access must be strengthened together: secure paper records or equivalent voter-verifiable backups, strong chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and independent oversight with transparent reporting, alongside practical voting options and accommodations so eligible voters can participate without unnecessary barriers. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often\u2014acknowledging uncertainty, correcting errors publicly, and partnering with trusted local groups, schools, and media to build civic and media literacy so misinformation has less room to spread.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make key processes transparent, consistent, and verifiable for everyday people. That means clear rules that don\u2019t change at the last minute, secure handling of ballots with strong chain-of-custody, and routine independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with public reporting of findings and any corrective actions. Institutions should be overseen in a genuinely nonpartisan, bipartisan way, with plain-language explanations, open observation where appropriate, and timely disclosure of incidents so misinformation has less room to grow. At the same time, trust depends on fairness and access: convenient, secure ways to participate; accessible and multilingual information; and sustained civic education and local community outreach so people understand how decisions are made, how problems are caught, and why everyone\u2019s voice is counted.",

That means clear, consistent rules; nonpartisan, professionally run administration; and strong safeguards that are visible and routine, such as secure ballot handling and chain-of-custody, paper records where feasible, and regular independent audits with publicly posted findings and fixes. Trust also grows when institutions communicate in plain language (and multiple languages where needed), respond quickly and transparently to mistakes or concerns, and invite credible community oversight so people can see how problems are handled. Finally, investing in civics education and media literacy, along with accessible ways to participate, helps families understand the process, reduces misinformation, and reinforces the shared principle that everyone\u2019s voice should be protected and counted fairly.",
