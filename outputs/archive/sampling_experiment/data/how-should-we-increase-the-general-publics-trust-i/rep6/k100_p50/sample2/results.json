    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the work observable, and the results independently verifiable. That means transparent procedures that are applied consistently, secure systems with a voter-verifiable record (such as paper ballots or equivalent), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine post-election audits whose methods and findings are published in plain language. Participation should be convenient and fair for eligible voters through well-funded local administration, accessible options, and language-appropriate information, while reasonable identity and eligibility checks and accurate voter rolls are maintained to prevent errors and deter fraud. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and honestly when problems occur, invite bipartisan and community observation, and invest in ongoing civics and media literacy so people can judge claims for themselves and feel confident the system works for everyone.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, verify, and understand how decisions are made and how mistakes are caught and corrected. We should adopt transparent, consistently applied rules; use secure, auditable voting systems with a voter-verifiable paper record (or equivalent); protect strict chain-of-custody; and conduct routine, publicly reported, independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible) with bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight and open observation. At the same time, voting should remain accessible for eligible citizens through well-run in-person, early, and secure mail options, with strong privacy protections, adequate funding for local election offices, and clear, plain-language, multilingual communication about procedures, results, and any anomalies. Finally, sustained civic and media-literacy education\u2014paired with timely, factual responses to misinformation\u2014can help communities evaluate evidence, hold officials accountable, and rebuild confidence that institutions serve everyone fairly.",
