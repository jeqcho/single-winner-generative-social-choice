    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, how money is spent, and what happens when mistakes occur. We should set clear, nonpartisan standards for transparency (plain-language explanations, open data where privacy allows, and public reporting of performance), pair them with strong integrity safeguards (independent audits, conflict-of-interest rules, and protections for whistleblowers), and enforce real accountability when standards aren\u2019t met. Just as important, institutions should communicate consistently and humbly\u2014sharing evidence, acknowledging uncertainty, correcting errors quickly, and engaging communities through local forums and trusted messengers. By making systems easier to understand, easier to verify, and harder to corrupt, we can rebuild confidence across different political and cultural viewpoints.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the process is transparent, secure, and verifiable\u2014so people can see evidence that results are accurate, not just be asked to believe it. That means using auditable voting systems with a voter-verifiable paper record, routine public post-election audits, strong cybersecurity, and independent, bipartisan oversight from ballot design through certification. Trust also depends on accessibility and clear communication: consistent rules, convenient voting options, plain-language explanations of how ballots are protected and counted, timely reporting of results, and ongoing nonpartisan civics education. Finally, election offices should be accountable and supported to resist political pressure, address problems openly, and counter misinformation with accurate, publicly available information.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on actions people can see, check, and understand. That means transparent, secure, and verifiable processes: paper-backed records or equivalent voter-verifiable receipts, routine risk-limiting post-election audits, strong cybersecurity, and clear chain-of-custody rules from ballot casting to certification. Oversight should be independent and bipartisan, with public reporting of audit results, mistakes, and fixes, so accountability is real rather than rhetorical.\n\nTrust also depends on fair access and respectful treatment. Institutions should make it straightforward for eligible people to participate through well-staffed polling places, accessible ballots, reasonable early and mail voting options, and clear, consistent rules. Communication should be plain-language, multilingual where needed, and delivered through trusted local partners\u2014schools, libraries, community organizations, and nonpartisan civic groups\u2014so people can learn how decisions are made, how to verify outcomes, and how to report problems. Finally, leaders and agencies should commit to the same standard everywhere: tell the truth quickly, correct errors publicly, protect frontline workers from harassment, and demonstrate\u2014with evidence\u2014that rules are enforced equally for everyone.",
