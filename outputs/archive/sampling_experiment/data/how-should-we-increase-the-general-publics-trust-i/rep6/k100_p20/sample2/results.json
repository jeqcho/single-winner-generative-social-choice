That means clear, publicly available rules; transparent reporting of performance and outcomes; independent oversight and regular audits; strong privacy and security protections; and straightforward ways for the public to ask questions, appeal decisions, and get timely answers. Institutions should communicate in plain language through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, faith and community groups), invest in civic and media literacy, and separate essential services from partisan influence by enforcing ethics standards, disclosing conflicts of interest, and holding leaders accountable regardless of party.",

Finally, strong voter education and media\u2011literacy efforts\u2014delivered through trusted local institutions like libraries, schools, and community groups\u2014can reduce misinformation while ensuring convenient, barrier\u2011free voting options for all eligible citizens.",

It also means nonpartisan, transparent administration; strong cybersecurity and chain\u2011of\u2011custody protections; and practical access supports like language assistance, disability accommodations, and multiple voting options that keep ballot secrecy intact. Finally, trust increases when institutions partner with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, community groups, faith organizations, and service providers\u2014to provide nonpartisan civic education, media\u2011literacy tools, and clear channels for questions and complaints, so people rely less on rumor and more on verifiable facts.",
