    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections rises when people can verify results for themselves and feel the rules are fair, consistent, and applied equally. A practical middle ground is to use voting systems with a voter-verifiable paper record, routine risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and clear public reporting of procedures, findings, and any problems found and fixed. Election offices should be nonpartisan and open to bipartisan and independent observation, with prompt investigations of credible irregularities and transparent outcomes. At the same time, participation should remain accessible through well-run in-person and mail options, plain-language and multilingual information, well-trained poll workers, and ongoing civics and media-literacy education to reduce confusion and misinformation.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in key institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make integrity easy to verify, rules easy to understand, and participation fair and accessible. That means nonpartisan, professionally run processes with clear standards applied consistently; verifiable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails where technology is used); routine, independent post-process audits (including risk-limiting audits) with strong chain-of-custody and open observation; and transparent, timely public reporting in plain language. Trust also improves when institutions invest in modern security and cybersecurity, promptly investigate credible irregularities, and communicate findings without spin. Finally, sustained civic education and nonpartisan, multilingual public information\u2014delivered through schools, libraries, and community partners\u2014can reduce misinformation and help people understand how oversight and verification work. Where identification or voter-roll safeguards are used, they should be implemented in ways that protect privacy and do not create unnecessary barriers for eligible participants.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy for everyday people to verify, while keeping participation fair and accessible. That means using transparent, consistently applied rules; secure, auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails); routine post-election risk-limiting audits; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards; and clear opportunities for bipartisan and independent observers to see processes firsthand. Trust also requires plain-language, multilingual public information (including Spanish in many communities), well-trained staff, and timely public reporting that explains what happened, what safeguards were used, and how concerns are investigated and resolved. Finally, strengthening civics education and media literacy, and partnering with schools, libraries, employers, and community organizations to share nonpartisan guidance, can reduce misinformation and help people feel confident that institutions earn trust through transparency, accountability, and equal treatment under the rules.",
