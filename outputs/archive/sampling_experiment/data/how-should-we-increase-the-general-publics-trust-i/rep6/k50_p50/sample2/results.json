    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the work of government easier to verify, easier to understand, and more responsive when problems occur. That means clear, consistently applied rules; secure, auditable systems with a voter-verifiable record; routine independent post-election audits with results posted publicly in plain language; and strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections. At the same time, participation should be practical for working people and people with disabilities through well-run in-person voting, secure early options, and carefully safeguarded mail voting where used, with accurate voter rolls and reasonable identity and eligibility checks that protect access as well as integrity. Finally, trust grows when institutions communicate early and honestly, partner with local community leaders for multilingual civic education, protect election workers and whistleblowers, and correct mistakes transparently so accountability is visible to everyone\u2014not filtered through partisan spin.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared, practical commitments: make decisions and results verifiable, communicate them clearly, and treat people fairly.\n\nFirst, strengthen transparency and accountability: use systems that produce a voter-verifiable record (such as paper ballots or robust audit trails), conduct routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible), protect chain-of-custody, and publish audit methods and results in plain language so the public can see how outcomes are confirmed.\n\nSecond, pair security with access: invest in cybersecurity, secure voter rolls, and well-trained election staff, while also ensuring eligible voters can participate through convenient, secure options (in-person, early, and mail where offered), accessible polling places, and strong privacy protections.\n\nThird, communicate consistently and locally: provide clear, multilingual information (including Spanish where needed), explain procedures and timelines upfront, respond quickly to problems with documented corrective actions, and partner with trusted community institutions\u2014schools, libraries, faith groups, and nonpartisan civic organizations\u2014to expand civic and media literacy and reduce misinformation.\n\nIf institutions consistently show their work, correct errors openly, and make participation both secure and practical, more people\u2014across ages, backgrounds, and political views\u2014can have confidence that rules are fair and outcomes are legitimate.",
