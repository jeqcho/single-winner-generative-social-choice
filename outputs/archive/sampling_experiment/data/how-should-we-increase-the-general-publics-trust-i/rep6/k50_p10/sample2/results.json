    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can plainly see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and everyone is treated equally. We should use voting systems with verifiable records (such as paper trails), routine independent audits, strong cybersecurity, and clear chain-of-custody procedures that allow bipartisan and public observation without disrupting operations. At the same time, we should protect broad, lawful access to voting and provide consistent, multilingual, nonpartisan explanations of how registration, voting, counting, and certification work, including prompt disclosure of problems and how they\u2019re fixed. Reasonable identity and eligibility checks should be accurate, accessible, and applied uniformly so they deter fraud without discouraging eligible voters. When institutions communicate clearly, correct mistakes transparently, and enforce rules consistently, misinformation has less room to spread and confidence can be rebuilt.",

We should strengthen transparent, nonpartisan administration with auditable paper records (or equally verifiable backups), routine post\u2011election audits, strong cybersecurity, and a documented chain of custody for ballots and equipment. Voter eligibility and voter rolls should be maintained accurately with safeguards that prevent improper voting while avoiding unnecessary barriers for eligible voters, and election rules should be applied consistently with bipartisan and public observation where appropriate. Just as important, officials must communicate plainly and promptly\u2014before, during, and after Election Day\u2014explaining how ballots are cast, counted, audited, and certified, correcting errors quickly, and countering misinformation with accessible civics education and multilingual outreach. With adequate funding for election offices and strong protections for voting rights, people can see that elections are fair, accountable, and worthy of confidence.",

Institutions should apply rules consistently, enforce strong ethics standards, and investigate mistakes or misconduct quickly with public follow\u2011up on what changed. Access and inclusion matter: services and information should be easy to use, available in multiple languages, and designed so everyone\u2014seniors, people with disabilities, and underserved communities\u2014can participate and be heard.
