We should pair strong security with broad access: maintain accurate voter registration lists with transparent, routinely reviewed procedures; use auditable voting systems (such as paper records) with risk-limiting post-election audits; and provide consistent standards, training, and funding for local election offices. Independent, bipartisan oversight and public reporting of audit results and security practices can reassure skeptics without making voting harder for eligible citizens. Finally, officials and trusted community partners should communicate early and often in plain, multilingual, accessible formats to explain how ballots are cast, counted, and certified, and to correct misinformation with timely facts and accountability.",

We should ensure every ballot has a reliable paper record (or equivalent), conduct routine risk-limiting audits, publish transparent chain-of-custody and security updates, and provide independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with meaningful public observation. Institutions should be properly funded and professionally staffed, keep accurate records, and enforce rules fairly with proportionate penalties for proven wrongdoing. Just as important, officials must communicate early and often in plain, multilingual, and accessible formats (including disability access), proactively counter misinformation with verifiable facts, and offer broad, safe options to participate so every eligible person can take part with confidence and dignity.",
