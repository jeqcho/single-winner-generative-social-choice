    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and independently confirm that the same fair rules are followed for everyone. That means transparent procedures from registration to certification; secure, auditable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent voter-verifiable backups); routine, publicly reported post-election audits; and clear chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and open to credentialed observers from multiple parties and community groups, with timely, plain-language explanations (and language and disability access) about what happened, what went wrong if anything, and how it was fixed. At the same time, institutions should make participation practical\u2014reasonable access to in-person and mail/early options with appropriate safeguards\u2014and invest in ongoing civic and media literacy so people can evaluate claims, spot misinformation, and hold officials accountable based on evidence rather than rhetoric.",

When problems arise, officials should investigate quickly, report what happened transparently, correct errors, and enforce rules consistently\u2014without partisan spin.
