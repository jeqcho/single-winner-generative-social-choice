    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014improves when people can independently see that the rules are fair, the work is competent, and mistakes are corrected openly. We should set clear, consistent procedures for voting and counting; use verifiable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable audit trails); protect ballots with strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and require routine, publicly reported audits with meaningful access for bipartisan and independent observers. At the same time, participation should be practical and inclusive through well-funded local offices, accessible polling places and ballot formats, reasonable options for early and mail voting with safeguards, and clear guidance for voter eligibility and roll maintenance with due process for corrections. Finally, institutions should communicate in plain language, publish timely data and explanations, and invest in ongoing civics and media literacy so disagreements are settled by evidence rather than rumor.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should pair strong, common-sense security with radical clarity and public accountability. That means clear, consistent rules; verifiable records (paper ballots or voter-verified audit trails); strict chain-of-custody and well-maintained voter rolls; routine, independent risk\u2011limiting audits with results published in plain language; and open observation by bipartisan and nonpartisan monitors. Institutions should communicate early and often about how decisions are made, what went wrong (if anything), and how issues were fixed\u2014using multilingual, accessible formats and trusted local partners such as schools, libraries, and community groups. Finally, sustained civics and media\u2011literacy education, along with robust cybersecurity and adequate funding for frontline staff, can help people see the evidence for fairness, resist misinformation, and feel confident that rules are enforced equally and every eligible voice is respected.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on results people can verify, rules people can understand, and service people can access. That means clear, consistent standards; transparent, well-documented procedures; and independent oversight with publicly released audit findings and explanations in plain language and multiple languages. Institutions should protect privacy and civil rights while strengthening practical security (e.g., secure records, strong cybersecurity, careful chain-of-custody) and offering convenient, accessible options so eligible people\u2014including seniors, working families, and voters with disabilities\u2014can participate without unnecessary barriers. Just as important, leaders and agencies should communicate honestly about problems, investigate concerns quickly, publish what was found and what was fixed, and invest in ongoing civics and media literacy education so misinformation has less room to spread. Trust grows when institutions are nonpartisan in administration, accountable for mistakes, and transparent enough that people with different politics can see the same evidence and reach the same conclusions.",
