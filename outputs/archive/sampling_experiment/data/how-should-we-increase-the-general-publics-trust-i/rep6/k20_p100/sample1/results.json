    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is rebuilt when people can see, understand, and verify how decisions are made\u2014and when leaders are held accountable for results. Institutions should commit to clear, consistent rules; publish plain-language explanations, budgets, performance data, and the reasoning behind major decisions; and invite independent oversight (audits, inspectors general, citizen review panels, and courts) that is protected from partisan pressure. At the same time, services must feel fair in practice: equal enforcement, respectful treatment, strong privacy protections, and reliable access for all communities. Finally, institutions should respond quickly and openly to mistakes\u2014investigating concerns, correcting problems, and communicating what changed\u2014while supporting civic and media literacy so the public can distinguish evidence from rumor. Transparency plus accountability, delivered with competence and respect, is the most durable path to renewed trust.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on reforms people can see, verify, and understand. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration with clear rules; secure, auditable systems (such as paper ballots or voter\u2011verified records); routine independent risk\u2011limiting audits with publicly released results; and strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity protections from registration through certification. Trust also depends on equal access: convenient and secure in\u2011person, early, and mail options; disability and language accommodations; and well\u2011resourced local offices with trained staff. Finally, institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual language, promptly explain and correct mistakes, and invest in civics and media\u2011literacy education and community outreach so misinformation has less room to grow and people can judge the evidence for themselves.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few simple, shared principles: make important decisions easy to see, easy to check, and fair for everyone. That means clear, consistent rules; transparent step\u2011by\u2011step explanations in plain language; and independent oversight that regularly audits and publicly reports what worked, what didn\u2019t, and what was fixed. For elections specifically, using auditable records (like paper ballots or voter\u2011verifiable backups), strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity, and routine post\u2011election audits with bipartisan/independent observers can give people proof\u2014not just assurances\u2014that results are accurate. Trust also grows when access is protected: safe, well\u2011staffed polling places; reasonable options for early, mail, and in\u2011person voting with safeguards; accommodations for disabilities; and language access where needed. Finally, institutions should invest in year\u2011round civics and media\u2011literacy education and partner with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, community groups, faith communities, and veterans\u2019 and service organizations\u2014so accurate information travels farther than rumors and people feel respected, heard, and able to verify the facts for themselves.",
