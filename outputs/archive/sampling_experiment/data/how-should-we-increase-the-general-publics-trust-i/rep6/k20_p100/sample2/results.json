Institutions should communicate early and often through trusted local channels, publish data and timelines, investigate problems transparently, and hold officials accountable regardless of party. Finally, sustained civics and media-literacy education\u2014and respectful opportunities for public observation and feedback\u2014can reduce misinformation and help people feel that the system is fair, lawful, and responsive.",

Institutions should also expand practical access and accommodations (reasonable hours, early/mail options with safeguards, disability access, and multilingual information) so eligible people can engage without unnecessary barriers.
