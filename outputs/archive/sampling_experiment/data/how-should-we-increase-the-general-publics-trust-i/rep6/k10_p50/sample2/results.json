    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, check the evidence for themselves, and witness real consequences for mistakes and misconduct. A practical middle ground is to make core public processes\u2014like elections, public spending, and major policy decisions\u2014more transparent and independently verifiable: publish clear, plain-language explanations of rules and outcomes; release timely, privacy-protected data; use routine independent audits and public reports; and maintain secure records and chain-of-custody where relevant. At the same time, institutions should make participation and services genuinely accessible through consistent rules, strong customer-service standards, language and disability accommodations, and multiple secure ways for people to engage. Finally, leaders should communicate early and honestly, correct errors quickly, protect whistleblowers, and enforce accountable ethics standards\u2014so trust is earned through observable fairness, competence, and integrity rather than partisan assurances.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on processes people can see, understand, and verify. That means clear, consistent rules; secure and auditable systems (including voter-verified paper records or equivalent backups); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine, independent, publicly reported audits that explain what was checked and what was found in plain language. Trust also grows when administration is demonstrably nonpartisan and accountable: problems are acknowledged quickly, investigated transparently, and corrected with documented fixes.\n\nAt the same time, institutions should make participation straightforward and fair for every eligible person by offering accessible options (well-run in-person voting, secure absentee/mail where used, accommodations for disabilities, and language access), well-trained staff, and reliable local information that counters misinformation with evidence and timely updates. When people can observe safeguards, verify results, and feel respected in the process, confidence in institutions rises across communities and political viewpoints.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on practices people can see, verify, and understand. That means clear, consistent rules; secure and accessible ways to participate (in-person and, where used, well-verified absentee/mail options); and verifiable records such as paper ballots or voter-verified audit trails backed by strict chain-of-custody. Results should be checked through routine, independent risk-limiting audits and transparent post-election reporting, with bipartisan/nonpartisan observers able to monitor key steps and with problems investigated quickly and publicly.\n\nTrust also depends on communication and service: plain-language explanations of how systems work, timely updates, multilingual and disability-accessible materials, well-trained frontline staff, and stable funding for local offices. Finally, invest in civic education and media literacy through schools, libraries, and community groups, and respond to misinformation with evidence, open data where appropriate, and respectful engagement\u2014so confidence is built on transparency, fairness, and accountability rather than partisan claims.",
