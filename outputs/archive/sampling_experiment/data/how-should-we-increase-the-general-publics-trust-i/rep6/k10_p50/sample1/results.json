Transparency should be real and practical: open observation, timely explanations when problems occur, and prompt corrective action with accountability for misconduct. At the same time, institutions should make participation straightforward and inclusive\u2014reasonable access options, disability and language accommodations, and reliable local staffing\u2014so security does not become a barrier. Finally, sustained civic and media literacy education and nonpartisan community outreach can reduce misinformation and help people evaluate evidence, so trust is earned through demonstrated performance rather than rhetoric.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make key processes transparent, verifiable, and nonpartisan, and communicate them in plain language. That means using auditable records (such as voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent verifiable trails), conducting routine independent post-election audits with publicly posted results, and maintaining strong security practices like chain-of-custody protections and cybersecurity upgrades. Trust also grows when rules are clear and consistently applied, voting and public services are accessible to all eligible people (including language and disability accommodations), and local offices are well-resourced to respond quickly and honestly to problems. Finally, sustained civics education, media literacy, and community outreach\u2014paired with respectful, evidence-based leadership and bipartisan/independent oversight\u2014can reduce misinformation, increase accountability, and help people see that institutions work fairly for everyone.",

That means clear, consistently applied rules; transparent decision-making; and independent oversight that is credible across political viewpoints. For elections specifically, use verifiable paper records or voter-verifiable audit trails, strict chain-of-custody, and routine risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language. Make information easy to access in multiple languages (including Spanish) and formats (including disability accommodations), and provide simple step-by-step explanations of what happens from registration to certification.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions communicate honestly and quickly: acknowledge problems, correct them publicly, protect whistleblowers, and share data that allows independent review while safeguarding privacy and ballot secrecy. Finally, ensure access is real for working families and older voters\u2014safe polling places, reasonable hours, secure early/mail options with safeguards, and well-trained, respectful staff\u2014paired with ongoing civics and media-literacy education so people can evaluate claims calmly and rely on evidence rather than rumors.",
