We should set transparent, consistent standards for how ballots are issued, secured, counted, and certified; use verifiable records (such as paper trails or equivalent audits); and require routine, publicly reported audits and investigations of credible problems with clear timelines for fixes. At the same time, institutions should make participation practical and equal\u2014safe, accessible voting options; disability and language accommodations; well-funded local offices and trained staff\u2014so integrity doesn\u2019t come at the cost of access. Finally, leaders and agencies should communicate in plain language, publish data and decisions proactively, protect privacy, and partner with trusted community organizations and schools to strengthen civic and media literacy and reduce misinformation without partisan spin.",

Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and open to bipartisan observers, with audit results published in clear, accessible formats. At the same time, institutions should protect equal access and voter privacy by offering secure options (early, mail, and in\u2011person) and providing language and disability accommodations.

Trust also grows when access is real for everyone: convenient and secure voting options, well\u2011resourced polling places, and reliable accommodations for disabilities and language needs. Finally, institutions should communicate early and honestly about problems, investigate irregularities promptly, protect whistleblowers, and invest in ongoing civic and media literacy education through schools and trusted local community partners so misinformation has less room to spread.",
