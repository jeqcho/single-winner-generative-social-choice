    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is rebuilt when people can see clear standards, honest performance, and real consequences for mistakes\u2014regardless of politics. We should make key decisions and outcomes transparent and independently verifiable (public reporting in plain language, open data where privacy allows, regular third\u2011party audits, and strong conflict\u2011of\u2011interest rules), while also making services easy and fair to use (accessible processes, consistent rules, and respectful treatment for every community, including multilingual and disability access). Institutions should communicate early and calmly, correct errors publicly, protect whistleblowers, and invite ongoing community oversight through nonpartisan local forums. When institutions are both accountable and genuinely responsive, trust becomes something they earn and can keep.",

That means using auditable records (like paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), strict chain-of-custody and clean voter rolls, strong cybersecurity, and routine post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) conducted with bipartisan/independent oversight and public reporting. At the same time, participation should be practical and fair: clear, consistent procedures, accessible polling places, reasonable early and secure mail voting options with tracking, and plain-language, multilingual information so every eligible voter knows how to vote and how results are checked. Finally, officials should communicate quickly and calmly about problems and fixes, invest in civics education and local community outreach, and counter misinformation with transparent data\u2014so confidence is earned through accountability rather than partisan spin.",
