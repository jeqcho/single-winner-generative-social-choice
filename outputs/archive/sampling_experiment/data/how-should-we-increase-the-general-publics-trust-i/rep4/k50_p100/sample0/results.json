    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when rules are clear, performance is measurable, and accountability is real. We should make election administration transparently verifiable (auditable paper records or equivalent, routine risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody, and hardened cybersecurity) while also making participation practical (safe early and mail options, accessible polling places, disability accommodations, and clear multilingual instructions). Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and publicly visible, with opportunities for bipartisan observers and prompt, plain-language reporting of results, problems found, and how they were fixed. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education and rapid, fact-based responses to misinformation so people don\u2019t have to rely on rumors to understand what happened and why the outcome is credible.",

We should use verifiable paper ballots (or voter-verified records), maintain strict chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity, and conduct routine, publicly reported post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits) with bipartisan and nonpartisan oversight. At the same time, voting should be practical and accessible for every eligible voter: clear registration and eligibility rules, convenient early and mail options where used, accessible polling places, and plain-language, multilingual instructions and updates. Finally, well-funded local election offices, strong civics education, and timely, factual communication\u2014especially when problems arise\u2014can counter misinformation and demonstrate accountability, so confidence is earned through transparency and reliable performance rather than partisan rhetoric.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should earn confidence through transparency, consistent rules, and real accountability, not slogans. That means using verifiable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable backups), strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible) with results published quickly in plain language.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions are accessible and respectful: clear, nonpartisan information about rules and deadlines; language access for multilingual households; accommodations for people with disabilities; and practical options that fit working families and seniors (reasonable polling locations and hours, early voting where supported, and secure tracked mail voting where used). Finally, institutions should invite community oversight\u2014bipartisan observers, local officials, and trusted civic partners\u2014and respond promptly to errors and misinformation with evidence, corrections, and consequences when standards aren\u2019t met. When people can see how decisions are made, verify outcomes, and experience fair treatment, trust becomes deserved and durable.",
