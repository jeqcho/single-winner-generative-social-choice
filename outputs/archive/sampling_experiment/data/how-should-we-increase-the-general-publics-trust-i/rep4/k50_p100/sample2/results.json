    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see clear standards, consistent enforcement, and real accountability\u2014without institutions becoming partisan actors. A practical middle ground is to make key processes more transparent and verifiable (public performance metrics, plain-language reports, independent audits, and open records with strong privacy protections), while also improving everyday service and fairness (simple rules, accessible channels, multilingual communication, and reasonable safeguards against fraud or misuse). Institutions should admit mistakes quickly, explain what changed, and invite structured community oversight\u2014citizen panels, bipartisan or cross-partisan observers, and partnerships with trusted local organizations\u2014so feedback is heard and improvements are measurable. When institutions are competent, honest about tradeoffs, and willing to be checked, trust can be earned across political and cultural lines.",

We should build that trust through transparent, auditable systems (such as voter-verified paper records and routine independent risk-limiting audits), strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity safeguards, and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with clear, plain-language public reporting of results and any corrections. At the same time, participation should be practical and dignified: accessible polling places, reasonable options like early voting and secure mail voting with tracking where available, and multilingual, disability-accessible information so every eligible voter can cast a ballot confidently. Finally, sustained local civics education and timely, factual communication from trusted community partners can reduce confusion and misinformation\u2014so trust is earned through demonstrated integrity, not partisan rhetoric.",
