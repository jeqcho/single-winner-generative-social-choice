    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, verify, and understand how decisions are made, and when rules are applied consistently and respectfully to everyone. We should pair broad access to participation (clear registration, convenient voting options, disability and language accommodations) with strong, evenhanded safeguards (secure chain-of-custody, tested equipment, voter-verifiable records, regular independent audits, and transparent correction of errors). Institutions should publish plain-language, timely explanations of procedures, results, and audit findings; welcome bipartisan and community observation; and respond quickly to misinformation with evidence rather than rhetoric. By investing in competent, nonpartisan administration and ongoing civic education through trusted local partners, we earn confidence through demonstrated reliability, fairness, and accountability.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules and results easy for ordinary people to verify. That means using durable, auditable records (such as voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent), enforcing strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and conducting routine, publicly reported post-election audits by independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan teams. Trust also grows when access is straightforward and fair: clear registration and eligibility rules, polling places and ballots that are accessible (including for people with disabilities), and accurate information in plain language and multiple languages. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and calmly about what happened, what safeguards were used, and how concerns are investigated and corrected\u2014so accountability is visible, misinformation has less room to spread, and confidence is earned through transparent performance rather than rhetoric.",

That means transparent, well-documented procedures; durable records that can be independently checked (such as voter-verified paper records); routine post-event audits with publicly posted results; strong cybersecurity and secure chain-of-custody; and clear, consistent rules that are explained before, during, and after major decisions. Trust also depends on inclusion and everyday usability: plain-language and multilingual information, disability accommodations, and practical options that let eligible people participate without unnecessary hurdles. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and calmly when problems occur, publish what was fixed, invite nonpartisan observation from across the community, and fund local offices well enough to do the job right\u2014because confidence grows when fairness is visible and accountability is real.",
