    "new_statement": "To rebuild the general public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared basics: make the rules clear, make the process verifiable, and treat every community with equal respect. That means using voter-verifiable records (like paper ballots or paper backups), routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results published publicly in plain language, and strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections from ballot creation through final certification. Trust also rises when oversight is genuinely nonpartisan and community-grounded: bipartisan observers, transparent reporting of problems and fixes, and well-funded local offices that can train staff and run elections competently. At the same time, access should be practical for working families, seniors, rural voters, and people with disabilities\u2014reasonable polling locations and hours, secure early and mail options where used, and straightforward instructions. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often\u2014through libraries, schools, veterans\u2019 and faith groups, and other trusted local messengers\u2014to explain how safeguards work, correct misinformation with facts, and provide a clear, consistent way for citizens to raise concerns and see them addressed. When people can see how decisions are made, verify outcomes, and experience fair service, confidence becomes earned rather than demanded.",
