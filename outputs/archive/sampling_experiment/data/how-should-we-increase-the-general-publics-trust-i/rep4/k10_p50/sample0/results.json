Institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual language, publish timely evidence (audit summaries, error rates, and corrective actions), and invite bipartisan and community observers so oversight is real and visible. Finally, sustained civics education and trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, veterans\u2019 and faith groups, and community organizations\u2014can reduce misinformation and help people feel respected, heard, and confident that the system is accountable to the public rather than to any party.",

We should use auditable ballots (such as paper records), routine risk-limiting post-election audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and nonpartisan oversight that welcomes observers and publishes findings in plain language. Trust also depends on access and respect: reliable early and mail voting options, accessible polling places and accommodations for people with disabilities, and clear multilingual information so every eligible voter can participate confidently. Finally, consistent, timely communication, strong civics education, and community-based outreach through trusted local partners can reduce confusion and misinformation\u2014so confidence is earned through transparent performance, not partisan rhetoric.",
