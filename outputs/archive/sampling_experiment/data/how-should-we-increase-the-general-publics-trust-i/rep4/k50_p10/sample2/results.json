A strong middle-ground approach is to combine secure, auditable systems (paper records or equivalent voter-verifiable trails, strong chain-of-custody, modern cybersecurity, and routine independent risk-limiting audits) with transparent, timely public reporting that explains what was done and what was found. Participation should be genuinely accessible: clear plain-language and multilingual instructions, well-run polling locations, and reliable early and mail options with consistent standards. Oversight should be nonpartisan and community-facing\u2014bipartisan observers, open data where appropriate, and partnerships with trusted local organizations\u2014so concerns are heard and corrected without turning administration into political theater. Finally, ongoing civics education and rapid, evidence-based responses to misinformation can help people understand the process and hold institutions to their promises.",
