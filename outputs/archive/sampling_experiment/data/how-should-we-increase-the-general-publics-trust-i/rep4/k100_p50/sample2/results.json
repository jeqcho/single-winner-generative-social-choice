    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see clear rules, reliable performance, and real accountability\u2014especially when mistakes are acknowledged and fixed. A practical middle-ground approach is to make key processes transparent and verifiable (publicly documented procedures, auditable records, independent reviews, and plain-language reporting), while keeping access fair and workable for all eligible participants through convenient options and reasonable safeguards. Institutions should communicate early and often with consistent, nonpartisan facts; publish data and review findings in formats regular people can understand; and partner with trusted local messengers (libraries, schools, faith and civic groups) to answer questions and counter misinformation without lecturing. Finally, enforce strong ethics and anti-corruption standards, protect frontline workers, and create easy ways for the public to report problems and see them resolved\u2014so trust is earned through visible integrity, not slogans.",

That means using auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable backups), routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits), strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and transparent public reporting of audit results in plain language. Institutions should be overseen in a clearly nonpartisan way, with opportunities for bipartisan and community observation and timely correction of errors when they occur.\n\nTrust also depends on respectful, practical access: clear, consistent rules, well-trained and protected front-line workers, accessible polling locations, and secure options like early voting and mail voting with strong verification safeguards. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education and multilingual, local outreach through trusted community partners (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups) to reduce misinformation and help every eligible person understand how the system works\u2014so confidence is earned through visible integrity, not slogans.",
