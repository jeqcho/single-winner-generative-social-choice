A practical middle ground is to standardize transparent, auditable procedures: voter-verified paper records (or an equivalent independent record), routine risk-limiting post-election audits with publicly posted results, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and clear processes for handling errors and challenges. At the same time, participation should be straightforward and fair\u2014secure early and mail options where offered, accessible polling places, reasonable identity/eligibility checks that don\u2019t create undue barriers, and multilingual, plain-language information.

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy for ordinary people to verify, while treating everyone fairly and with respect. That means clear, consistent rules; strong security (including cybersecurity and secure chain-of-custody for ballots and records); and routine, independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results published quickly in plain language. Oversight should be nonpartisan and transparent, with room for bipartisan and community observers so people can see safeguards working without turning administration into political theater. At the same time, participation must remain practical and accessible: reliable in-person voting, early voting where feasible, secure mail options with tracking, accommodations for people with disabilities, and multilingual information so families who speak languages other than English can understand the process. Institutions earn trust when they communicate honestly about what happened, what went wrong (if anything), how it was fixed, and how concerns can be raised and resolved\u2014so confidence comes from evidence, not slogans.",
