    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, how money is spent, and what happens when leaders get things wrong. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity safeguards with broad, fair access: set clear rules, publish plain-language explanations and data, protect privacy, and invite independent oversight (audits, inspectors general, courts, journalists, and community observers) that can verify performance without partisan interference. Institutions should communicate early and often, admit mistakes, correct them publicly, and enforce real consequences for misconduct. Finally, invest in local, multilingual, and accessible public service\u2014so people experience competence and respect in everyday interactions\u2014and build durable channels for feedback, appeals, and community participation. Trust is earned through consistent, transparent results, not slogans.",

That means using verifiable records (like voter\u2011verified paper trails), strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity, and routine independent post\u2011election audits with results published promptly in plain language. Participation should be accessible to every eligible voter through reliable options (in\u2011person, early, and secure mail voting where offered), with accommodations for disability and language access so families can confidently take part. Where identification or eligibility checks are used, they should be applied consistently and fairly, with safeguards so eligible voters are not blocked. Finally, sustained civics education and nonpartisan, community-based outreach\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted local leaders\u2014should explain how the system works and address concerns with facts, reducing misinformation and strengthening confidence over time.",

We should make processes transparent and auditable (clear procedures, independent oversight, public reporting of results and performance, and routine audits with paper or other verifiable records where relevant), while protecting privacy and civil rights. Access and inclusion must be built in: plain-language explanations, multilingual information (including Spanish and other common community languages), disability accommodations, and practical options that reduce burdens for working families, rural residents, and seniors. Institutions should also communicate early and honestly\u2014what is known, what is not, and how concerns will be investigated\u2014while addressing misinformation with facts rather than partisan attacks. Finally, rebuilding trust requires consistent standards, well-trained and protected frontline staff, and regular community engagement through schools, libraries, faith groups, and local organizations so people feel respected and heard and can confidently rely on the system.",
