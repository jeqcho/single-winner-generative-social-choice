We should set transparent standards for how decisions are made and how money is spent; publish plain-language explanations and timely data; and create independent oversight with real power to audit, investigate, and correct errors. For elections, that means secure, auditable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine risk-limiting audits open to public observation, and consistent communication about what was checked and what was found. At the same time, institutions should reduce unnecessary barriers by making services accessible\u2014disability accommodations, language support, and practical voting options\u2014while enforcing fair eligibility rules and protecting privacy. Rebuilding trust also requires ongoing community engagement: local forums, schools and libraries as trusted messengers, and clear ways for residents to report problems and see them resolved. When institutions show their work, admit mistakes, and fix them transparently, confidence can be earned across political and cultural lines.",
