    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see that the rules are fair, the work is competently done, and mistakes are acknowledged and corrected. We should strengthen transparent, verifiable election administration by using paper-based records, routine independent risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and public reporting that is timely and easy to understand. Oversight should be nonpartisan and include meaningful opportunities for bipartisan and community observation, with consistent standards that protect both ballot access and election integrity. Just as important, institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual language, fund local offices so they can serve voters well, and invest in civic education and trusted community outreach to counter misinformation without silencing legitimate questions. When people experience respectful service, clear accountability, and verifiable results, confidence can be rebuilt across political lines.",

That means clear and consistently applied rules; secure, paper-based or paper-backed records; strict chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity; and routine, independent post-process audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results published quickly and plainly. Institutions should be overseen in a nonpartisan, accountable way, with transparent reporting and timely, factual updates that address errors openly and explain corrective steps. At the same time, trust grows when access is fair and practical for every eligible person: reliable polling places, safe early and mail options where used, disability accommodations, and clear multilingual information. Finally, ongoing civic education and local community outreach\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted community organizations\u2014can reduce confusion, counter misinformation, and help people feel confident that outcomes reflect the public\u2019s will.",
