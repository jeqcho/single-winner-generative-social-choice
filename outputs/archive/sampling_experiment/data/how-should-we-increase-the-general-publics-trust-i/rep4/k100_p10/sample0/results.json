    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can see\u2014clearly and without partisan spin\u2014that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and every eligible voter can participate. We should use auditable voting systems with a voter-verifiable paper record, routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and transparent public reporting of results and audit findings. At the same time, access should be protected through reliable polling options and consistent, well-communicated rules that prevent fraud without creating unnecessary barriers. Finally, election offices should communicate in plain language and multiple languages through trusted local institutions, correct errors quickly, and safeguard election workers so the public can trust both the process and the people running it.",

That means clear, consistent rules; independent, nonpartisan oversight; auditable records such as paper ballots where feasible; routine risk-limiting audits; and strong cybersecurity with prompt correction of errors when they occur. Trust also grows when access and security are balanced so every eligible person can participate without unnecessary barriers, and when institutions communicate plainly, publish timely evidence (including audit results), and provide multilingual, community-based education through trusted local partners like libraries, schools, and civic groups. By focusing on accountability, accessibility, and straightforward proof rather than partisan messaging, institutions can earn durable confidence across communities.",

Trust also depends on communication: publish timely results and audit findings, explain procedures in plain language, and provide information in the languages communities use at home, delivered through trusted local channels like schools, libraries, and community organizations. Finally, keep oversight independent and nonpartisan, with transparent standards and consistent rules where possible, so people can see evidence\u2014not political spin\u2014that institutions are doing their job.",
