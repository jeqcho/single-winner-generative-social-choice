    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity safeguards (auditable paper records, strict chain-of-custody, regular independent risk-limiting audits, and secure voter rolls) with broad, non-discriminatory access (reasonable early and mail options, accessible polling places, and accommodations for disability and language needs). Election administrators should publish timely, plain-language, multilingual explanations of how votes are cast, counted, and verified, openly report errors and fixes, and welcome bipartisan/community observation under uniform standards. By investing in well-trained local election offices and responding to misinformation with calm, evidence-based transparency\u2014not partisan messaging\u2014we can make confidence something the public earns through verifiable performance.",

Trust also grows when participation is practical and fair: clear, plain\u2011language guidance on registration and voting; accessible polling places and reasonable options like early voting and secure mail voting; and information available in multiple languages with accommodations for people with disabilities. Finally, officials and community partners (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups) should provide consistent, factual civics education and timely public explanations of results and audits to counter misinformation without partisan spin.

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easier for ordinary people to verify, while treating every community with equal respect. That means transparent, evidence-based rules; auditable records (such as voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent durable backups); routine, independent post-election audits with results published quickly in plain language; strong cybersecurity and clear chain-of-custody safeguards; and accountable oversight that includes bipartisan participation and space for nonpartisan community observers. Trust also depends on fair access and dignity: clear instructions, multilingual information where needed, reasonable accommodations for disability, reliable polling operations that reduce long lines, and consistent communication that corrects mistakes openly and counters misinformation without partisan spin. When institutions show their work, explain it clearly, and apply the same standards to everyone, confidence can be earned across political views and generations.",
