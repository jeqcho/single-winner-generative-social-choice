    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014rises when people can clearly see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and mistakes are openly found and fixed. A strong middle-ground approach is to standardize transparent, verifiable safeguards: auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), routine risk-limiting audits with publicly posted results, strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and clear procedures for resolving close counts or irregularities. At the same time, institutions should reduce needless barriers by ensuring convenient, accessible voting options (in-person, early, and mail where offered) with reliable tracking and reasonable identity/eligibility checks that protect both access and integrity. Finally, trust grows when communication is nonpartisan, plain-language, and multilingual, delivered through well-funded local offices and trusted community partners, with rapid, factual responses to misinformation and strong protections for election workers.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the system easy to understand, easy to verify, and fair to access. That means using auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper backups), enforcing strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and running routine independent, bipartisan risk-limiting audits with results published quickly in plain language. Institutions should also communicate consistently and nonpartisanly\u2014explaining rules, timelines, and how problems are fixed\u2014while investing in civic education and multilingual outreach so every community can see how the process works. Trust is earned when integrity measures are real and observable, access is practical for working families and people with disabilities, and accountability is transparent enough that ordinary residents can confirm the outcome without relying on partisan claims.",

We should treat election administration like critical public infrastructure: use auditable paper ballots or voter-verified records, strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent post-election risk-limiting audits with results published quickly in plain language. Access and integrity must go together: practical options like early voting, secure trackable mail ballots, accessible polling places, and reasonable voter identity and eligibility checks that prevent fraud without creating unfair barriers. Finally, institutions should earn confidence through respectful, local, nonpartisan communication\u2014multilingual where needed (including Spanish), open public observation, well-trained and protected election workers, and consistent civic education\u2014so people can see how decisions are made, how mistakes are corrected, and why the outcome is trustworthy.",
