That means using voter-verifiable paper records (or equivalent auditable records), enforcing strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and conducting routine, independent post-election audits with results published promptly in plain language. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan, with transparent rules applied consistently across jurisdictions, and with meaningful consequences when procedures aren\u2019t followed. At the same time, access should be practical and lawful\u2014reliable polling places, reasonable early voting options, and secure absentee or mail voting with tracking and clear ID/signature rules\u2014so participation isn\u2019t a privilege of those with time and resources. Finally, institutions must communicate early and often, in multiple languages, with open data where appropriate and rapid correction of misinformation, so people can see not just who won, but how the outcome was verified.",

Just as important, we should expand lawful access\u2014well-run polling places, early voting, and secure mail options where used\u2014while providing plain-language, multilingual explanations and nonpartisan voter education through trusted community channels to reduce confusion and counter misinformation.

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few standards everyone can see and verify: clear rules applied consistently, transparent decision-making, and real accountability when mistakes happen. For elections, that means auditable paper ballots (or an auditable paper record), secure chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results published promptly in plain language. Oversight should be nonpartisan and open to bipartisan observers, with clear guardrails so officials can do their jobs without political pressure.\n\nTrust also depends on fair access and respectful communication. Institutions should invest in well-funded local offices, trained staff, and customer-service-level responsiveness\u2014shorter lines, accessible polling locations, reliable early voting and secure mail voting with tracking\u2014so working families, seniors, rural residents, and voters with disabilities can participate without confusion. Public information should be easy to understand and available in the languages people actually use at home (including Spanish and other community languages), and schools, libraries, and trusted community groups should be supported in providing nonpartisan civic and voter education.\n\nFinally, institutions earn trust by being honest about what they can and can\u2019t do, releasing data and reasoning whenever possible, correcting errors quickly, and enforcing rules evenly\u2014so every community can see that the system is both secure and fair, and that every eligible citizen\u2019s voice is counted with dignity.",
