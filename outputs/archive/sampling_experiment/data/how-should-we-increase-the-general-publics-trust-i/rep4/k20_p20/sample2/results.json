    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are followed, and feel they are treated fairly regardless of party, background, or zip code. We should strengthen transparency (open meetings, clear public reporting, and independent audits), accountability (enforceable ethics rules, conflict-of-interest disclosures, and consequences for misconduct), and service quality (simple, multilingual communication; accessible processes; and timely, reliable delivery of core services). Institutions should invite meaningful public oversight\u2014community advisory panels, bipartisan/nonpartisan review where appropriate, and easy ways to submit questions and get factual answers\u2014while protecting privacy and security. By pairing clear standards with consistent enforcement and respectful, plain-language communication, we can reduce misinformation, correct mistakes quickly, and rebuild confidence that institutions exist to serve the public, not partisan interests.",

Institutions should communicate rules and results in clear, plain language, provide multilingual and accessible information, and respond quickly and calmly to errors and misinformation with evidence.\n\nTrust also grows when oversight is nonpartisan and accountable: empower well-trained local officials, allow bipartisan/independent observers, and publish transparent performance metrics and corrective actions.

Access should be reliable and fair: convenient in-person voting, early and mail options with tracking, accessible polling places and ballot design, and reasonable identity and eligibility protections that prevent fraud without blocking eligible voters. Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, share timelines for results, correct errors transparently, and respond quickly and calmly to misinformation. Finally, trust grows locally\u2014by empowering nonpartisan election administrators and inviting bipartisan observers and trusted community messengers (schools, veterans, faith and civic groups) to help educate the public so families, workers, seniors, and first-time voters all feel their voices count.",
