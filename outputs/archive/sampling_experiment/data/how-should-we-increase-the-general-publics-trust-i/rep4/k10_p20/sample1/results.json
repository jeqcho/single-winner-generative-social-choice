    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in elections, we should make the system both easier to verify and easier to use\u2014without favoring any party. That means requiring voting methods that produce a voter-verified record (such as paper ballots or equivalent), conducting routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible), and enforcing strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards with clear, consistent rules that are applied the same way to everyone. At the same time, states should ensure real access for eligible voters through well-staffed polling places, reasonable early voting options, secure and trackable mail voting where offered, and accommodations for voters with disabilities. Trust also depends on communication: election offices should publish plain-language, multilingual explanations of procedures and results, quickly correct mistakes, protect election workers, and invite bipartisan and community observation under fair, uniform guidelines. When people can see how votes are protected, counted, checked, and explained\u2014and can participate without unnecessary barriers\u2014confidence in the outcome grows.",
