    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can both participate easily and verify that rules are followed fairly. A durable middle ground is to pair broad access (convenient in-person options, secure absentee/mail voting with tracking, disability accommodations, and language support) with strong, visible integrity measures (auditable paper records, strict chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight). Institutions should publish timely, plain-language explanations of procedures, results, and any errors with clear corrective steps, and invite independent observers and community partners to help communicate facts without partisan spin. By making decisions and data transparent, protecting frontline workers, and holding leaders accountable for honesty and performance, trust can be earned through consistent, understandable evidence\u2014not rhetoric.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus less on rhetoric and more on visible, verifiable performance that people from every community can understand and check for themselves. That means clear, consistent rules; secure, auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verified paper trails); strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine independent audits (including risk-limiting audits) with results published quickly in plain language.\n\nTrust also depends on fair, practical access: reliable polling places, reasonable options like early voting and secure vote-by-mail with tracking, accommodations for disabilities, and accurate information in the languages people use at home. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and locally accountable, with bipartisan observers and transparent public reporting so mistakes are acknowledged and corrected without spin.\n\nFinally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education and trusted community messengers\u2014schools, libraries, faith groups, veterans\u2019 and immigrant organizations\u2014so families and young people can learn how systems work, how concerns are handled, and why the safeguards are there. When people can see the rules, see the checks, and see respectful treatment for every eligible voter, confidence is earned and sustained.",
