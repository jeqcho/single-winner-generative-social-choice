    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is rebuilt when people can see how decisions are made, how money is spent, and what happens when mistakes occur\u2014without needing to be an insider. A practical middle ground is to pair stronger transparency and accountability (clear standards, open data where privacy allows, independent audits/inspector-general reviews, and public reporting of performance) with stronger fairness and access (consistent rules, plain-language explanations, multilingual communication, and simple ways for residents to ask questions and get timely answers). Institutions should also commit to integrity safeguards that work across political lines: enforce conflicts-of-interest rules, protect whistleblowers, separate technical administration from partisan pressure, and publish concrete corrective-action plans when problems are found. Finally, building trust requires ongoing civic partnerships\u2014schools, libraries, faith and community groups\u2014so people receive reliable information, can spot misinformation, and have real opportunities to participate in shaping policies that affect their lives.",

At the same time, we should protect both security and access by funding professional, nonpartisan local election offices; keeping polling places safe; offering practical options like early voting and secure mail voting with clear safeguards; and ensuring disability and language access. Finally, institutions should counter misinformation by communicating promptly about procedures, mistakes, and fixes\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted community partners\u2014so citizens feel informed, respected, and confident that every eligible vote is counted accurately.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make core processes easy for everyday people to see, understand, and verify, while protecting rights and ensuring equal access. That means transparent procedures with a clear chain of custody, voter\u2011verified records (such as paper ballots or equivalent), routine independent audits (including risk\u2011limiting audits), and public reports written in plain language and available in multiple languages. Institutions should be run by trained, nonpartisan professionals with bipartisan and community oversight, consistent standards, strong cybersecurity, and clear accountability when mistakes happen\u2014explaining what occurred, how it was fixed, and how it will be prevented. At the same time, we should invest in civics and media\u2011literacy education through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations, and maintain accessible, safe participation options (reasonable hours, disability accommodations, and secure early/mail voting where allowed) so people can experience institutions as fair, competent, and respectful. Trust is earned when transparency is routine, information is honest and timely, and people can verify outcomes without needing partisan sources.",
