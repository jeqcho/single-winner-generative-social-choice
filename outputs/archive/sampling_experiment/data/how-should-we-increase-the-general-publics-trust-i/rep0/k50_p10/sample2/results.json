    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when they are open about how decisions are made, consistently follow fair rules, and invite the public to verify performance rather than simply asking for confidence. A practical middle ground is to set clear, nonpartisan standards; publish plain-language explanations of procedures and budgets; and use independent oversight with routine public reporting and audits where appropriate. Institutions should actively engage communities through locally trusted messengers, accessible services, and meaningful feedback channels, while protecting staff and participants from intimidation. Finally, leaders must address mistakes quickly\u2014owning errors, correcting them transparently, and enforcing accountability\u2014so people can see that integrity is built into the system, not dependent on politics or personalities.",

That means professional, nonpartisan administration with bipartisan/public oversight; strong security (including cyber protections and strict chain-of-custody); and verifiable records such as voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent auditable paper trails, paired with routine independent risk-limiting audits whose results are published promptly in plain language. Trust also grows when access is practical for everyone\u2014safe in-person voting, reliable vote-by-mail where offered, accessible polling sites, and reasonable accommodations for seniors, working families, rural voters, and language-minority communities. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often with straightforward explanations, open data where appropriate, and community-based civic education, while correcting misinformation with evidence rather than rhetoric. When people can understand the process, verify outcomes, and see fair treatment across communities, confidence in institutions rises.",
