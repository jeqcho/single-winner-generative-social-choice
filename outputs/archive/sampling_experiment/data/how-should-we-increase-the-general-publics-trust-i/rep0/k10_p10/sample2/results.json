    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the rules are clear, the process is easy to observe and verify, and officials are accountable regardless of party. A strong middle-ground approach is to maintain a voter-verifiable paper record for every ballot, conduct routine independent risk-limiting audits with publicly posted methods and results, and set baseline national standards while preserving local administration and flexibility. Elections should also be accessible\u2014reasonable polling hours, secure and trackable mail/early voting options, and well-funded local election offices\u2014so participation doesn\u2019t depend on time, language, or disability. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often in plain, multilingual language: what safeguards exist, what went wrong if problems occur, and how they were fixed, while partnering with trusted community organizations and media to counter misinformation with evidence rather than rhetoric.",

We should strengthen transparency and accountability through voter-verified paper records (or an equivalent durable paper trail), routine independent risk-limiting audits with results published promptly, and clear, consistent standards that are applied the same way across jurisdictions while preserving local operational flexibility. Trust also depends on practical accessibility: well-resourced polling places, secure and reliable early and mail options where offered, and processes that respect voters\u2019 time and privacy. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often in plain, nonpartisan language\u2014multilingual where needed\u2014so the public understands how decisions are made, how problems are handled, and how misinformation is addressed with evidence. Investing in trained, professional staff and open oversight that welcomes bipartisan and community observation helps prove integrity at every step.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on making processes easy to understand, independently verifiable, and consistently applied, while treating people\u2019s time, rights, and privacy with respect. That means: (1) transparency by default, with clear plain-language (and multilingual) explanations of how decisions are made, how results are counted, and what safeguards exist; (2) verification people can check, such as voter-verified paper records where relevant, routine independent audits (including risk-limiting audits), and prompt publication of methods and results; (3) accountable oversight that is genuinely nonpartisan and includes local community observers, with strong protections for frontline officials from political pressure; (4) strong security and privacy practices, including cybersecurity investments, incident reporting, and regular third-party testing; and (5) practical accessibility\u2014reasonable hours, clear instructions, and reliable customer-service style support\u2014so participation doesn\u2019t feel confusing or burdensome. Trust grows when institutions communicate early and honestly (including about mistakes), invite scrutiny, and prove through repeatable evidence that the same fair rules apply to everyone.",
