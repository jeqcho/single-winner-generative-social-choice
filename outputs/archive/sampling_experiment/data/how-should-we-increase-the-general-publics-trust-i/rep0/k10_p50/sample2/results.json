    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, confirm that rules are applied fairly, and count on consequences when standards aren\u2019t met. We should strengthen transparency with clear public reporting, independent oversight, and routine audits where appropriate; improve accessibility by communicating in plain language and multiple languages and offering easy ways for residents to ask questions and get timely answers; and reinforce integrity through strong ethics rules, protections for whistleblowers, and consistent enforcement against corruption, intimidation, and deliberate misinformation. At the same time, institutions should invest in local, community-partnered civic education and regular public forums so policies are shaped with input from the people they affect. When institutions are open about how they work, admit mistakes, fix problems quickly, and treat everyone with dignity, trust can be rebuilt across political and cultural lines.",

That means setting clear, consistent rules; using independent, nonpartisan oversight and regular audits; and publishing plain-language, timely explanations of what was done, why it was done, what safeguards exist, and how problems are investigated and fixed. Institutions should protect privacy and security (including strong cyber protections), ensure equal and practical access to services, and invest in ongoing civics and public education through trusted local partners like schools, libraries, and community organizations. When transparency, accountability, and accessibility are built into daily operations\u2014not just promised during crises\u2014people are more likely to believe the system is working for them rather than for a party or special interest.",

We should set clear, consistent standards for core public functions (like elections, public health, education, and infrastructure), require independent oversight and routine audits with plain-language public reports, and make key data and processes transparent while protecting privacy and security. Institutions also need to invest in well-trained frontline staff, strong cybersecurity and records management, and dependable customer-service style communication: timely updates, straightforward explanations, and clear paths to ask questions and resolve errors. Finally, sustained civic education and partnerships with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, community organizations, and faith groups\u2014can help counter misinformation and rebuild confidence through repeated, visible proof that institutions work for everyone.",
