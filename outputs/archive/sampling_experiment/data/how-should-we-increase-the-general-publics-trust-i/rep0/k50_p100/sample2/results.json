    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see, verify, and understand how decisions are made and how problems are fixed. We should set clear, consistently applied rules; protect both security and access; and back key outcomes with independent oversight, auditable records, and routine public reporting that is written in plain language and available in multiple languages. Institutions should publish performance measures (what worked, what didn\u2019t, and what changed), investigate credible complaints quickly and transparently, and enforce meaningful consequences for fraud, intimidation, and deliberate disinformation\u2014while protecting free speech and due process. Finally, sustained civics and media literacy education, paired with respectful community outreach through schools, libraries, local groups, and faith communities, can help people engage with facts, ask questions, and regain confidence that the system serves everyone fairly.",
