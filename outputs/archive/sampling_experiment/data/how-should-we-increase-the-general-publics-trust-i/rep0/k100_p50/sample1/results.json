    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, how money is spent, and how mistakes are corrected\u2014regardless of politics. Institutions should set clear, consistent rules; publish understandable data and performance measures; invite independent oversight and regular audits; and hold leaders accountable with real consequences for misconduct. They should communicate early and plainly, correct errors quickly, protect privacy and civil rights, and ensure services are accessible and responsive to all communities through multilingual outreach and local partnerships. By combining transparency, fairness, competence, and respectful public engagement, institutions can earn trust through demonstrated results rather than slogans.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and independently verify how decisions are made\u2014especially in elections. We should standardize clear, nonpartisan rules; use secure, voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent audit trails); protect chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and require routine, independent post-process audits with results published promptly in plain language. Oversight should be bipartisan and professionally administered, with real access for authorized observers and strong protections against intimidation, fraud, and misinformation. At the same time, participation must be practical and fair: accessible polling locations, reasonable hours, disability accommodations, and accurate information in multiple languages, paired with ongoing civics and media-literacy education through schools and trusted local community spaces. When institutions communicate transparently about problems, fixes, and safeguards\u2014and make it easy for the public to verify outcomes\u2014confidence can be rebuilt across differences.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on practices people can independently verify, rules that are applied consistently, and communication that is clear and respectful.\n\nThat means transparent procedures with real checks and balances: verifiable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable audit trails), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine independent post\u2011event audits, and meaningful bipartisan and public observation with published results in plain language. It also means accountability when mistakes happen\u2014promptly explaining what occurred, what was fixed, and what will prevent repeats.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions serve people fairly in everyday life: accessible services and polling locations, reasonable hours, accommodations for disabilities, and multilingual information so families can understand the process without needing insider knowledge. Finally, sustained civics education and media literacy\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted local community organizations\u2014can help people recognize misinformation, ask informed questions, and feel confident that institutions earn trust through openness, competence, and equal treatment.",
