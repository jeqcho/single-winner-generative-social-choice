    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, check that rules are followed, and observe that leaders are held accountable when they are not. A practical middle ground is to make processes transparent and verifiable (clear standards, independent oversight, public reporting, and regular audits), while also protecting privacy and security. Institutions should communicate in plain language, publish timely explanations when problems occur, and make data and procedures accessible so non-experts can understand what happened and why. Trust also increases when services are delivered fairly and consistently\u2014reducing corruption and conflicts of interest, ensuring equal access, and creating meaningful ways for communities to give feedback and shape improvements. Finally, sustained civic education and partnerships with trusted local organizations can help counter misinformation without partisan messaging, reinforcing that institutions serve the public rather than a side.",

Clear, plain\u2011language public reporting\u2014before, during, and after Election Day\u2014should explain how ballots are counted, what safeguards exist, and how any problems are identified and corrected. At the same time, we should expand accessible voting options and provide reliable, multilingual voter information and civics education through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, community groups) to reduce confusion and misinformation.

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in key institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared, practical standards: make decisions and results transparent, make them verifiable, and explain them clearly in plain language. That means using systems that leave an auditable record (such as paper backups where appropriate), routine independent audits with publicly posted results, strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections, and consistent baseline standards so people don\u2019t feel the rules change from place to place. Trust also grows when access is protected\u2014safe in-person voting, secure absentee or mail options, disability accommodations, and multilingual information\u2014so every eligible person can participate without barriers. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often through trusted local messengers (schools, libraries, community organizations), share open data where feasible, and correct misinformation with calm, evidence-based updates\u2014while holding administrators accountable through nonpartisan oversight and clear consequences for misconduct. When people can see how decisions are made, check that the process is fair, and feel respected as participants, confidence follows.",
