A practical middle ground is to use voter-verified paper ballots (or paper backups), maintain strong cybersecurity, and require routine, independent post-election audits with public, plain-language reports that explain what was checked and what was found. Election administration should be professional and nonpartisan, with clear statewide standards, bipartisan observation, and transparent chain-of-custody procedures so the public can see how ballots are protected and counted. At the same time, we should expand access in ways that keep safeguards\u2014reliable early voting options, well-run in-person polling, and mail voting with identity verification that is secure but not burdensome\u2014along with accessible accommodations and multilingual help. Finally, sustained civic education, proactive myth-busting, and partnerships with trusted local institutions (libraries, schools, veterans groups, faith and community organizations) can help people understand the system, spot misinformation, and feel confident that the outcome reflects the voters\u2019 will.",

That means keeping nonpartisan, professional administration; using voter-verifiable paper records where possible; conducting routine independent audits with public, plain-language reporting of what was checked and what was found; and maintaining strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections. At the same time, institutions should make participation practical and inclusive through well-run polling places, reasonable early and mail voting options with transparent safeguards, and accessible, multilingual information for people with disabilities and for families who do not speak English at home.
