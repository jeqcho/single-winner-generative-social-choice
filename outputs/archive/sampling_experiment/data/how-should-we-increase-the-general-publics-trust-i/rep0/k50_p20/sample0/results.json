    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections increases when institutions prove\u2014consistently and in public\u2014that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and every eligible voter can participate without intimidation. A practical middle ground is to standardize clear, enforceable baseline procedures across jurisdictions: secure voter registration and up-to-date rolls, transparent ballot handling with documented chain-of-custody, a voter-verifiable paper record, and routine post-election audits with results published in plain language. Oversight should be genuinely bipartisan and include qualified independent observers, with strong protections for poll workers and meaningful penalties for interference or threats. At the same time, institutions should communicate early and often\u2014using accessible, multilingual information, open data, and straightforward explanations of delays or irregularities\u2014so people understand what happened and why. When the public can verify outcomes, see accountability, and experience elections as both secure and convenient, trust becomes earned rather than assumed.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear, consistently applied rules and proof that systems work as promised. We should use transparent, nonpartisan administration with a verifiable paper record (or equivalent backup), secure chain-of-custody, routine independent risk-limiting audits, and public reporting that explains results and any issues in plain language. Participation should be straightforward and accessible for every eligible voter through well-run polling places and practical options like early voting and secure vote-by-mail, supported by multilingual information. At the same time, safeguards should be fair and evenhanded\u2014accurate voter rolls, meaningful bipartisan/independent observation, strong cybersecurity, and protections against intimidation or interference\u2014so integrity and access reinforce each other. Finally, sustained civics and media literacy education and proactive communication can reduce misinformation and help the public understand, verify, and accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few principles that people across backgrounds can verify for themselves: transparency, consistent rules, accountability, and equal access.\n\nThat means institutions should show their work: publish clear, plain-language explanations of how decisions are made; release timely, easy-to-find data and reports; and invite independent, cross-partisan and community oversight. For elections specifically, trust is strengthened by verifiable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine independent post-election audits with publicly reported results, and clear explanations of counting and certification.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions are responsive and fair in everyday life\u2014making services accessible (including for people with disabilities and different language needs), protecting rights, enforcing rules consistently, and creating simple ways for the public to ask questions, report problems, and get prompt, documented answers. Finally, investing in civics education and media literacy\u2014through schools, libraries, and community groups\u2014helps people understand how institutions work and spot misinformation.\n\nWhen institutions are open, consistently applied, independently checked, and easy for ordinary people to understand and use, confidence can be earned and sustained\u2014even when outcomes are disappointing to some.",
