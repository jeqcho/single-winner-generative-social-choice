Institutions should publish clear standards, budgets, and performance metrics in plain language; use independent oversight and regular audits; and make data and records accessible while protecting privacy and security. Just as important, leaders should engage communities early\u2014through local forums, multilingual communication, and partnerships with trusted civic groups\u2014so feedback changes outcomes, mistakes are acknowledged quickly, and corrections are tracked publicly. By combining strong safeguards against fraud and abuse with simple, predictable processes and respectful two-way communication, institutions can earn confidence across political and cultural lines.",
