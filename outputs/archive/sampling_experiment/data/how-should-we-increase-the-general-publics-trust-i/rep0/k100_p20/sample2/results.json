    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is strengthened when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and get clear answers when something goes wrong. We should set consistent, publicly documented standards for transparency, ethics, and performance; publish plain-language reports and open data where possible; and require independent oversight such as audits, inspector generals, and community review boards with real authority. Institutions should protect privacy and security, enforce consequences for misconduct regardless of status or party, and create easy, responsive ways for the public to ask questions, appeal decisions, and report concerns without retaliation. Finally, sustained civic education and local partnerships\u2014schools, libraries, faith groups, and community organizations\u2014can help people understand how institutions work and ensure that services and leadership reflect the communities they serve.",

We should use secure voting systems with a voter-verifiable paper record, strict chain-of-custody, and routine independent risk-limiting audits whose findings are published promptly in plain language. Transparent, bipartisan (or otherwise nonpartisan) oversight and real public access for observers should be paired with strong cybersecurity and rapid, fact-based responses to problems or misinformation. At the same time, trust depends on broad, barrier-free participation: clear voter education, language access, convenient options like early voting and mail-in where secure, and protections against intimidation or political interference\u2014so every eligible citizen can vote confidently and know their ballot was counted accurately.",

That means clear, consistent rules; transparent reporting of what was done and why; independent oversight and routine audits; and real consequences for misconduct. Institutions should communicate in plain language, publish data and performance measures where privacy allows, and correct mistakes quickly and publicly. Trust also grows when services feel fair and accessible: strong customer-service standards, language access, responsive local offices, and open channels for community input. Finally, we should invest in practical civic education and media literacy so people can tell the difference between evidence, rumor, and manipulation, while protecting free expression and encouraging respectful disagreement.",
