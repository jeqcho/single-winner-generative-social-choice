    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, how mistakes are caught, and how leaders are held accountable\u2014regardless of party or ideology. We should set clear, consistent standards for transparency (plain-language explanations, open data where privacy allows, and regular public reporting), independent oversight with real enforcement power, and strong ethics rules that reduce conflicts of interest. At the same time, institutions must deliver reliable, fair service: invest in competent staffing, secure modern systems, and simple, accessible ways for the public to participate, ask questions, and appeal decisions. Finally, trust is strengthened when institutions communicate early and honestly during problems, correct errors publicly, and partner with trusted local organizations to expand civic education and counter misinformation without silencing legitimate concerns.",

That includes nonpartisan administration; voter\u2011verified paper records (or equivalent auditable trails); routine, independent post\u2011election audits such as risk\u2011limiting audits; strong cybersecurity and chain\u2011of\u2011custody protections; and clear public reporting of results and how any issues are investigated and corrected. Trust also grows when participation is genuinely accessible: plain\u2011language and multilingual information, accommodations for disabilities, welcoming polling places, and practical options like early voting, mail voting with clear safeguards, and reliable in\u2011person hours. Finally, sustained civic education and community outreach through trusted local organizations (like libraries, schools, and community groups), paired with rapid, fact\u2011based responses to misinformation, can help people see how decisions are made, how accountability works, and why the system is fair even when outcomes disappoint them.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared, practical basics: make decisions and results easy to verify, explain them in plain language, and treat everyone fairly. For elections, that means nonpartisan administration, a voter-verifiable paper record (or an auditable paper-backed trail), routine independent post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits), strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity, and timely public reporting that shows what was checked and what was found. Trust also grows when participation is genuinely accessible: reliable in\u2011person voting, early and weekend hours, secure mail options where used, accommodations for disabilities, and clear multilingual information so all eligible voters can understand the process without giving up privacy. Finally, institutions should invest in local, trusted messengers\u2014libraries, schools, veterans\u2019 groups, community and tribal organizations\u2014and commit to transparent correction when mistakes happen, so people see accountability in action rather than politics or spin.",
