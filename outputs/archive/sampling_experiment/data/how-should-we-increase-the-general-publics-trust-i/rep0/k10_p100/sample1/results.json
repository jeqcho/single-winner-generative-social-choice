    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when rules are clear, performance is measurable, and leaders are accountable in ways the public can see. A practical middle ground is to (1) set consistent, publicly posted standards for core procedures while keeping local administration, (2) use verifiable records and routine independent audits with plain-language public reports, (3) protect access and integrity together through secure registration and ballot handling, appropriate identity and eligibility checks that don\u2019t create undue barriers, and strong protections against intimidation, and (4) communicate early and often with timely updates, open data where feasible, and transparent investigations and corrections when problems occur. Investing in civic education and media literacy\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted community partners\u2014helps people understand the safeguards and distinguish facts from rumors. When institutions make it easy to verify what happened, admit and fix mistakes, and treat every eligible person with dignity, confidence can be earned across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the rules and results easy to verify, consistently applied, and clearly explained. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or an auditable paper trail); strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections; and routine independent risk-limiting audits with plain-language public reports of what was checked, what was found, and how issues were fixed. Trust also grows when access is reliable and respectful\u2014safe, well-run polling places; reasonable hours and options like early voting and secure mail where appropriate; strong accommodations for disabilities; and clear multilingual information so every eligible voter can understand the process. Finally, we should invest in practical civics and media-literacy education through schools, libraries, and community organizations, and commit election officials to timely, calm, factual communication so people see the system working, not just hear competing claims.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the process verifiable, and the communication honest and easy to understand. That means using systems with a dependable paper record (or equivalent voter-verified backup), strict chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits) whose results are published promptly in plain language. Oversight should be nonpartisan and transparent, with meaningful access for bipartisan observers and clear procedures for reporting, investigating, and correcting problems.\n\nTrust also depends on respect and inclusion. Institutions should expand accessible options (early voting, secure mail voting where used, convenient hours, safe and well-run polling sites), provide disability accommodations, and offer multilingual information and help lines so working families, seniors, and communities that speak languages other than English can participate confidently. Finally, we should invest in practical civics and media-literacy education through schools, libraries, and community groups, and hold officials and influential voices accountable for knowingly spreading false claims. When people can see how decisions are made, verify the safeguards, and get straightforward answers, confidence grows\u2014even when outcomes are disappointing.",
