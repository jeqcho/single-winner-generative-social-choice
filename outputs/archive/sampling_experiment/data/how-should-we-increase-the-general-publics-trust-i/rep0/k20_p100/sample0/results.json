    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is earned when they are transparent, accountable, and consistently fair in ways people can see for themselves. We should open up decision-making and performance data (budgets, audits, outcomes, and error rates) in plain language, make independent oversight routine, and require clear explanations of what went wrong and how it was fixed when mistakes happen. Institutions also need to treat people with dignity by delivering services reliably, protecting privacy, enforcing rules evenly, and providing accessible ways to ask questions, appeal decisions, and get timely responses. Finally, investing in civic and media literacy\u2014and partnering with trusted local organizations to share accurate, nonpartisan information\u2014can reduce misinformation and help communities evaluate institutions based on evidence rather than rumors or partisan spin.",

Finally, we should invest in year-round civics and media-literacy education and provide multilingual, easy-to-read information through schools, libraries, and trusted local groups so people can distinguish facts from rumors and feel confident that institutions are accountable to everyone\u2014not any party or special interest.",
