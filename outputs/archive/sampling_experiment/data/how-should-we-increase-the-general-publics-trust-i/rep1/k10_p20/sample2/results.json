    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see clear rules being followed, problems being acknowledged, and results being checked by more than one set of eyes. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, verifiable safeguards (auditable records, routine independent reviews, clear chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and transparent reporting of errors and fixes) with fair, straightforward access and respectful treatment for every person (reasonable hours and options, accommodations for disabilities, and multilingual information). Institutions should publish plain-language explanations of how decisions are made, open their data and performance metrics where privacy allows, and create regular channels for local community feedback and oversight that are nonpartisan and representative. When accountability is visible, information is easy to understand, and leaders communicate promptly and honestly\u2014especially when something goes wrong\u2014confidence can rebuild across political and cultural lines.",

We should standardize core safeguards and transparency practices: voter-verifiable paper records (or equivalent auditable trails), routine risk-limiting post-election audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and independent bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with public reporting of findings and incidents. At the same time, trust requires real accessibility and dignity for every community: clear plain-language explanations of how decisions are made and results are verified; multilingual, disability-accessible materials and polling options; and practical access like early voting or well-secured vote-by-mail where appropriate. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, community groups) and rapid, factual communication to counter misinformation, so people understand not just what happened, but how it was checked and improved.",
