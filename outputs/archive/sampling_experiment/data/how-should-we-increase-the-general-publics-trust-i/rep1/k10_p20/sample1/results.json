    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, verify, and fairly access how decisions are made and how results are produced. A workable middle ground is to combine strong security with broad participation: use auditable paper records or equivalent verifiable trails, conduct routine independent post-election audits with publicly posted methods and findings, protect systems with modern cybersecurity and clear chain-of-custody rules, and apply voting procedures consistently and predictably so changes aren\u2019t made at the last minute. At the same time, keep options practical for real life (safe in-person voting, early voting where feasible, and secure, trackable mail or absentee voting) and ensure accessibility for seniors, people with disabilities, and voters who need language assistance. Trust also depends on communication\u2014plain-language explanations of how counting works, what safeguards exist, why results can take time, and transparent channels to report and fix problems\u2014delivered through credible local messengers across the political spectrum. Finally, institutions should earn confidence by holding themselves accountable when errors occur, publishing performance metrics, and enforcing clear consequences for wrongdoing, so trust is built on evidence rather than partisan claims.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, verify, and understand that the rules are fair, consistent, and followed the same way for everyone. That means transparent procedures from start to finish: secure, auditable paper-based records; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; routine, independent post-election risk\u2011limiting audits with timely public reporting; and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight that is open to public observation. Trust also depends on access and clarity, so voting options should be reliable and convenient for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and diverse communities, paired with plain\u2011language, multilingual information about how ballots are cast, processed, and counted. Finally, institutions should actively counter misinformation by publishing verifiable facts and data, partnering with trusted local organizations, and expanding civic education and opportunities for neighbors to serve (e.g., as poll workers), so confidence is built through both evidence and firsthand community involvement.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared, practical commitments: make decisions and results verifiable, explain them in plain language, and treat people fairly and consistently. That means using auditable records (like paper ballots or equivalent verifiable trails), routine independent post-election audits with publicly posted findings, strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections, and clear timelines so people understand why counting can take time. It also means rules that are simple and applied consistently, with transparency about any changes and who approved them.\n\nTrust grows when institutions are accessible and accountable to real life: convenient and secure voting options for working families, seniors, and people with disabilities; language access and bilingual outreach (including Spanish) through trusted local partners like schools, libraries, community groups, and faith organizations; and more opportunities for regular residents to serve as poll workers or observers so communities can see the process up close.\n\nFinally, institutions should earn credibility by communicating early and often\u2014sharing data, explaining safeguards, correcting errors openly, and countering misinformation with nonpartisan, evidence-based information\u2014so people across backgrounds can check the facts, understand the process, and feel confident that every eligible voice is counted.",
