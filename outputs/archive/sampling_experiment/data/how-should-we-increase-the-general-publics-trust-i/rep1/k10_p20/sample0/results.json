    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify outcomes, and feel they are treated fairly regardless of party, background, or zip code. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, visible integrity measures (auditable paper records, routine independent post\u2011election audits, secure chain\u2011of\u2011custody, and transparent public reporting) with broad, well-run access (reasonable early and absentee options, accessible polling places, and clear accommodations). Institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual language, publish simple \u201chow it works\u201d guides and local-level results data, invite bipartisan and community observation, and respond to mistakes with timely corrections and accountability. Investing in well-trained local administrators, cybersecurity, and year-round civic and media literacy education can reduce misinformation and help people judge claims based on evidence instead of rumors.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in elections, we should make the system visibly transparent, secure, and accessible\u2014so people of all political views can understand and independently verify the outcome. That means nonpartisan election administration; verifiable paper ballots (or paper-backed records); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine, publicly reported risk-limiting audits with bipartisan/independent oversight. Trust also grows when election offices communicate calmly and consistently in plain language\u2014using easy-to-read county-level reporting and public dashboards\u2014while providing multilingual information, disability access, and convenient voting options that do not compromise integrity. Finally, investing in civics and media literacy, welcoming responsible citizen observers, and protecting voters and workers from intimidation and partisan interference can help communities see elections as a shared civic duty rather than a partisan fight.",

That means nonpartisan, professional administration; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; auditable paper records; routine independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits); and clear, plain-language public reporting down to the local level so people can see how conclusions were reached. Trust also grows when institutions communicate quickly and honestly about what went right and what went wrong, correct mistakes publicly, and invite bipartisan and community observation without intimidation or partisan interference. Finally, invest in practical civic education and media literacy, plus multilingual and disability-accessible information and services, so all communities can understand the process and participate with confidence.",
