    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real consequences for mistakes or misconduct. A practical middle ground is to set baseline standards that every jurisdiction can meet: a voter-verifiable paper record for every ballot, secure chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits open to public observation, and transparent reporting that explains what happened, what went wrong (if anything), and how it was fixed. At the same time, access should be protected through multiple safe ways to vote (well-run in-person options, early voting where feasible, and secure mail voting where offered), plus disability accommodations and multilingual, plain-language information that reaches people through trusted local messengers. Finally, leaders, media, and election offices should commit to accuracy over speed\u2014sharing evidence-based updates, correcting misinformation quickly, and treating election administration as a nonpartisan public service\u2014so confidence is built by verifiable facts rather than partisan trust.",

We should use auditable paper ballots or equivalent voter-verifiable records, conduct routine independent risk-limiting audits, and publish clear public reports on results, chain-of-custody, cybersecurity protections, and how any errors are detected and fixed. Trust also improves when voting is convenient and fair\u2014through well-run polling places, secure early and mail voting options, and accommodations for disabilities\u2014paired with plain-language, multilingual communication that explains how the system works and counters misinformation with timely facts. Finally, consistent rules, bipartisan/independent oversight, and more opportunities for community members to observe or serve as poll workers can make integrity visible, so confidence comes from evidence and lived experience, not partisan claims.",

A strong approach is: (1) radical transparency and independent oversight\u2014publish clear standards, data, and timelines; use auditable records (e.g., paper ballots or equivalent verifiable trails), routine risk-limiting audits, and strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and release audit findings in plain language; (2) equal, practical access\u2014reliable in-person voting, early and mail options with strong safeguards, disability accommodations, and multilingual materials so busy working families, seniors, and language-minority communities can participate confidently; (3) accountability and professionalism\u2014nonpartisan administration, consistent training, clear consequences for interference or negligence, and honest public explanations when errors occur and how they were fixed; and (4) public-facing education and two-way engagement\u2014trusted local messengers (schools, community groups, faith leaders, employers) and straightforward resources that debunk misinformation without shaming people. When institutions pair verifiable procedures with respectful communication and real accountability, trust can be earned across political, cultural, and generational lines.",
