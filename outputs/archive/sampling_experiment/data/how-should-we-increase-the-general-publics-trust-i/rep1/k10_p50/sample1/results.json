    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and experience respectful, competent service in their daily lives. A practical middle ground is to pair stronger transparency with stronger performance: publish clear standards and measurable goals, release plain-language explanations of major decisions, and make underlying data and independent evaluations available whenever privacy and security allow. Build in real accountability\u2014independent oversight, routine audits, conflict-of-interest rules, and timely public reporting of mistakes and fixes\u2014so errors are corrected rather than hidden. At the same time, improve accessibility and equal treatment by offering multilingual information, multiple ways to access services, and consistent procedures that work for urban, rural, disabled, and working communities. Finally, invest in civic education and two-way engagement (town halls, citizen advisory panels, and opportunities to observe or participate) so trust is earned through ongoing openness, reliability, and shared ownership rather than partisan messaging.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in our elections\u2014and in the institutions that run them\u2014grows when the rules are clear, the process is easy to observe and verify, and every eligible voter can participate with confidence. We should treat election administration like critical public infrastructure: use voter-verifiable paper ballots (with accessible options for voters with disabilities), maintain strict chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity, and conduct routine, publicly reported post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) so outcomes can be independently confirmed. Confidence also depends on consistent, nonpartisan standards and oversight, with transparent explanations\u2014plain-language, timely, and multilingual\u2014of how ballots are cast, counted, audited, and certified, including honest reporting of mistakes and how they are corrected. Finally, we should expand practical access (reliable polling places, reasonable early or mail options with safeguards) and invest in civic and media literacy so people can distinguish evidence-based information from rumors and feel that the system is fair no matter which side wins.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should combine transparency, accountability, and equal access in ways that everyday people can see and verify. That means maintaining voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or auditable ballot records), routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where appropriate), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and clear public reporting when problems occur and how they are fixed. Trust also grows when institutions communicate in plain language and in the languages communities actually use, through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations, so people understand the rules, the safeguards, and the results. Finally, institutions should invite public oversight\u2014bipartisan observers, open meetings, and opportunities for regular citizens to serve as poll workers or volunteer monitors\u2014while keeping participation convenient and dignified for working people, seniors, and voters with disabilities. When rules are consistent, evidence is available for inspection, and officials are held accountable without partisan spin, confidence can rebuild across political and cultural lines.",
