    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is rebuilt when people can consistently see three things: fair rules, reliable performance, and real accountability when mistakes happen. That means setting clear standards that apply the same way everywhere, opening key decisions and data to independent review, and publishing plain-language explanations of what was done, why, and what was found. Institutions should strengthen safeguards\u2014strong security, documented procedures, and routine third-party audits\u2014while also removing unnecessary barriers so eligible people can participate and access services without confusion or discrimination. Just as important, leaders must be honest about errors, correct them quickly, enforce consequences for wrongdoing, and communicate through trusted local messengers in multiple languages. If institutions invite scrutiny, protect rights, and deliver results transparently and consistently over time, confidence can grow across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections is earned through processes that are easy to understand, consistently applied, and independently verifiable. We should strengthen transparency and security with auditable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable records), rigorous chain-of-custody and ballot handling standards, and routine independent post-election audits\u2014such as risk-limiting audits\u2014with clear public reporting of results. Administration should be nonpartisan with bipartisan oversight and open observation so the public can see how decisions are made and errors are corrected. At the same time, access must be protected through accessible polling places and ballots, multilingual and plain-language materials, and practical voting options for seniors, people with disabilities, rural voters, and working families. Finally, sustained, nonpartisan civic education and rapid, fact-based communication are essential to counter misinformation without dismissing legitimate questions, so every eligible voter can participate with confidence that each lawful vote is counted accurately and only once.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on rules that are clear, consistently applied, and easy for ordinary people to verify. That means strong, modern security (including cybersecurity and secure ballot handling), transparent chain-of-custody and recordkeeping, and routine independent audits with publicly posted results in plain language. Trust also requires genuine accessibility: convenient voting options, disability accommodations, multilingual materials, and straightforward instructions so working families, seniors, rural voters, and people with limited mobility or language access can participate confidently. Where communities disagree on specific safeguards (like voter ID or mail voting rules), the goal should be a balanced approach that protects eligible voters\u2019 access while preventing mistakes and fraud through verifiable records, clean voter rolls, and fair enforcement. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often\u2014fact-based, nonpartisan, and locally grounded\u2014so misinformation is addressed quickly, errors are acknowledged and corrected transparently, and people can see that the same standards apply no matter who wins.",
