    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see\u2014clearly and consistently\u2014that decisions are made fairly, based on evidence, and corrected when mistakes happen. Institutions should publish simple, plain-language explanations of how key decisions are made, disclose conflicts of interest and funding sources, and make performance data (including failures) easy to find and independently review. Strong oversight matters: regular third-party audits, transparent procurement and budgeting, and clear lines of accountability for misconduct or negligence\u2014regardless of political affiliation\u2014help reassure the public that rules apply to everyone. Trust also depends on dignity and access: services should be reliable, responsive, and accessible across languages and abilities, with real avenues for public input that are answered on the record. Finally, leaders and communicators should commit to timely, factual updates and measured rhetoric\u2014acknowledging uncertainty when it exists\u2014so credibility is earned through consistency rather than persuasion.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent procedures, and real accountability in action. We should set transparent, evidence-based standards that are applied uniformly across jurisdictions: verifiable records (such as paper ballots or auditable equivalents), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine independent post\u2011election audits (including risk\u2011limiting audits), and prompt public reporting of results, audit findings, and any problems and fixes in plain language.\n\nTrust also depends on fairness and access. Institutions should make participation practical for working people, seniors, people with disabilities, rural communities, and language-minority communities by providing accessible locations, reasonable hours, secure early and mail options where used, and clear multilingual instructions. Finally, the public should be invited into oversight\u2014through nonpartisan observers, open data dashboards, and community education in schools, libraries, and local organizations\u2014so confidence comes from verifiable evidence and neighbor-to-neighbor transparency, not partisan reassurance.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on practices people can verify for themselves: clear rules, consistent procedures, and visible accountability. That means using auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), strong chain-of-custody, routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible), and modern cybersecurity to protect systems and data.\n\nTrust also rises when institutions communicate plainly and respectfully. Provide timely, nonpartisan explanations of what happened, how results were produced, and how any errors or incidents were detected and fixed\u2014using plain language, multilingual materials (including Spanish and other common community languages), and accessible formats for seniors and people with disabilities.\n\nFinally, make participation realistic for working people and families without sacrificing integrity: well-staffed and welcoming polling places, convenient early voting where offered, secure absentee/mail options with tracking and clear safeguards, and opportunities for bipartisan/nonpartisan observation and local community involvement. When institutions are transparent, fair, and willing to be checked\u2014and when people can see the safeguards working\u2014confidence can grow across political and cultural lines.",
