It also means broad, practical access for eligible voters\u2014reasonable voting hours, accessible locations, and language support\u2014paired with strong identity and chain-of-custody safeguards so integrity and inclusion advance together.

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on procedures that are easy to verify, fair to everyone, and clearly explained. That means nonpartisan administration; secure, auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails); strong cybersecurity and strict chain-of-custody; and routine independent audits (including risk-limiting audits) with results posted publicly in plain language. Trust also grows when participation is practical for working people, caregivers, rural residents, seniors, and those who travel for work, so access should be broad and non-discriminatory (reasonable hours, early/mail options with clear safeguards, and well-run polling sites). Finally, institutions should communicate consistently and honestly\u2014sharing what safeguards exist, what problems occur, and how they\u2019re fixed\u2014while partnering with local community leaders to provide multilingual, culturally competent civic education that counters misinformation without dismissing people\u2019s concerns.",
