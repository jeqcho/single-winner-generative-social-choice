    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections increases when people can see, verify, and understand that the same fair rules apply to everyone\u2014without making it harder for eligible voters to participate. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, nonpartisan security and accountability (auditable paper ballots or voter-verifiable records, secure chain-of-custody, routine independent risk-limiting audits, transparent reporting of any problems and fixes, and modern cybersecurity) with broad, workable access (adequate polling locations and staffing, early and weekend hours, secure mail options where used with tracking, and accommodations for disability and language needs). We should also maintain accurate voter rolls through regular, evidence-based list maintenance with clear due-process notice and easy ways to correct errors, and set consistent baseline standards across states while letting local officials meet community needs. Finally, election offices should communicate in plain, multilingual language\u2014before, during, and after Election Day\u2014so misinformation has less room to grow and the public can judge results based on open facts rather than partisan claims.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in U.S. elections grows when the rules are clear, the process is easy to verify, and every eligible voter can participate without unnecessary barriers. We should use auditable paper ballots or voter-verifiable records, protect ballots with strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and run routine, independent post-election risk-limiting audits with public, plain-language reporting of what was checked and what was found. At the same time, we should keep voting accessible through well-run polling places and secure early and mail voting options with trackable status, while maintaining accurate voter rolls and fair, consistently applied eligibility checks that protect both access and integrity. Finally, transparent, multilingual voter education and nonpartisan oversight\u2014plus prompt explanations and accountability when errors occur\u2014can reduce misinformation and show that every lawful vote is counted once and counted as cast.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and verify that the rules are fair, consistently applied, and enforced without partisan advantage. A strong approach pairs transparency and accountability (auditable paper ballots or equivalent verifiable records, routine independent post-election audits such as risk-limiting audits, secure chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, clear public reporting of results and any errors) with broad, practical access (safe polling places, early and weekend hours, secure trackable absentee/mail options where offered, disability accommodations, and language access). To bridge concerns about integrity and inclusion, we should keep accurate voter rolls, use reasonable identity and eligibility checks that don\u2019t block lawful voters, and apply the same standards across jurisdictions with independent oversight and meaningful consequences for misconduct. Finally, institutions should communicate in plain, nonpartisan language\u2014through schools, community groups, and trusted local messengers\u2014so people know how decisions are made, how problems are corrected, and how to ask questions, report issues, and get answers in real time.",
