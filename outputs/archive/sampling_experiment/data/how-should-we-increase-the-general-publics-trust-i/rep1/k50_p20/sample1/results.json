    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and verify that the rules are fair, consistently applied, and enforced regardless of who is in power. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity measures\u2014auditable records, routine independent audits, clear chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and transparent reporting of problems\u2014with broad, nondiscriminatory access so eligible people can participate without unnecessary barriers. Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, publish timely data and explanations, invite bipartisan and community observation, and create clear ways to appeal decisions and correct errors. Just as important, leaders and media should commit to accuracy over speed and to explaining processes, not inflaming suspicions. When institutions are visibly accountable, easy to navigate, and open to scrutiny and improvement, trust can rebuild across political and cultural lines.",

We should make every election auditable by default (paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records), conduct routine risk-limiting post\u2011election audits with strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody and strong cybersecurity, and allow bipartisan/nonpartisan observers and independent reviews so results can be confirmed beyond partisan claims. At the same time, voting should be accessible and practical for working families, rural communities, and people with disabilities, with clear, multilingual, plain\u2011language explanations of how ballots are cast, counted, audited, and certified, plus timely public reporting when problems occur. By pairing strong safeguards that protect integrity with transparent communication and respectful service to every eligible voter, we can rebuild confidence even when people don\u2019t like the outcome.",

We should set clear, nonpartisan standards for secure and accessible participation: auditable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent verifiable trails), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine independent audits with public reports. Institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual, and disability-accessible formats, including timely updates, open data dashboards, and clear explanations of safeguards and results so rumors don\u2019t fill the gap.\n\nAt the same time, trust requires fairness and dignity: welcoming polling places, reasonable protections against fraud and intimidation, and voting options that work for busy working families, seniors, rural voters, and people with disabilities\u2014without adding unnecessary burdens for eligible voters. Finally, sustained civic education and local community engagement (schools, faith groups, civic leaders, and cultural/arts partners) should help people learn how the system works and how to raise concerns, so accountability is visible and continuous rather than partisan.",
