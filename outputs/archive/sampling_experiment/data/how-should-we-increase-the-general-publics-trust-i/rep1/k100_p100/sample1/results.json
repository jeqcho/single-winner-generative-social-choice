    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and verify that decisions are made fairly, competently, and without favoritism. That means setting clear rules, measuring performance openly, and inviting independent oversight\u2014regular audits, public reporting of errors and fixes, and real consequences when standards are violated. Institutions should communicate in plain language (and multiple languages where needed), publish accessible data and explanations for major decisions, and create easy ways for the public to ask questions, appeal outcomes, and give feedback without fear of retaliation.\n\nTrust also depends on day-to-day respect: services that are accessible to working families, rural communities, people with disabilities, and those with limited time or transportation. Finally, leaders and media should model responsible behavior\u2014separating verified facts from speculation, correcting mistakes quickly, and discouraging misinformation\u2014so disagreements are handled through evidence and accountability rather than outrage. When transparency, inclusion, and enforcement are visible, trust becomes something institutions earn and maintain across political and cultural differences.",

We should run elections with transparent, nonpartisan administration; a verifiable record of every ballot (such as voter-verifiable paper ballots or equivalent auditable records); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections; and routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits) with results published in plain language. Trust also depends on practical access: convenient polling locations and hours, secure early and mail options with clear safeguards, and accommodations and multilingual information so every eligible voter can participate with dignity. Finally, officials should communicate early, often, and factually\u2014explaining how votes are cast, counted, audited, and certified, and reporting problems and fixes promptly\u2014so confidence is built on evidence rather than rumors.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that rules are fair, decisions are evidence-based, and leaders are accountable\u2014especially when outcomes affect everyday life like elections, courts, schools, and public health. A practical way to rebuild trust is to pair strong integrity safeguards with real-world accessibility: use clear, consistent rules; keep verifiable records (for example, paper trails or auditable logs); require routine independent audits and public reporting of findings; and enforce strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity so results can be checked rather than simply asserted.\n\nTrust also depends on how institutions communicate and treat people. Institutions should explain decisions in plain language, publish timely incident reports and fixes when mistakes occur, and offer multilingual information and accessible services (disability accommodations, convenient hours, and straightforward processes that work for busy workers and caregivers). Finally, create meaningful public oversight\u2014bipartisan or nonpartisan review boards, open meetings, and opportunities for community members to observe and serve\u2014so confidence comes from transparent proof, respectful service, and equal treatment, not from partisanship or public relations.",
