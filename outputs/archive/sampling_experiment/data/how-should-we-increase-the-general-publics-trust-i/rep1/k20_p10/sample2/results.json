    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, competently, and with real accountability. Institutions should set clear rules, follow them consistently, and publish plain-language explanations of how choices are made, what evidence was used, and what safeguards prevent errors or favoritism. Independent oversight\u2014such as audits, bipartisan or cross-community review panels, and transparent performance metrics\u2014should be routine, with findings made public and problems fixed on a defined timeline. At the same time, services must be accessible: information in multiple languages, accommodations for disabilities, predictable hours, and easy-to-use channels for questions and complaints, so everyone can participate without undue burden. Finally, trust increases when leaders are honest about uncertainty and tradeoffs, respond quickly to incidents and misinformation with verifiable facts, protect privacy, and enforce consequences for misconduct\u2014showing that the institution serves the public rather than itself.",

That means setting transparent, consistent rules; using secure, verifiable processes with independent audits and publicly available results; and ensuring strong cybersecurity and data protection so services aren\u2019t disrupted and private information stays safe. Trust also depends on accessibility: plain-language, multilingual communication; easy-to-use participation options and accommodations for people with disabilities; and reliable local support so working families and underserved communities can engage without extra burden. Finally, institutions should respond quickly and honestly when problems occur, correct errors publicly, and maintain nonpartisan oversight so the public can verify performance rather than rely on assurances.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on practices people can verify for themselves: clear, rule\u2011bound procedures applied consistently; strong security and privacy protections; and independent oversight with publicly documented results. In elections, that means voter\u2011verifiable records (such as paper ballots where feasible or equivalent auditable trails), secure chain-of-custody, routine post\u2011election risk\u2011limiting audits observed by representatives across parties and communities, and prompt, plain\u2011language reporting of what happened and why.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions are easy to use and fair in practice: accessible locations and hours, accommodations for disabilities, safe and well\u2011run options for those who work long shifts or have caregiving responsibilities, and multilingual, culturally competent information. Finally, institutions should communicate early and honestly\u2014sharing what is known, what is not, and how issues are resolved\u2014while partnering with local leaders, schools, journalists, community organizations, and even artists and volunteers to explain processes and counter misinformation without partisan spin. The goal is simple: make outcomes independently checkable, services widely accessible, and accountability real\u2014so trust is earned through performance, not requested as a favor.",
