    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability regardless of party or ideology. A practical middle ground is to pair strong access with strong verification: voter-friendly options (safe in-person voting, accessible polling places, and secure absentee/early voting where allowed) alongside auditable paper records, routine risk-limiting audits, and transparent chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards. Institutions should publish plain-language, multilingual explanations of how decisions are made, what data is used, and how errors or disputes are handled, and they should welcome independent oversight from bipartisan and nonpartisan observers. Finally, leaders and agencies must communicate quickly and honestly\u2014owning mistakes, correcting misinformation with evidence, and enforcing consequences for wrongdoing\u2014so the public sees a system that is both fair to participate in and rigorous enough to verify.",

That means using auditable paper records (or voter\u2011verified paper trails), conducting routine post\u2011election risk\u2011limiting audits, strengthening cybersecurity and chain\u2011of\u2011custody protections, and welcoming nonpartisan, bipartisan, and independent observation so the public can see how integrity is safeguarded. Trust also grows when institutions explain procedures and results in plain, nonpartisan language\u2014using multilingual, accessible materials\u2014and promptly disclose mistakes and how they are corrected. Finally, fairness must be visible: consistent standards, well\u2011trained staff, strong protections against misinformation, and voting access that works for seniors, people with disabilities, rural communities, and busy families. When institutions are transparent about how decisions are made and can be independently checked, confidence follows\u2014even among people who disagree on politics.",

That means clear rules applied consistently, strong safeguards against fraud and cyberattacks, and routine independent audits with public, plain-language reports that explain what happened, what went well, and how problems were fixed. Institutions should publish data and methods when possible, invite nonpartisan observers, and communicate calmly and honestly\u2014especially when mistakes occur\u2014so people see accountability in action. At the same time, trust requires access and respect: services and voting options that work for seniors, working families, rural communities, people with disabilities, and multilingual communities, paired with practical, nonpartisan civic education that helps adults and kids understand the process. When institutions are transparent, competent, and consistently accountable\u2014without partisan spin\u2014people across backgrounds can judge them on evidence instead of rumors and feel confident the system serves the public fairly.",
