    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and verify that the rules are fair and followed consistently. A strong middle-ground approach is to pair accessible participation with rigorous, nonpartisan accountability: use voter-verifiable paper records, routine independent risk-limiting audits, clear chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and transparent public reporting of findings (including when mistakes happen and how they\u2019re corrected). Institutions should communicate in plain language, provide multilingual and disability-accessible services, and offer open forums and observation opportunities so communities can ask questions and get direct answers. By combining strong safeguards with respectful, honest outreach and education, we can reduce misinformation, protect rights, and rebuild confidence that outcomes reflect the public\u2019s will.",

That means using auditable paper records, routine independent risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and clear bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight so results can be checked and explained. Trust also grows when institutions communicate plainly and promptly about how decisions are made, what went wrong (if anything), and how it was fixed, with timely public reporting of audit findings. Finally, we should expand accessible participation\u2014language access, accommodations, and convenient voting options\u2014paired with practical civic education and community forums where residents can observe processes, ask questions, and get fact-based answers that reduce misinformation and rumors.",
