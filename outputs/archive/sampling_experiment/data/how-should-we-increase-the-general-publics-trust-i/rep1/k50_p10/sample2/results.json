    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and every eligible voter can participate without intimidation or unnecessary hurdles. We should set clear, consistent standards that protect both access and integrity: verifiable paper records (or auditable equivalents), strong chain-of-custody procedures, routine risk-limiting audits, and transparent public reporting of how results are verified and certified. Where identification or eligibility checks are used, they should be reliable, privacy-protecting, and paired with free, accessible ways to comply so lawful voters aren\u2019t turned away. Finally, we should expand plain-language, multilingual civic education and community outreach\u2014through schools, libraries, faith and civic groups\u2014so misinformation is addressed quickly, questions are answered respectfully, and citizens from all backgrounds can observe and understand how outcomes are confirmed.",

We should standardize and explain key steps in plain language (and multiple languages) from registration through counting and certification, using schools, libraries, and trusted local community organizations to share nonpartisan information and answer questions. To make outcomes verifiable, elections should use paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records, secure chain-of-custody procedures, and routine post-election risk-limiting audits with bipartisan/independent oversight and transparent public reporting down to the local level. We should strengthen cybersecurity for election offices and publish timely, understandable results updates without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we should expand opportunities for nonpartisan observers and community outreach, and directly address misinformation with facts and open channels for concerns, so people of all political views can trust that every lawful vote is counted and protected.",

    "new_statement": "Across our diverse communities, we can rebuild trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014by making the rules clear, the processes visible, and the results verifiable, while treating every eligible voter with equal respect. That means using auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), protecting secure chain-of-custody, and conducting routine, public risk-limiting audits after every election with bipartisan and independent oversight so people can confirm outcomes match the votes.\n\nTrust also grows when information is easy to access and understand: plain-language explanations of how voting, counting, and certification work; timely reporting with clear reasons when counting takes longer; and materials available in multiple languages through schools, libraries, faith groups, and local community organizations. We should strengthen cybersecurity and protections against intimidation or interference, and create respectful, well-advertised channels for questions and challenges that are resolved using evidence and consistent standards. Finally, any voter ID or ballot security measures should be designed so they deter fraud without creating unnecessary barriers for eligible voters, ensuring both integrity and broad access.",
