    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can verify the process for themselves, access it without unnecessary hurdles, and see the rules applied fairly. A strong middle-ground approach is to use paper-based, auditable voting systems with routine risk-limiting audits; publish clear chain-of-custody and security practices; and provide transparent, timely reporting that explains results in plain language. At the same time, make voting practical for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and those who travel by offering well-run polling sites, reasonable early voting, and secure absentee or mail options with ballot tracking. Protect integrity with accurate voter rolls, secure registration and ID verification that includes accessible alternatives, and enforce penalties for proven fraud while rejecting intimidation and misinformation. Finally, invest in nonpartisan civic education and multilingual outreach so every community understands how votes are cast, counted, and checked\u2014because confidence comes from both security and inclusion.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in U.S. elections rises when the system is easy to understand, consistently run, and openly verifiable\u2014no matter someone\u2019s party, background, or schedule. We should use secure, auditable voting systems with a paper record for every ballot, routine independent risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and nonpartisan/bipartisan observers, with results and audit findings reported promptly in plain language. At the same time, voting should be accessible to every eligible voter through reliable polling places, reasonable early voting and secure, trackable mail options, plus clear, multilingual voter education about how registration, ballot handling, and counting work. By combining transparency, accountability, and practical access, we can reduce suspicion and ensure people see that every legal vote is counted once and counted accurately.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should combine transparency, consistent rules, and real-world accessibility so people can see the system is fair and can participate without undue burden. That means using secure, auditable processes (paper records or voter-verifiable backups, strong chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and robust cybersecurity) with results and audit findings published in clear, plain language. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and open to scrutiny, with bipartisan observers and independent reviewers, and with meaningful consequences for fraud, misconduct, or negligence.\n\nAt the same time, trust grows when institutions respect people\u2019s time and circumstances: reliable polling places, reasonable early voting, secure and trackable mail options where used, and straightforward ID/verification methods paired with free, easy ways to obtain required documents so eligible voters aren\u2019t blocked. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education and multilingual outreach\u2014through schools, community organizations, and trusted local messengers\u2014so families, seniors, immigrants, working people, and young voters understand how decisions are made, how safeguards work, and how to verify information. When the rules are clear, the evidence is public, and access is practical, confidence can grow across political and cultural lines.",
