    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see that the rules are fair, consistently applied, and checked by independent eyes. A strong middle-ground approach is to pair broad access for eligible voters with strong verification: voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent audit trails), secure chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits with publicly posted methods and results, and transparent, bipartisan/nonpartisan observation that protects privacy and prevents intimidation. Institutions should communicate quickly and plainly about how decisions are made, what went wrong when errors occur, and how problems are fixed, using multilingual, easy-to-find information delivered through trusted local channels like libraries, schools, and community groups. Finally, investing in frontline capacity\u2014trained staff, cybersecurity, and responsive complaint processes\u2014helps people feel respected and heard, which is essential for trust even when outcomes are disappointing.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in elections, we should focus on procedures that people across parties can see, verify, and understand. That means using voter-verifiable paper ballots (or an auditable paper record), maintaining clear chain-of-custody rules, and conducting routine, publicly reported risk-limiting audits after every election, with bipartisan and independent observers able to watch and confirm the process. Election offices should communicate results promptly and plainly\u2014explaining what is known, what is still being checked, and how any errors are corrected\u2014while investing in strong cybersecurity and resilience to prevent disruptions. At the same time, voting should remain accessible and secure: clear statewide rules, well-run early/mail/in-person options with appropriate identity and eligibility checks, accessible polling places, and multilingual, easy-to-find voter information. Ongoing civic education and rapid, fact-based responses to misinformation can help communities understand how elections work and build confidence that outcomes reflect eligible voters\u2019 choices.",

We should use voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or equally auditable systems), maintain strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and require routine, publicly observed, risk-limiting audits with clear, published methods and results. Elections should be administered by nonpartisan professionals with bipartisan and citizen oversight, consistent standards, and firm protections against intimidation or interference.\n\nAt the same time, trust depends on accessibility and respect: voting should be practical for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and communities with different language needs, with clear, plain-language, multilingual information about how to register, vote, and verify results. Finally, institutions should communicate promptly and honestly\u2014especially when problems occur\u2014provide easy-to-understand explanations through schools, libraries, and community groups, and address misinformation with verifiable facts and open channels for questions and concerns. This combination of transparency, accountability, security, and access helps more people accept outcomes even when their preferred candidates lose.",
