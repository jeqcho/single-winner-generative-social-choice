    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and watch leaders take responsibility when things go wrong. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, evidence-based safeguards with genuine public access: publish clear standards and performance metrics, open key processes to independent oversight (including audits and ethics reviews), and provide plain-language, multilingual explanations of what happened and why. Institutions should reduce conflicts of interest, protect whistleblowers, enforce consequences for misconduct, and create regular, respectful forums\u2014online and in person\u2014where residents can ask questions, observe parts of the process, and receive timely, factual updates. When transparency, accountability, privacy protections, and equal access are treated as nonpartisan basics, trust can be rebuilt across communities even when people disagree on policy outcomes.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can verify that decisions are made fairly, consistently, and with accountability. That means clear rules that are applied the same way across places, nonpartisan administration, and transparency people can actually follow.\n\nFor elections specifically, we should use verifiable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable audit trails), protect chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and conduct routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits) with results published in plain language. When problems occur, institutions should report them quickly, explain what happened, and show how they were fixed.\n\nTrust also depends on real access and dignity: convenient polling options for working families, accommodations for disabilities, and multilingual information so every eligible voter can participate and understand the safeguards. Finally, civic education and community-based outreach\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations\u2014can reduce misinformation by explaining, step by step, how the process works and how the public can observe and hold institutions accountable.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on procedures that are easy for everyday people to understand, independently verified, and applied fairly. That means using verifiable records (like paper ballots or equivalent auditable records), maintaining strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and conducting routine, publicly observable post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results published in plain language.\n\nTrust also depends on respectful access and communication. Institutions should make participation practical for working people and families through reliable polling locations, reasonable hours, and secure options where allowed, while ensuring disability accommodations and clear, multilingual information (including Spanish) about how the process works and how problems are handled. When mistakes or disruptions occur, officials should report them quickly, explain what happened, fix them transparently, and hold responsible parties accountable.\n\nFinally, rebuilding trust requires community-level visibility: invite nonpartisan observers, expand opportunities for citizens to serve (as poll workers, volunteers, or oversight participants), and strengthen civics and media-literacy education in schools and local programs so kids and adults alike can tell the difference between evidence and rumors. Institutions earn trust when people can see the rules, see the checks, and see that everyone is treated with the same dignity and fairness.",
