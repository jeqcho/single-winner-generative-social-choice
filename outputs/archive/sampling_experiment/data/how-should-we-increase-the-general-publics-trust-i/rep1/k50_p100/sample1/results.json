    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see clear rules being applied consistently, when decisions are explainable, and when mistakes lead to real accountability rather than defensiveness. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, verifiable oversight (independent audits, transparent reporting, clear records and chain-of-custody where relevant, and protections for privacy) with broad, fair access and service standards so ordinary people can participate without unnecessary hurdles. Institutions should communicate early and often in plain language\u2014using multiple languages and trusted local messengers\u2014about how processes work, what safeguards exist, what went wrong when problems occur, and what will change next time. Finally, leaders should reinforce norms that build credibility across divides: nonpartisan administration, zero tolerance for corruption and intimidation, open data where feasible, and regular opportunities for community observation and feedback so trust is earned through evidence, not rhetoric.",

That means transparent, nonpartisan administration with consistent procedures, auditable records (such as voter-verifiable paper ballots or equivalent audit trails), rigorous independent post\u2011election audits, strong cybersecurity, and clear chain\u2011of\u2011custody so the public can see that results match the votes cast. Trust also requires straightforward access for all eligible participants\u2014convenient voting options, accessible locations and materials, and multilingual, plain\u2011language explanations of how decisions are made, how problems are reported, and how mistakes are corrected. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often with timely public reports, open data where appropriate, and opportunities for community observation and feedback, while countering misinformation with calm, evidence\u2011based information from trusted local partners. By combining verifiable safeguards with clear communication, equal treatment, and accountability, institutions can earn durable confidence across political and cultural differences.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on practices people can verify, rules people can understand, and services that treat every community with dignity. That starts with transparency and accountability: clear, consistent procedures; secure handling of records; independent oversight; and routine public audits with results explained in plain language (and in the major languages used locally). It also means strong protections for privacy and cybersecurity, plus timely, factual communication about problems when they occur and how they were fixed.\n\nAt the same time, trust grows when institutions are accessible and fair in everyday life: reasonable, well-communicated requirements that protect integrity; convenient ways for working families, seniors, rural residents, and people with disabilities to participate; and customer-service standards that make it easy to get answers, track requests, and file complaints. Finally, rebuilding trust requires ongoing civic education and community partnerships\u2014schools, libraries, faith groups, employers, and local nonprofits\u2014so people hear consistent information from sources they already know, and so institutions keep improving based on public feedback rather than partisan pressure.",
