    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can verify that decisions are made fairly, rules are applied consistently, and mistakes are acknowledged and fixed. A practical middle ground is to pair broad access with strong, visible safeguards: use voter-verifiable paper records (or auditable equivalents), protect chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and conduct routine, independent post-process audits with methods and results published in plain language. Institutions should communicate early and often\u2014before, during, and after major decisions\u2014using clear timelines, incident reports, and multilingual, accessible materials, while inviting bipartisan/nonpartisan observers and community members to watch and participate (e.g., public observation, open meetings, volunteer roles). Finally, accountability must be real: clear standards for performance, independent oversight, consequences for misconduct, and ongoing civics and media-literacy education so people can distinguish evidence from rumor and feel confident\u2014even when outcomes disappoint them\u2014that the process was legitimate.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear, consistent rules being followed and when outcomes are independently verifiable. We should use auditable records (such as voter-verifiable paper ballots or equivalent audit trails), routine post-event risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and transparent incident reporting so errors are detected, explained, and corrected. Oversight should be nonpartisan and publicly accountable, with opportunities for bipartisan and citizen observation that protect ballot privacy and prevent intimidation.\n\nTrust also depends on fair, practical access: clear, plain-language and multilingual information about how the process works; accessible polling places and accommodations for disability and language needs; and voting options that work for busy and working voters (including early voting and secure, trackable mail options where offered). Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education and timely, factual communication that counters misinformation without partisan spin, so people judge performance on evidence rather than rumors.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on what people across backgrounds tend to agree on: clear rules, visible checks, equal treatment, and honest communication.\n\nFirst, make outcomes independently verifiable. Use voter-verifiable paper ballots (or equivalent auditable records), strict chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine post-election risk-limiting audits conducted by nonpartisan professionals with bipartisan/independent observation. Publish audit methods and results in plain language so the public can see what was checked, what was found, and how problems were fixed.\n\nSecond, make participation practical and fair. Keep voting options accessible for working people, seniors, people with disabilities, rural voters, and those who need language support\u2014through well-run polling places, reasonable hours, secure early/mail options where used, and clear, consistent procedures that prevent both fraud and unnecessary barriers.\n\nThird, communicate with humility and transparency. Report results and any incidents promptly, correct misinformation with evidence, and create trusted local channels\u2014libraries, schools, community organizations, and multilingual outreach\u2014so residents can ask questions, observe parts of the process, and understand how decisions are made.\n\nTrust grows when institutions don\u2019t demand confidence\u2014they earn it through procedures that are easy to understand, hard to manipulate, and open to independent verification.",
