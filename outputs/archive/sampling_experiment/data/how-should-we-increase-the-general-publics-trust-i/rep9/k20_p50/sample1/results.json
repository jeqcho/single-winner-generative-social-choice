Institutions should communicate in plain language, in multiple formats and languages, protect privacy, and create easy ways for residents to participate\u2014public meetings, citizen review panels, and local partnerships with schools, libraries, faith groups, and community organizations. Finally, when mistakes happen, agencies must acknowledge them quickly, explain what changed, and enforce consequences for fraud, corruption, or abuse.
