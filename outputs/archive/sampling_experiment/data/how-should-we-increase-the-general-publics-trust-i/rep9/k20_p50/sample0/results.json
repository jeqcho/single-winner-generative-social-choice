We should strengthen transparency by publishing clear, plain-language explanations of policies, budgets, and performance, along with open data and independent audits that confirm results and investigate failures. Institutions should adopt consistent standards and guardrails\u2014strong ethics rules, conflict-of-interest limits, and real consequences for misconduct\u2014while protecting privacy and civil rights. Finally, trust improves when access is equitable: provide multilingual and disability-accessible services, reduce unnecessary bureaucracy, and create regular, well-publicized ways for the public to ask questions, observe processes, and give input through community forums and oversight bodies that include diverse stakeholders.",

That means nonpartisan administration with clear, consistently applied rules; voter\u2011verified paper ballots (or equally auditable records) with strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody; rigorous, routine post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) and transparent public reporting of results and any issues found. At the same time, institutions should communicate in plain language, provide multilingual and accessible information, and welcome respectful public observation so communities can follow how decisions are made from start to finish. Pairing strong cybersecurity and accountability with broad civic education and trusted local outreach can reduce misinformation and demonstrate\u2014through evidence, not rhetoric\u2014that the system is fair, secure, and worthy of confidence.",

In elections, this includes voter-verified paper records or similarly auditable systems, rigorous post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits), secure chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and public reporting that explains what happened and why in plain language.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions meet people where they are: accessible services for seniors and people with disabilities; convenient options for busy working families; and multilingual, culturally competent information (including Spanish and other community languages) delivered through trusted local partners like schools, libraries, workplaces, and faith or community organizations. Finally, institutions should publish performance metrics, correct mistakes quickly, and enforce real accountability for misconduct\u2014so people can see that the system is run competently, without partisan pressure, and that everyone is treated with equal dignity under the rules.",
