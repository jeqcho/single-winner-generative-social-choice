    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see fair rules being followed, mistakes being admitted and fixed, and leaders being held accountable\u2014without politics deciding the outcome. We should design public systems (including elections, schools, courts, and health agencies) around a few shared principles: clear and consistent procedures; strong privacy and security protections; independent, nonpartisan oversight with regular public audits; and plain-language communication that is timely and available in the languages people use at home. Institutions should invite meaningful public observation and feedback\u2014through open data where appropriate, community advisory boards, and well-trained frontline staff who treat everyone with dignity\u2014while enforcing real consequences for corruption, intimidation, or abuse. When services work reliably in everyday life and the evidence is easy to verify, trust can rebuild across ideological lines.",

At the same time, we should protect broad access for eligible voters\u2014reliable in\u2011person voting, early voting, and secure mail options\u2014supported by well-trained, nonpartisan local election officials and bipartisan observation. Finally, consistent, multilingual communication and ongoing civics education through trusted community institutions (schools, libraries, community centers, faith groups) can reduce misinformation, answer questions respectfully, and help people see\u2014step by step\u2014that every eligible vote is counted accurately and fairly.",

At the same time, trust grows when participation is practical for working families and accessible for seniors and people with disabilities, with options like early voting, secure mail voting, and well-run polling places. Finally, institutions must communicate consistently in plain language and multiple languages through trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, community and faith groups\u2014so people can see how decisions are made, how problems are corrected, and why the evidence supports the outcome.",
