    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when they earn it through consistent performance, openness, and accountability\u2014especially on decisions that affect everyday life. We should set clear, stable rules; publish understandable evidence for how decisions are made and money is spent; and invite independent oversight (audits, inspectors general, and bipartisan or cross-community review) with findings shared in plain language and multiple languages. Institutions should make it easy for people to participate and be heard\u2014through accessible services, public meetings, and responsive complaint processes\u2014while protecting privacy and treating everyone fairly. Finally, leaders and media partners should correct errors quickly, distinguish verified facts from speculation, and measure success with transparent metrics, so trust is built on demonstrated integrity rather than slogans.",

Election offices should communicate results and any issues promptly in plain language, publish audit methods and findings, and ensure observation is open and respectful. At the same time, we should keep participation broadly accessible\u2014well\u2011staffed polling places, reasonable early and mail options, strong disability and language access\u2014paired with practical civics education and community outreach to counter misinformation and help voters understand how the safeguards work.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on outcomes people can see for themselves: decisions made through clear rules, competent service, and evidence that can be independently checked. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; secure systems with a verifiable record (such as voter\u2011verified paper ballots or auditable equivalents); routine independent post\u2011process audits with publicly posted methods and results; and strong cybersecurity, privacy protections, and chain\u2011of\u2011custody. Trust also grows when institutions are accessible and fair in every community: convenient service hours, disability accommodations, and information in plain language and multiple languages so families can participate without confusion. Finally, institutions should communicate early and honestly\u2014what happened, what safeguards exist, and what will be improved\u2014while partnering with schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations to strengthen civic understanding and reduce misinformation.",
