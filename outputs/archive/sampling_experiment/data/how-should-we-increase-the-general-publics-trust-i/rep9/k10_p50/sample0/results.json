We should set transparent, evidence-based rules; protect privacy and civil rights; and create independent oversight with regular public reporting, open data where feasible, and routine audits that are explained in plain language. Institutions should communicate early and often through trusted local messengers, offer information in multiple languages and accessible formats, and make it easy for the public to ask questions and get timely answers. Finally, when mistakes happen, agencies must acknowledge them, correct them quickly, and show what changed\u2014because trust is built through demonstrated competence, fairness, and humility over time.",

Election administration should be professional, adequately funded, and subject to bipartisan/independent oversight, with clear, consistent rules and prompt correction and explanation when problems occur. At the same time, we should protect ballot privacy, prevent intimidation, and keep voting broadly accessible through well-run in\u2011person, early, and secure mail options. Finally, sustained nonpartisan civic education and timely, factual communication\u2014delivered through trusted local partners and in multiple languages\u2014can counter misinformation and help people see the evidence for why results are accurate.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the safeguards visible, and the results verifiable for everyday people.

Trust also grows when access is real: convenient options for working people and seniors (early, mail, and in\u2011person voting where allowed), strong disability access, and straightforward help for first\u2011time voters. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often in plain language and multiple languages (including Spanish and Asian/Pacific Island languages), through trusted local messengers like libraries, schools, community groups, and veteran and senior organizations, while correcting misinformation with timely facts\u2014not partisan spin. When people can see the evidence, understand the process, and participate without barriers, confidence in institutions can rebuild across communities.",
