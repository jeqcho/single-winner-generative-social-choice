    "new_statement": "People trust institutions\u2014including elections\u2014when they can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and experience respectful service. We should set clear, consistent standards for election administration; use verifiable voting systems with auditable paper records; protect ballots with strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and conduct routine, transparent post-election audits with bipartisan oversight and public-facing results. At the same time, voting should be accessible and understandable for eligible voters through multiple options (early, in-person, and mail where available), reasonable identity and eligibility checks, and plain-language, multilingual guidance. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and honestly, correct misinformation with evidence, protect election workers and voters, and partner with trusted local organizations (libraries, schools, veterans and faith groups, community centers) so people across backgrounds can participate confidently and hold the system accountable.",
