    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the system is both easy for eligible voters to use and hard for anyone to manipulate, with rules that are clear, consistent, and publicly verifiable. We should rely on auditable voting methods (such as paper records), strong chain-of-custody and cyber protections, and routine independent post-election audits whose methods and results are posted in plain language. Administration should be transparently nonpartisan, with bipartisan and community observers, clear consequences for proven wrongdoing, and prompt disclosure of issues and fixes. Finally, we should invest in practical access\u2014reasonable voting options, accessible polling places and materials, and multilingual, simple voter education delivered through trusted local partners\u2014so every community can participate confidently and see how outcomes are verified.",

We should set clear national standards for transparency and security while keeping local administration accountable: verifiable paper records, strict chain-of-custody, routine independent risk-limiting audits, and timely public reporting of results and any incidents. Trust also depends on real access for every eligible voter, including convenient registration and voting options, accessible polling and materials for people with disabilities, and information shared in plain language and multiple languages through trusted community partners. Finally, institutions should openly explain how safeguards work and respond quickly with facts to misinformation, so the public can confirm that outcomes are accurate, lawful, and respectful of civil rights.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should pair strong, verifiable safeguards with fair access and clear, consistent communication. That means using auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable backups), maintaining a documented chain of custody, conducting routine independent risk-limiting audits, and publishing timely, easy-to-check results and audit findings. At the same time, institutions must serve every eligible person with reliable registration and voting options, accessible polling places and materials for people with disabilities, and practical choices like early voting or vote-by-mail where implemented with strong protections. Trust also grows when information is simple, factual, and shared through schools, community groups, and local media in plain language and multiple languages, so families can understand how decisions are made and how problems are detected and corrected. Finally, rules should be applied consistently and nonpartisan professionals should be accountable\u2014so people across backgrounds can see that the process is fair, secure, and respectful of rights.",
