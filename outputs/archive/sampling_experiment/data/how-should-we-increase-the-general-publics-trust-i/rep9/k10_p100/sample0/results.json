Institutions should also create real two-way accountability\u2014easy ways to file concerns, track resolutions, and see what changed\u2014while enforcing clear ethics standards, protecting whistleblowers, and applying consequences for misconduct. Finally, trust increases when services work for everyone: accessible offices and websites, multilingual communication, fair and consistent treatment, and regular community listening sessions that lead to visible improvements. In short, competence plus transparency plus responsive accountability is the most durable path to rebuilding confidence across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the process is easy to understand, open to observation, and backed by evidence that results are correct. We should use voter-verified paper ballots (or an auditable paper record), routine independent risk-limiting audits, strong cybersecurity, and clear chain-of-custody rules so the public can verify outcomes without relying on partisan claims. Just as important, election officials should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, publish timely audit and results information, and invite bipartisan and community observers\u2014while keeping voting accessible through well-run polling places, early voting, and secure mail options. When people can both participate without barriers and see transparent proof that safeguards worked, confidence in institutions rises.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on visible fairness, easy verification, and respectful access for every eligible person. That means using voter-verifiable paper records (or equally auditable systems), protecting ballot chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and running routine independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results explained in plain language the public can review. Trust also grows when rules are clear and consistently applied, election workers and voters are treated with respect and safety, and communities can observe the process through nonpartisan, diverse local observers. Finally, institutions should invest in practical access\u2014well-staffed polling sites, reasonable early and mail options, disability accommodations\u2014and multilingual information (including Spanish) through schools, libraries, community centers, and trusted local partners so families, working people, and young citizens can understand how decisions are made and see the evidence that the system is working.",
