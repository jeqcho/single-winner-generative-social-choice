Institutions should publish clear standards, budgets, and performance measures; open key processes to independent oversight and public observation; protect privacy and civil rights; and correct mistakes quickly with transparent explanations and consequences for wrongdoing. Trust also improves when services are reliable and accessible in every community\u2014through multilingual, plain-language communication, responsive local offices, and regular opportunities for residents to ask questions, review evidence, and participate in audits, advisory boards, and community forums. By combining verifiable accountability with respectful, inclusive service, institutions can earn confidence across political and cultural differences.",

Participation must also be practical and respectful: well\u2011staffed, accessible polling places, options like early voting and secure mail voting where offered, strong privacy protections, and well\u2011trained workers and observers from across the community. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civics education and transparent, fact\u2011based communication that addresses mistakes quickly, counters misinformation, and invites public observation and questions\u2014so confidence comes from evidence and everyday experience, not slogans.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy for everyday people to verify, while treating every community with equal respect. That means using voter-verified paper records (or auditable paper backups), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine independent risk-limiting audits whose methods and findings are posted publicly in plain language. At the same time, institutions should expand practical access and service\u2014well-staffed, welcoming locations; reasonable early and mail options with safeguards; disability accommodations; and clear, multilingual information (including Spanish) so families can participate without confusion or barriers. Trust grows when rules are consistent, oversight is bipartisan and nonpartisan, misinformation is answered quickly with facts, and local officials invite public observation and questions so people can see the system work in their own communities.",
