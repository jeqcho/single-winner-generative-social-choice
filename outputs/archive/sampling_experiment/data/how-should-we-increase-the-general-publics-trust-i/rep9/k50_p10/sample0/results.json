Administration should be professional and nonpartisan, with strong protections against political interference, clear standards for fixing problems, and prompt, factual communication when issues occur. At the same time, participation must be practical and inclusive: reasonable voting options, accessible polling places, language assistance, and straightforward, plain-language explanations of how ballots are cast, protected, counted, and checked. Finally, partnering with trusted local groups\u2014libraries, veterans\u2019 organizations, faith and civic leaders, and schools\u2014can help deliver consistent information and counter misinformation in ways people across communities will accept.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and independently verify that decisions are made fairly, securely, and without partisan interference. We should use transparent, consistently applied procedures with nonpartisan administration and bipartisan oversight; rely on verifiable records (such as auditable paper ballots or equivalent verifiable systems); and conduct routine independent post-election audits, including risk-limiting audits, alongside strong cybersecurity and regular equipment testing. Trust also depends on clear, plain-language communication: timely explanations of how processes work, what safeguards exist, and how any problems are found and corrected. Finally, institutions should make participation accessible and inclusive through convenient options (early, mail, and in-person), disability and language access, well-trained staff, and community partnerships that help counter misinformation with accurate, consistent information.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in key institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few standards people across backgrounds can agree on: clear rules, independent verification, equal treatment, and honest communication. That means nonpartisan administration with strong safeguards against political pressure; secure systems with an auditable paper record (or an equally verifiable backup) and routine, public post-process audits like risk-limiting audits; and independent testing and cybersecurity reviews with results shared in plain language. Trust also grows when participation is genuinely accessible\u2014short lines, reliable staffing and training, disability access, and convenient options like early and mail voting\u2014paired with strong privacy protections so people can participate without fear. Finally, institutions should communicate early and consistently in multiple languages, work with trusted local partners (schools, community groups, faith leaders, libraries), quickly correct mistakes, and explain what happened and what changed. When people can see how decisions are made, how results are checked, and how problems are fixed\u2014regardless of party or community\u2014confidence rises and misinformation has less room to spread.",
