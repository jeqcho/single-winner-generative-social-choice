    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, competently, and with real accountability\u2014regardless of who is in power. We should set clear, consistent standards for how public agencies operate, publish understandable evidence for key decisions (budgets, performance metrics, and audit findings), and use independent oversight with public reporting so mistakes are acknowledged and corrected. Institutions should make it easy for residents to participate and be heard\u2014through accessible services, multilingual communication, open meetings, and responsive complaint processes\u2014while protecting privacy and civil rights. When institutions are transparent about what they know, what they don\u2019t, and how they improve, trust becomes based on observable performance rather than slogans or partisan loyalty.",

That means setting clear, consistently applied rules; investing in competent, nonpartisan local administration; and building strong safeguards such as auditable records, independent reviews, and secure data practices that protect privacy while enabling public accountability. Institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual language, publish timely and accessible reports (including what went right and what went wrong), invite respectful public observation and input, and partner with trusted community hubs like schools, libraries, and community centers for ongoing civic education. By combining transparency, security, accessibility, and evidence-based oversight\u2014and by correcting mistakes openly\u2014we can reduce misinformation, strengthen equal participation, and rebuild confidence that institutions serve the public rather than politics.",

That means clear, consistent rules; strong, independent oversight and routine audits; and simple public reporting that explains what was done, why, and what the evidence shows. Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, protect privacy, and ensure real access for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and underserved communities. Trust also grows when local communities can observe and participate\u2014through open meetings, public records that are easy to use, community advisory roles, and respectful, well-trained staff who can answer questions and correct mistakes quickly. By pairing transparency and accountability with fairness, accessibility, and nonpartisan professionalism, institutions can earn confidence through reliable results and everyday experiences that people recognize as honest and competent.",
