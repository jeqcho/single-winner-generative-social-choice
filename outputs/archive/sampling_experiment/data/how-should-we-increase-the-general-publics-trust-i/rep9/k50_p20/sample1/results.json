    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions increases when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and experience services that work reliably in their daily lives. Across government agencies, schools, courts, public health, and elections, we should set clear standards for transparency (plain-language explanations, open meetings where appropriate, and publishable evidence for major decisions), independent oversight (inspectors general, nonpartisan audits, and protected whistleblower channels), and consistent accountability (timely correction of errors and consequences for misconduct). Institutions should also invest in two-way communication\u2014local listening sessions, community partnerships, multilingual and accessible materials, and rapid responses to misinformation\u2014so concerns are addressed respectfully rather than dismissed. Finally, trust grows when access is fair: simplify processes, reduce waiting and paperwork, protect privacy, and ensure equal service quality across communities so people feel institutions serve everyone, not just the well-connected.",

We should pair secure, auditable systems (paper ballots or voter-verifiable records, strong chain-of-custody, cybersecurity, and routine risk-limiting post-election audits) with truly independent, nonpartisan oversight and transparent public reporting of procedures, findings, and any discrepancies. Just as important, institutions must communicate early and often in plain language and multiple languages, invite public observation in respectful ways, and invest in civic education through schools, libraries, and community partners to counter misinformation. When access is convenient and inclusive\u2014safe polling places, reasonable wait times, disability accommodations, and secure options to vote\u2014people are more likely to believe the process is competent, accountable, and worthy of their trust.",
