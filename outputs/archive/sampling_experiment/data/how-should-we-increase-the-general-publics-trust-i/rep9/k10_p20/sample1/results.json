    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and verify that the rules are fair, the work is competent, and the results are checked. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity measures (voter-verified paper records or equivalent auditable backups, secure chain-of-custody, routine independent post-election audits, and transparent public reporting) with broad, non-discriminatory access (reliable in-person options, early voting where feasible, accessible polling places, and clear guidance for mail voting). Standards should be consistent enough to reduce confusion while leaving room for local administration, and oversight should be genuinely bipartisan and open to trained nonpartisan observers. Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages through trusted local channels, publish audit findings and corrective actions, and invite community participation (poll workers, observers, civic education) so accountability is visible, not assumed.",

We should standardize transparent, verifiable safeguards nationwide: voter-verified paper ballots (or auditable paper records), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine independent risk-limiting audits, and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with results reported clearly and promptly. Trust also depends on real access, so voting should be secure and convenient for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and communities with limited resources\u2014through well-staffed polling places, reasonable early voting options, and reliable mail or drop-box choices where allowed. Finally, officials, media, and community partners should provide plain-language, multilingual (including Spanish) voter education and regular factual updates that explain how ballots are protected, counted, and recounted, so confidence comes from understanding and local visibility\u2014not from partisan claims.",

Trust also grows when access is real and fair for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and underserved communities\u2014through well-staffed polling places, reasonable early voting options, reliable mail voting where offered, and clear instructions. Communication should be timely, factual, and community-centered, including multilingual materials (especially Spanish) and partnerships with trusted local messengers like schools, churches, community groups, and employers.
