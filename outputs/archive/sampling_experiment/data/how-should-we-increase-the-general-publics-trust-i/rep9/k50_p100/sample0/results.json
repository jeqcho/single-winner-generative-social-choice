    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions rises when people can see clear standards, honest performance, and real accountability\u2014without feeling talked down to or shut out. A practical middle ground is to make institutions easier to verify and harder to politicize: publish plain-language rules and decision criteria, open key processes to independent review, release timely public data (with strong privacy protections), and create routine audits with findings that are easy for non-experts to understand. Institutions should pair this transparency with dependable service\u2014fair access, respectful treatment, and reliable staffing\u2014so everyday experiences match official claims. Finally, leaders and media should commit to correcting errors quickly, naming uncertainty when it exists, and enforcing consequences for misconduct, while supporting civic education and community partnerships that help people ask questions, observe processes, and see how concerns are resolved in practice.",

We should use voter\u2011verified paper ballots (or paper backups for every vote), maintain strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody and strong cybersecurity, and conduct routine independent, bipartisan post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) with results published in plain language. At the same time, we should ensure accessible polling places and voting options that work for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and multilingual communities, supported by clear, nonpartisan voter education through schools, libraries, and trusted local partners. Consistent rules, professional nonpartisan administration, and transparent communication about how ballots are cast, counted, and checked can reduce misinformation and help every community see\u2014directly and with evidence\u2014that the outcome reflects the will of the voters.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on systems that are easy to see, easy to verify, and fair to everyone. That means using voter\u2011verified paper ballots (or a clear paper backup), protecting privacy, securing equipment and voter data, and requiring routine, independent post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) with results published in plain language. Rules should be clear and consistent, administered by trained, nonpartisan professionals with bipartisan and community observation so people can watch the process without intimidation.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions communicate early and honestly: share what safeguards exist, what problems occurred (if any), how they were fixed, and how the public can check the evidence themselves. Finally, make participation practical and inclusive\u2014accessible polling places, reasonable options like early and mail voting with strong safeguards, and multilingual (including Spanish) and disability\u2011accessible information\u2014delivered through trusted local channels such as schools, libraries, community centers, and faith and civic groups. When people can both participate and independently verify outcomes, confidence rises across communities and political views.",
