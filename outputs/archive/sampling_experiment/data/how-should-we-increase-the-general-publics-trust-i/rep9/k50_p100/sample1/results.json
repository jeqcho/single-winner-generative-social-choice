Institutions should publish clear standards, measurable goals, and plain-language reasons for major decisions; open key processes to independent review (including audits and public reporting); and protect whistleblowers and inspectors general so problems are surfaced and fixed. Just as important, they should make participation and access easier\u2014through multilingual communication, disability accommodations, and responsive local offices\u2014while safeguarding privacy and due process. When institutions consistently tell the truth, share evidence, invite community oversight, and correct errors quickly and transparently, confidence can rebuild over time.",

Institutions should publish clear, plain-language explanations of their rules, funding, and performance; open their processes to public observation and independent review; and back claims with accessible data while protecting privacy and personal information. Strong, nonpartisan oversight (including bipartisan or cross-community representation where relevant), routine third-party audits, and transparent reporting of errors and corrections can demonstrate accountability without partisan spin. Trust also increases when services are reliable and accessible\u2014through adequate staffing, disability accommodations, multilingual information, and convenient ways for working families to participate and give input. Finally, institutions should actively counter misinformation by communicating early and often through trusted local partners\u2014schools, libraries, community centers, faith groups, and local media\u2014so people can separate facts from rumors and see that the system works for everyone.",
