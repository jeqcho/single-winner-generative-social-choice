    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see\u2014clearly and consistently\u2014how decisions are made, how money is spent, and how leaders are held accountable when things go wrong. Institutions should publish plain-language goals and performance measures, release independent audit and evaluation results, and make key data accessible while protecting personal privacy. Decision-making should include meaningful public input through local forums and representative advisory groups, and rules should be applied fairly across communities. Finally, institutions should invest in reliable frontline service, professional nonpartisan administration, strong ethics enforcement, and fast, transparent correction of mistakes\u2014so trust is earned through visible competence, integrity, and equal treatment rather than promises.",

    "new_statement": "We can increase the public\u2019s trust in key institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014by making decisions and outcomes easy for everyday people to verify, while ensuring fair access and nonpartisan accountability. That means using voter\u2011verifiable paper records (or equally auditable equivalents), strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) with results and methods published in plain language. Institutions should invite public observation and bipartisan oversight, train and protect frontline staff, and communicate quickly and factually about problems and fixes. Finally, trust grows when participation is practical and inclusive: reliable local administration, accessible polling places, reasonable options like early and mail voting with safeguards, and clear multilingual voter education through schools, libraries, and community partners to reduce confusion and misinformation.",

We should set clear, consistent standards that apply everywhere, publish plain-language explanations (in multiple languages) of the rules and evidence behind decisions, and create routine independent audits and public reporting that show what worked, what didn\u2019t, and how problems will be fixed. Institutions should invite community observation and feedback, protect privacy and civil rights, and invest in frontline capacity\u2014trained staff, accessible services for people with disabilities, and responsive local offices\u2014so the experience matches the promises. Finally, trusted messengers like schools, libraries, faith and community groups, and local media should be partners in civic education and misinformation-response, so families can get accurate information and feel respected rather than dismissed.",
