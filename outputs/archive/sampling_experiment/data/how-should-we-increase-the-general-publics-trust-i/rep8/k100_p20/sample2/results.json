    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear standards, competent administration, and real accountability, regardless of party or geography. We should set baseline, uniform practices that every jurisdiction can meet (secure, auditable records such as paper or voter-verifiable backups; routine post-election audits with publicly posted results; and strong cybersecurity), while keeping decisions as local and transparent as possible through bipartisan or multipartisan oversight, open observation, and prompt explanations when issues arise. Trust also requires equal, practical access: well-staffed and safe polling places, reasonable early and mail options with strong chain-of-custody protections, and plain-language, multilingual, and disability-accessible information shared through trusted community channels like schools, libraries, faith groups, and local media. Finally, institutions should commit to publishing easy-to-understand data, correcting misinformation quickly with evidence, and enforcing consequences for wrongdoing\u2014so the public sees that rules are followed, results are verifiable, and every eligible person is treated fairly.",

That means maintaining auditable paper records (or an equivalent voter-verifiable trail), routine risk-limiting post-election audits, and robust cybersecurity, all overseen by independent, nonpartisan professionals with bipartisan public observation. Institutions should publish plain-language, multilingual explanations of the rules and the certification process, share timely and accurate results with supporting audit reports, and respond quickly and credibly to irregularities to prevent misinformation from filling the gap. Finally, we should invest in well-staffed, accessible services (including disability and language accommodations), nonpartisan civic education, and public \u201copen house\u201d opportunities so people can see how the process works\u2014building trust through competence, fairness, and proof.",

That means clear, consistently applied procedures; secure systems with a reliable paper record; routine independent audits with publicly posted, plain-language findings; and strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections. Institutions should communicate early and often in accessible formats (including multiple languages), correct misinformation with evidence rather than partisan messaging, and respond quickly and transparently when problems occur. Finally, trust grows when people can see accountability up close\u2014through nonpartisan local oversight, open observation, well-trained staff, and community education partnerships (schools, libraries, and civic groups) so families, seniors, and working people understand how decisions are made and how integrity is enforced.",
