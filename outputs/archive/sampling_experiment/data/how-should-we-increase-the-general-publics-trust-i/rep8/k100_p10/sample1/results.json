    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify results independently, and get fair treatment no matter their politics or background. A practical middle ground is to set clear, consistent rules; publish performance data and audit results in plain language; and invite independent, bipartisan oversight with real authority to investigate and correct problems. Institutions should make services easy to use (simple forms, accessible locations, multilingual materials), protect privacy and security, and be transparent about mistakes\u2014explaining what happened, who is accountable, and what will change. Finally, leaders and media should communicate uncertainty honestly, avoid premature claims, and focus on evidence and process, so trust is earned through steady competence rather than slogans.",

Finally, trust improves when services are accessible and user-centered: well-trained staff, adequate resources, secure systems (including strong cybersecurity where relevant), and reliable community channels like schools, libraries, and local organizations to share nonpartisan information and correct misinformation.
