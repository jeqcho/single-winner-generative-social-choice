    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and get honest answers when things go wrong. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, checkable safeguards with respectful access: publish clear plain-language summaries of policies, budgets, and performance; use independent audits and oversight boards with members from multiple viewpoints; and make data and methods available for public review while protecting privacy and security. Institutions should set consistent standards, disclose conflicts of interest, enforce meaningful consequences for misconduct, and create simple ways for residents to observe, ask questions, appeal decisions, and get timely corrections when errors occur. Finally, ongoing civic education and partnerships with trusted local organizations can counter misinformation and help people understand not just what institutions decided, but why\u2014and how the public can hold them accountable.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on what people can verify for themselves: clear rules, transparent operations, and independent checks. Use auditable paper records (or voter-verifiable paper backups), routine risk-limiting post\u2011election audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and publish plain-language, timely reports of results, audits, and any problems found and fixed. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and open to public observation, with trained local officials and adequately funded election offices. Finally, pair these safeguards with accessible, multilingual, easy-to-understand civic education through schools, libraries, and community organizations so every community can see how the process works, ask questions, and feel confident that outcomes are fair and verifiable.",

    "new_statement": "We can increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014by proving, in ways ordinary people can see and understand, that decisions are made fairly, lawfully, and with real accountability. That means transparent, verifiable processes (such as paper records where feasible, secure chain-of-custody, and routine independent audits), clear and timely public reporting of results and any problems, and nonpartisan oversight that includes observers from different viewpoints. Trust also requires equal, practical access: well-staffed and safe locations, reasonable early and mail options where allowed, strong disability and language support, and simple explanations of how rules work and why they exist. Finally, institutions should communicate consistently in plain language, correct mistakes openly, protect privacy and data security, and partner with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, faith groups, and community organizations\u2014to provide civics education and counter misinformation without partisan spin. When people can verify the process, feel respected, and see consequences for misconduct, confidence rises even when outcomes are disappointing.",
