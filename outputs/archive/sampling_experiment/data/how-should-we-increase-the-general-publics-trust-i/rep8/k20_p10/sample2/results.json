    "new_statement": "Public trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can independently verify outcomes, see rules applied fairly, and feel their communities are respected. A practical middle ground is to strengthen transparency and accountability without unnecessary centralization: use paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records wherever possible; conduct routine, publicly reported post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits); and publish clear, plain-language explanations of counting, chain-of-custody, and how errors are detected and corrected. Pair this with strong, consistent cybersecurity and privacy protections, bipartisan and independent oversight with real enforcement power, and adequate funding so local officials can run elections competently. At the same time, expand access in ways that keep integrity high\u2014well-staffed polling places, secure early and mail options where allowed, disability and language access, and nonpartisan civic education delivered through trusted local groups\u2014so participation is broad and confidence is earned through evidence, not rhetoric.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decision-making and results easy to verify, easy to understand, and fair in practice. That means keeping strong local administration with clear, consistent standards: paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records wherever feasible; routine, nonpartisan post-process audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with publicly posted methods and findings; and rigorous cybersecurity and privacy protections so systems are resilient without exposing personal data. Trust also depends on equal access and respectful communication, so institutions should provide plain-language, multilingual information, accessible services for seniors and people with disabilities, and practical options like early voting and secure mail-in voting where appropriate. When mistakes happen, leaders should disclose them quickly, explain what changed, and show the evidence behind corrections. Finally, inviting broad community participation\u2014training poll workers and independent observers from across parties and neighborhoods, partnering with schools, libraries, faith groups, and civic organizations for nonpartisan education\u2014helps people see the process up close and builds confidence that institutions serve everyone, not any one side.",
