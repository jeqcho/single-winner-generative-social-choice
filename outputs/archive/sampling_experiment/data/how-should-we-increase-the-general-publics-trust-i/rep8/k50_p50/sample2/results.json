    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see, verify, and understand how decisions are made, and when rules are applied fairly. A practical middle-ground approach is to pair strong, auditable safeguards (such as voter-verified paper records, secure chain-of-custody, routine independent risk-limiting audits, and transparent incident reporting) with broad, lawful access to participation (well-staffed polling places, reasonable early and mail options, disability and language accommodations, and clear help for first-time voters). Where identity checks are used, they should be reliable, consistently administered, and designed so eligible voters can comply without undue burden. Institutions should publish plain-language explanations, open their processes to bipartisan and public observation, correct mistakes publicly, and invest in ongoing civics education and community partnerships to reduce misinformation. Trust isn\u2019t won by reassurance\u2014it\u2019s earned through competence, accountability, and transparency that people of different backgrounds can inspect for themselves.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can clearly see how decisions are made, verify outcomes independently, and feel respected and included. For elections, that means using auditable records (such as voter-verified paper ballots), routine risk-limiting post\u2011election audits, secure chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and transparent incident reporting when problems occur. It also means nonpartisan, locally accountable administration with bipartisan or independent observation, clear and consistent rules, and timely public reporting that explains what\u2019s happening in plain language.\n\nTo make trust durable, institutions should invest in practical, nonpartisan public education that meets people where they are\u2014schools, libraries, community centers, and trusted community groups\u2014with multilingual, accessible materials (including for people with disabilities). When everyday residents can understand the process, observe it, and check the results without partisan spin, confidence rises because trust is earned through verifiable performance, not slogans.",

Trust also grows when participation is straightforward and fair for eligible voters\u2014safe, well\u2011staffed, accessible voting options; reasonable and consistently applied rules; accurate voter rolls with clear processes to correct errors; and protections for voter privacy.
