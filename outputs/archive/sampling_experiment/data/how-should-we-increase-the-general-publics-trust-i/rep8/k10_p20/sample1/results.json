    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, verify, and understand how decisions are made and corrected when mistakes happen. A practical middle ground is to combine strong, common-sense safeguards (auditable paper records, routine independent audits, secure chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and clear rules that are applied consistently) with real public accountability (plain-language explanations, timely reporting, open observation opportunities, and transparent responses to errors and complaints). Trust also requires equal access: accessible polling places and voting options, multilingual and disability-friendly materials, and steady funding and training for local administrators so the system runs reliably everywhere. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education and partnerships with trusted community groups to reduce misinformation without partisan messaging, so people of all backgrounds can participate confidently and judge outcomes based on evidence.",

A strong foundation is an auditable paper record for every ballot, secure chain-of-custody procedures, and routine independent, bipartisan risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language. We should treat election systems like critical infrastructure: invest in cybersecurity, staffing, and training for local election offices, and report problems and fixes quickly and transparently. Trust also requires equal, practical access\u2014accessible polling places, clear voter guidance in multiple languages, and community-based outreach through schools, libraries, and trusted local groups\u2014so every eligible voter understands how to cast a ballot and how it is counted. Finally, open observation, public briefings, and \u201copen house\u201d opportunities at election offices can replace rumors with firsthand understanding and strengthen confidence across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should pair strong, common-sense safeguards with clear, everyday transparency. That means auditable paper records for every ballot, routine independent risk-limiting audits, strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections, and nonpartisan, locally accountable oversight with bipartisan observer access. Trust also grows when institutions communicate plainly and promptly: publish easy-to-read explanations of how decisions are made and verified, share public reports (including what went wrong and how it was fixed), and provide materials in multiple languages and accessible formats for seniors and people with disabilities. Finally, invest in ongoing civic education and community outreach through trusted local partners\u2014schools, libraries, community organizations, and faith groups\u2014so people can see the process up close, ask questions, and verify facts without partisan spin. When institutions are transparent, consistent, and willing to be audited and corrected in public, confidence can grow across backgrounds and political views.",
