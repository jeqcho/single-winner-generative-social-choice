    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014rises when people can see that rules are fair, results are verifiable, and services are delivered respectfully to everyone. We should adopt clear, consistently applied standards for ballot design, voter registration, and ballot handling; use paper-based or voter-verifiable records; and conduct routine, publicly reported, independent audits such as risk-limiting audits. At the same time, institutions must communicate in plain language, in multiple languages, and through trusted local messengers, promptly correcting misinformation while acknowledging uncertainty when it exists. Finally, access and integrity should advance together: well-staffed and safe polling places, reasonable early and mail options with strong security, disability accommodations, and ongoing civic education so people understand not just what the rules are, but why they protect both participation and accuracy.",

We should treat election administration like critical infrastructure: use secure, auditable systems with a voter-verifiable paper trail; conduct routine, independent risk-limiting audits; and publish timely, plain-language explanations of safeguards, results, and any vulnerabilities and corrections. Access must be part of integrity: consistent rules that are communicated clearly, well-resourced and well-staffed polling places, secure options like early voting and mail where available, and strong accommodations for disabilities and language access. Finally, rebuild confidence through sustained, nonpartisan public engagement\u2014civics education, community outreach through trusted local partners, and opportunities for the public to observe or visit election operations\u2014so transparency is not a slogan but an experience people can inspect for themselves.",

It also means accessible options that fit real lives\u2014well-staffed polling places, clear mail/early voting rules, disability accommodations, and reliable voter registration\u2014so integrity and access are strengthened together rather than treated as tradeoffs.

Trust grows when people can see the safeguards, understand the decisions, and experience fair treatment every time they interact with the system.",
