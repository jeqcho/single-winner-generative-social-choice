    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when rules are clear, results are verifiable, and leaders are accountable in ways ordinary people can see. We should invest in modern, secure infrastructure that produces an auditable record (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), conduct routine independent post-election audits with publicly posted methods and findings, and make observation and oversight accessible through nonpartisan, community-based monitors. Access and integrity can advance together: consistent procedures, well-trained staff, reasonable identity and eligibility verification that does not block eligible voters, and multiple safe ways to vote. Institutions should communicate early and often in plain language and multiple languages, correct mistakes transparently, and partner with trusted local organizations\u2014schools, libraries, veterans groups, faith communities, and nonprofits\u2014to provide accurate information and reduce misinformation. When people can understand how decisions are made, check the safeguards for themselves, and see fair treatment across communities, confidence rises even when outcomes are disappointing.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in our elections\u2014and in the institutions that carry them out\u2014we should focus on steps people can see, verify, and understand. That means using paper ballots or voter-verifiable records wherever feasible, conducting routine risk-limiting post-election audits, and providing independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with clear public observation rules. Just as important, election officials should communicate early and often in plain language and multiple languages through schools, libraries, community centers, faith groups, and trusted local partners, explaining how votes are cast, counted, secured, and certified\u2014and how any mistakes are corrected. By pairing strong security (including cybersecurity and protection of voter data) with accessible voting options and transparent, timely reporting, we can reduce misinformation, ensure equal access, and help more Americans accept results because the process is demonstrably fair.",

That means clear, consistent rules; nonpartisan administration; and verifiable outcomes using paper ballots or voter-verifiable records, routine risk-limiting audits, strong cybersecurity, and public reporting that explains what happened, including any errors and how they were fixed. Trust also grows when participation is practical and fair: well-staffed, accessible polling places; secure early and mail options with ballot tracking where available; disability accommodations; and language access (including Spanish, Vietnamese, and other community languages). Finally, institutions should partner with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, faith groups, veterans and civic organizations, and community leaders\u2014to provide plain-language, multilingual education and to address misinformation with facts and transparency rather than partisan messaging. When people can verify results, observe oversight, and feel respected at every step, confidence rises even when outcomes disappoint them.",
