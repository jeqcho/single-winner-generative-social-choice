    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can verify outcomes, understand decisions, and see that rules are applied consistently to everyone. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, auditable safeguards with broad, fair access and clear communication: use voter-verified paper records (or equivalent) that can be independently audited, conduct routine post-process risk-limiting audits with bipartisan and community observation, and publish plain-language explanations of procedures, incidents, and results on a predictable timeline. Protect eligibility through accurate voter rolls and reasonable identity verification options that don\u2019t create unnecessary barriers, while offering secure, well-managed ways to participate (reliable polling places, early voting, and trackable absentee/mail options where allowed). Finally, invest in nonpartisan public education and local outreach\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted community groups\u2014in multiple languages and formats, so people can see how the system works, ask questions, and hold officials accountable without turning administration into partisan combat.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should combine strong, verifiable safeguards with clear, everyday transparency. That means maintaining an auditable paper trail (paper ballots where feasible or voter-verifiable paper records), running routine post-election risk-limiting audits, and strengthening cybersecurity and incident reporting so results can be independently checked. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan, with bipartisan observers and consistent, publicly posted procedures that are applied the same way across communities. Just as important, institutions must communicate in plain language and multiple languages, using simple visuals and community-based outreach through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations, so people can understand how decisions are made and how problems are fixed. Trust grows when systems are secure and fair, and when regular people can see, verify, and access them without partisan spin.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should combine strong, verifiable safeguards with everyday transparency and respectful communication.\n\nFirst, make outcomes independently checkable: use auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), routine risk-limiting audits, strong cybersecurity, and clear chain-of-custody rules, with meaningful consequences for proven misconduct. Second, ensure oversight people can recognize as fair: nonpartisan professional administration with bipartisan observation, public incident reporting, and consistent, predictable rules so no community feels the system changes midstream. Third, make the process understandable and accessible: plain-language explanations, multilingual materials, disability accommodations, reasonable in-person and early options, secure tracking where used, and community outreach through trusted local places like schools, libraries, veterans\u2019 groups, faith communities, and civic organizations.\n\nTrust grows when institutions do what they say, show their work, treat people equally, and invite the public to see how decisions are made\u2014so confidence comes from evidence and openness, not from slogans or partisan spin.",
