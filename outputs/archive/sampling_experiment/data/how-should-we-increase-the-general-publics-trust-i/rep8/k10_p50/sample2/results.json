    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014improves when people can see, verify, and understand how decisions are made, and when the rules are applied consistently and fairly. A practical middle-ground approach is to combine broad access with strong, observable safeguards: voter-verified paper records (or equivalent auditable trails), routine independent risk-limiting audits, secure chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and transparent, timely public reporting of results, errors, and fixes. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and open to bipartisan observers, with clear guardrails that protect both ballot access and privacy. Finally, institutions should invest in plain-language, multilingual public education and partnerships with trusted local groups (schools, libraries, faith and community organizations) so misinformation is corrected quickly and every community can participate with confidence.",

Administration should be nonpartisan and well\u2011resourced, with bipartisan observation and clear accountability when problems occur, including prompt, plain\u2011language explanations of what happened and how it was fixed. Just as important, institutions should make participation and understanding practical for everyday people: accessible polling places, secure early/mail options where appropriate, strong cybersecurity and privacy protections, and voter education that is simple, multilingual, and delivered through trusted local partners to reduce confusion and misinformation. Trust isn\u2019t earned through slogans\u2014it\u2019s earned through procedures that any reasonable member of the public can see, check, and understand.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on clear rules, independent verification, and respectful service that people can see for themselves. That means using voting systems with voter\u2011verified paper records, secure chain\u2011of\u2011custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) with results published quickly and in plain language. Oversight should be independent and transparent, with meaningful access for observers across viewpoints, and consistent standards so the rules are applied the same way everywhere. Trust also grows when institutions communicate early and honestly about problems and fixes, invest in well\u2011trained staff and adequate funding, protect privacy, and provide straightforward public education (in schools and communities) that helps people recognize misinformation and understand how decisions are made. Security and access should be balanced so eligible citizens can participate without unnecessary barriers while everyone can verify that outcomes are accurate and fair.",
