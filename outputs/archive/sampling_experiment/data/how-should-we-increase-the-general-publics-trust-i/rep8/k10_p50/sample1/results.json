    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014rises when people can verify how decisions are made, see that rules are applied consistently, and know problems are acknowledged and fixed. A practical middle path is to pair strong, privacy\u2011respecting integrity safeguards (auditable records such as paper ballots where applicable, secure chain-of-custody, routine independent audits, accurate voter rolls, and clear standards for eligibility) with broad, fair access for eligible participants (well-staffed locations, reasonable early and mail options, disability and language accommodations). Institutions should publish plain-language, data-backed explanations of procedures and results, share incident reports promptly, and invite bipartisan and nonpartisan community observers so oversight is credible. Finally, long-term civics education and local partnerships with trusted messengers can reduce misinformation and help people judge institutions by transparent evidence rather than partisan claims.",

We should make core processes transparent and verifiable (clear records, independent audits, and publicly posted results and performance metrics), communicate in plain language and multiple languages, and report mistakes quickly along with what\u2019s being fixed. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan\u2014welcoming observers from across viewpoints and local community members\u2014while protecting privacy and avoiding unnecessary centralized control. Finally, institutions need to be accessible and respectful in practice: reliable service, consistent rules, well-trained staff, and ongoing civics education and community outreach (in schools, libraries, and trusted local spaces) to counter misinformation with clear, factual information. When people can understand the rules, verify outcomes, and feel included, they\u2019re more likely to accept results even when they disagree.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few basics that people across backgrounds can see, understand, and verify: clear rules applied consistently, strong protections against tampering, and honest accountability when problems happen. That means using auditable records (like voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent paper trails), routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits), secure chain-of-custody, and transparent reporting of results and audit findings in plain language.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions serve people respectfully and make participation practical: well-funded and well-trained frontline staff, accessible locations and hours, disability accommodations, and language access where needed. Policies like voter roll maintenance, identity checks where used, and ballot access rules should be designed to protect both security and equal participation, with evidence-based standards and public input.\n\nFinally, institutions and community partners (schools, libraries, local media, faith and civic groups) should provide nonpartisan, easy-to-follow explanations of how decisions are made and how people can raise concerns\u2014while countering misinformation with timely facts and open data. When the process is verifiable, the communication is clear, and the system treats every person fairly, more people will accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",
