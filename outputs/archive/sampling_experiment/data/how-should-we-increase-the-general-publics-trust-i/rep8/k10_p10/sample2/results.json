    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions like election systems grows when rules are clear, applied consistently, and results can be verified by evidence rather than rhetoric. A strong middle-ground approach is to pair broad, practical access for every eligible voter (well-staffed polling places, secure early and mail options where allowed, accommodations for disabilities, and multilingual help) with safeguards that are visible and testable (accurate voter registration and list maintenance with due process, secure chain-of-custody, auditable paper records, and routine independent risk-limiting audits). Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan\u2014open to observers from multiple parties and community stakeholders\u2014while protecting voters\u2019 privacy and safety. Institutions should communicate in plain language, publish audit and security findings, correct mistakes quickly, and invest in ongoing civic education and media-literacy efforts so people understand how decisions are made and how verification works. Trust is earned when institutions make it easy to participate, hard to cheat, and straightforward for the public to check the work.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in our elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see that rules are fair, consistently applied, and independently verified. We should strengthen transparent, nonpartisan administration with bipartisan public observation, verifiable paper records or auditable backups, regular risk-limiting audits, and strong cybersecurity, paired with clear, timely, plain-language reporting of how votes are counted and why results are reliable. To protect both integrity and access, we should keep voter rolls accurate and regularly audited while ensuring every eligible voter can participate through well-staffed, accessible polling places and practical options like early voting and secure mail voting where allowed. Finally, sustained civics education, multilingual/nontechnical voter information, and rapid, evidence-based responses to misinformation can help communities understand the process and feel confident their voice is counted.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on transparency, accountability, fairness, and everyday accessibility. That means clear, consistent rules; secure systems with verifiable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable backups); regular independent audits with public, plain-language results; and strong cyber and physical security. At the same time, participation should be practical for all eligible citizens through well-staffed polling places, disability accommodations, and reliable options like early voting and secure vote-by-mail where used.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions communicate honestly and respectfully: publish what safeguards exist, what problems occurred (if any), and how they were fixed\u2014without partisan spin. Nonpartisan oversight with observers from multiple viewpoints, accurate voter rolls maintained with due process, and firm consequences for proven misconduct can reinforce accountability while protecting voters from unnecessary barriers. Finally, sustained civics education and multilingual, easy-to-understand information\u2014delivered through schools, community groups, and trusted local leaders\u2014can reduce confusion, counter misinformation, and help people feel confident that the system treats everyone fairly and that their voice matters.",
