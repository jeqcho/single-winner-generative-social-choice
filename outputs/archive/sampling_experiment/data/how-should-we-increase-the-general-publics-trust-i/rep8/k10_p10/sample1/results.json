    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see that rules are fair, outcomes are verifiable, and leaders are accountable regardless of party. We should set clear, consistent standards for security and access: accurate voter rolls with regular, auditable maintenance; secure voting that produces an auditable paper record; routine risk-limiting audits and public incident reporting; and strong cybersecurity with independent testing. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and include bipartisan observers plus trained community members, with strict transparency requirements for funding, procurement, and decision-making. At the same time, institutions must earn trust through plain-language communication, open data dashboards that explain what happened and why, rapid correction of misinformation, and sustained local outreach so every eligible person can participate without intimidation or unnecessary barriers. If people understand the process, can verify the results, and see real consequences for mistakes or misconduct, confidence can rebuild even amid disagreement.",
