    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014rises when people can independently verify that decisions are made fairly, competently, and without special treatment. A practical middle-ground approach is to set clear, consistently applied rules; make key steps observable (e.g., auditable records, transparent chain-of-custody, routine independent audits with publicly released results); and communicate in plain language, on time, and in multiple formats and languages. Institutions should also publish performance metrics, disclose mistakes and fixes quickly, protect privacy and civil rights, and create regular ways for residents\u2014across parties and communities\u2014to ask questions, observe processes, and give feedback. When oversight is real, information is understandable, and services are delivered reliably and respectfully, trust becomes something the public can see and measure rather than just be asked to grant.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on procedures people can see, understand, and verify. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; voter-verified paper records (or equally auditable records); routine independent risk-limiting audits; strong cybersecurity; and clear chain-of-custody rules, with timely public reporting when problems occur and how they\u2019re fixed. Trust also grows when information is plain-language, multilingual where needed, and shared through trusted local partners like schools, libraries, community centers, and faith or civic groups\u2014using simple visuals and open \u201csee-how-it-works\u201d events so families can understand the process together. Finally, we should keep participation practical and fair\u2014accessible polling places, adequate staffing, and reasonable voting options\u2014so security and accountability are strengthened without making it harder for eligible people to take part.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on what people can verify for themselves: clear rules, open processes, and real accountability. That means using auditable records (such as voter-verified paper ballots where feasible), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent audits (including risk-limiting audits) with results published in plain language. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and transparent\u2014inviting observers from across the community, with clear standards for access and conduct\u2014so the public can see how decisions are made and how problems are corrected. Trust also grows when institutions serve everyone respectfully: provide accessible locations and hours, disability accommodations, and information in the languages people use at home, delivered through trusted local partners like schools, libraries, faith groups, and community organizations. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often\u2014sharing timely updates, explaining what is known and unknown, documenting incidents without spin, and correcting misinformation with evidence\u2014so people feel informed, included, and confident that outcomes are fair even when they disagree with them.",
