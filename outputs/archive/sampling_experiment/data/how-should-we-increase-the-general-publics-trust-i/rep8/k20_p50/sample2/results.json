Just as important, institutions should make it easy for the public to participate and verify outcomes\u2014through open meetings and data, accessible services, multilingual communication, and partnerships with trusted local messengers\u2014while investing in staff training and stable funding so systems work reliably.

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially high\u2011stakes public systems like elections\u2014we should focus on practices people can see, understand, and independently verify. That means clear, consistent rules; transparent decision-making; and strong accountability when mistakes happen.\n\nFirst, make outcomes verifiable: use auditable records (such as paper backups where appropriate), routine independent audits, strong cybersecurity, and publicly documented chain-of-custody and quality-control checks. Publish results and audit findings quickly in plain language, including what went wrong (if anything) and how it was fixed.\n\nSecond, make participation fair and accessible: provide clear, step-by-step guidance on how processes work; ensure language access, disability accommodations, and practical options for working families and seniors; and apply rules consistently so people don\u2019t feel the system changes depending on who is voting.\n\nThird, earn trust through local, nonpartisan engagement: adequately fund frontline administrators, train staff and volunteers, welcome bipartisan/community observation, and partner with trusted community anchors\u2014schools, libraries, faith groups, and local organizations\u2014to share accurate information and counter misinformation calmly.\n\nTrust grows when institutions don\u2019t ask for blind faith, but instead demonstrate integrity through transparency, independent verification, equal treatment, and everyday communication that respects the public\u2019s questions.",
