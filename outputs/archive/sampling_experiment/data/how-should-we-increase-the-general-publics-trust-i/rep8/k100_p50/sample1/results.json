    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can verify that rules are fair, decisions are explained, and mistakes are handled openly. A practical middle ground is to set clear, nonpartisan standards that protect both access and integrity: auditable paper records, routine risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and independent oversight with meaningful opportunities for public observation. Institutions should communicate in plain language, publish timely reports on what went right and what didn\u2019t, and show how issues are corrected, rather than relying on slogans or partisan messengers. Finally, sustained local outreach\u2014through schools, libraries, community groups, and multilingual resources\u2014can help people understand how the system works and feel respected, making it easier to accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",

We should run elections as critical infrastructure: use voter\u2011verified paper ballots or auditable paper records everywhere, protect chain of custody, invest in strong cybersecurity, and conduct routine risk\u2011limiting audits with results published promptly in plain language. Oversight should be independent and transparently bipartisan, with meaningful public observation and clear reporting of any problems and how they were fixed. At the same time, we must keep participation straightforward and accessible for every eligible voter through well\u2011staffed polling places, practical early and mail options, disability accommodations, and multilingual materials. Finally, nonpartisan civic education\u2014through schools, libraries, and community \u201copen houses\u201d at election offices\u2014can help families understand how votes are cast and counted, reducing misinformation and strengthening confidence even when outcomes disappoint.",

That means clear, consistent rules; strong privacy and security protections; and independent oversight with routine audits and public reporting so mistakes are found and fixed quickly. Just as important, institutions should communicate in plain language (and multiple languages), use simple visuals and school/library/community-based education, and create safe ways for the public to observe and ask questions. When people can see how decisions are made, confirm the results with evidence, and experience respectful service and equal access, trust grows across different communities and political viewpoints.",
