    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and verify how decisions are made\u2014and when leaders face real consequences for mistakes or misconduct. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity safeguards (clear rules applied consistently, secure records and chain-of-custody, independent audits and inspections, transparent incident reporting, and protections for whistleblowers) with strong accessibility and service (plain-language explanations, multilingual information, disability accommodations, reasonable ways to participate, and respectful customer-service standards for the public). Institutions should publish simple performance metrics, hold regular public briefings and open houses, and invite oversight from a balanced mix of community members and independent experts. When institutions show their work, correct problems openly, and treat everyone fairly, trust can be rebuilt without turning accountability into partisan warfare.",

When people can see the process, verify the safeguards, and get straightforward answers without partisan spin, confidence in institutions can steadily return.",

That means clear, consistent rules; strong protections for privacy and security; and independent checks such as routine audits and public reporting of what worked, what went wrong, and how problems were fixed. Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, use simple visuals that families and students can follow, and partner with trusted local messengers like schools, libraries, community groups, and nonpartisan civic leaders. Trust grows when access is fair and practical for everyone (including working families, seniors, and people with disabilities), when oversight is transparent and not partisan, and when leaders hold themselves accountable through open data, timely updates, and real consequences for misconduct.",
