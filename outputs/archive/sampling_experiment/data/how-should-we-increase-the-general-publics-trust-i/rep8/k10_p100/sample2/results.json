    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions increases when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied consistently, and experience respectful, competent service in their daily lives. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, privacy-protecting safeguards (clear standards, secure recordkeeping, independent audits/inspections, and transparent reporting of mistakes and fixes) with equal, straightforward access to services and information. Institutions should communicate in plain language, publish key data and performance metrics, invite independent oversight and community observation, and enforce real consequences for misconduct\u2014while investing in customer-service training and local partnerships (schools, libraries, faith and community groups) to explain processes, counter misinformation, and listen to feedback. When accountability is visible and participation is fair, trust can be rebuilt across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on rules and systems that are easy for everyday people to see, understand, and verify. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; auditable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable records) with routine risk-limiting post-election audits; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and timely, plain-language public reporting that explains results, discrepancies, and fixes without partisan spin. Trust also depends on fairness and equal access, so voting options and information should be practical for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and communities that need language support, with clear guidance available through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations. When institutions combine strong security with real-world accessibility, independent oversight, and honest communication\u2014even about mistakes\u2014people are more likely to believe outcomes are legitimate and accept them.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should make important decisions easier to see, verify, and understand\u2014while treating every person with dignity and applying the rules consistently. That means setting clear standards, publishing plain\u2011language explanations of how decisions are made, and backing claims with independent checks (audits, inspectors general, or bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight) that the public can review. Institutions should communicate early and honestly\u2014especially when something goes wrong\u2014by sharing what happened, what data supports it, and what changes will prevent it next time. Trust also grows when services are accessible and respectful: information in the languages communities use, accommodations for disability, safe and welcoming public-facing sites, and reliable staffing and funding so systems work as promised. Finally, ongoing civics and community education\u2014through schools, libraries, and local organizations\u2014can reduce misinformation and help families, workers, and seniors feel confident that institutions are accountable, fair, and working for the common good.",
