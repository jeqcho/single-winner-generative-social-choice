    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see clear standards, consistent rules, and real consequences for mistakes\u2014without the process being controlled by any one party or interest. A practical middle ground is to combine strong, verifiable safeguards (auditable records and routine independent reviews, clear chain-of-custody and data protections, transparent incident reporting, and meaningful penalties for proven misconduct) with fair, accessible participation (plain-language, multilingual information; disability accommodations; convenient voting options for working families; and well-trained, well-funded local staff). Institutions should also publish easy-to-read performance dashboards, hold regular public Q&A sessions, and partner with trusted community organizations to explain how decisions are made, what was corrected, and how the public can verify claims. When transparency, accountability, and respectful service are built into everyday operations\u2014not just promises\u2014people are more likely to accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the system easy to verify, easy to understand, and fair to access. That means using auditable records (such as voter-verified paper ballots where feasible), conducting routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits), and publishing clear, plain-language explanations and public reports about how ballots are handled, counted, and certified\u2014along with transparent incident reporting when problems occur and how they are fixed. Trust also grows when oversight is genuinely nonpartisan and open to public observation, and when people can learn the process through practical community education in schools, libraries, and community centers with multilingual materials. By pairing strong security and accountability with respectful, inclusive access and straightforward communication, institutions can earn confidence through visible, consistent performance rather than promises.",

Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and open to bipartisan and community observation, with clear lines of accountability when mistakes happen.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions serve everyone respectfully and accessibly: well-staffed and safe voting locations, reasonable options for working families and seniors, strong disability accommodations, and multilingual information shared through trusted local channels like schools, libraries, community organizations, and faith groups. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often\u2014reporting what protections are in place, what went wrong when problems occur, and how issues are fixed\u2014so misinformation has less room to spread. Strong security plus clear public explanation and equal treatment is the most durable path to rebuilding confidence.",
