    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when institutions make it easy for people to verify that the same fair rules apply to everyone. We should set clear, uniform minimum standards for ballot security and access: auditable paper records, strong chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and transparent reporting of any problems and how they were fixed. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and open to public observation, with meaningful access for bipartisan monitors and trained community members, so accountability isn\u2019t just promised\u2014it\u2019s visible. At the same time, election information should be plain-language, multilingual, and widely shared through schools, libraries, faith groups, and local media, paired with rapid, factual responses to misinformation. If voting is both secure and practical to participate in\u2014and the evidence of integrity is public\u2014more people will accept results even when they disagree with the outcome.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy to verify, easy to understand, and accountable to the public. That means relying on transparent, auditable procedures (like voter-verified paper records and routine risk-limiting audits), strong cybersecurity and secure chain-of-custody, and independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with meaningful public observation. Institutions should communicate in plain language\u2014quickly and honestly\u2014about how processes work, what went wrong (if anything), and how issues were fixed, with timely public reporting. Trust also depends on equal, practical access: well-staffed and accessible locations, flexible voting options, and multilingual materials delivered through schools, libraries, and trusted community partners. When people can see clear rules applied fairly, verify outcomes, and participate without barriers, confidence grows even when results are disappointing.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on steps people can see, understand, and verify. That means clear, uniform rules; nonpartisan administration; secure records people can audit (like paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails); routine, independent post-process audits (including risk-limiting audits) with public, plain-language reports; strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections; and transparent incident reporting when problems occur and how they are fixed. Trust also depends on fair access and equal treatment: convenient and safe ways to participate, well-staffed and welcoming locations, language-accessible materials, and outreach through trusted local partners like schools, libraries, community centers, faith communities, and civic groups. Finally, institutions should consistently counter misinformation by publishing timely facts, open data dashboards, and easy explanations\u2014so families of all backgrounds can judge results based on evidence, not rumors, and feel confident the system works the same for everyone.",
