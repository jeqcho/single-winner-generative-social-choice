    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and get answers from sources they already trust. A practical middle ground is to set clear, consistent standards for ballot handling and cybersecurity while keeping administration local and accountable, then prove performance through voter-verified paper records (or equivalent auditable trails), routine independent audits open to public observation, and timely incident reporting that explains what happened and how it was fixed. Trust also requires respect and access: plain-language, multilingual information; strong privacy protections; reliable staffing and funding for local offices; and multiple secure ways to vote that work for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and rural communities. Finally, partnering with schools, libraries, faith groups, and community organizations for nonpartisan civic education and misinformation response can help people judge results by evidence rather than rumors.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in elections\u2014and in our institutions more broadly\u2014we should focus on practical steps people can see, understand, and independently verify. That means clear, consistent rules; secure voting with voter-verified paper ballots where feasible; routine risk-limiting audits and transparent chain-of-custody; and independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with public observation done respectfully and safely. Just as important, institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, community centers, faith communities), offer accessible options for seniors, people with disabilities, and working families (well-staffed polling places, early voting, and secure mail where appropriate), and respond to misinformation with timely, public reporting and open \u201csee-how-it-works\u201d opportunities. When accountability is visible and participation is treated fairly for everyone, confidence rises\u2014even when outcomes disappoint.",

Trust also grows when access is fair and practical for real life: safe and well-run polling places, options like early voting or secure mail where allowed, disability accommodations, and language support so families can get accurate information in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, and other community languages.
