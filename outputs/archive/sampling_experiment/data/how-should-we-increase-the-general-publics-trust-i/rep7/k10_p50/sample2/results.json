That means clear, consistently applied rules; a reliable paper record or other voter-verifiable trail; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine, independent audits with results explained in plain language. Trust also grows when participation is practical and fair, with accessible polling places and ballot options that accommodate work schedules, disabilities, language needs, and military/overseas voters. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often through trusted local messengers (libraries, schools, community and faith groups), correct mistakes transparently, and hold administrators accountable\u2014so disagreements are handled with evidence and due process rather than partisan accusation.",

Finally, sustained civics education and plain\u2011language, multilingual communication\u2014delivered through trusted local partners like schools, libraries, and community groups\u2014can counter misinformation with facts, show how safeguards work end\u2011to\u2011end, and demonstrate that every eligible voter\u2019s ballot is counted as cast.",

That means using verifiable paper ballots (or an equally auditable paper record), protecting ballot chain-of-custody, and requiring routine independent audits with results published in plain language. Elections should be run by nonpartisan professionals with transparent reporting, strong cybersecurity, and protections for voters and election workers.\n\nTrust also grows when everyone can participate without confusion or barriers. Polling places and voting options should be accessible for seniors, people with disabilities, working families, and eligible voters in every community, with consistent minimum standards across states. Information should be easy to follow and available in English and Spanish (and other needed languages), using simple guides that families and even kids can understand.\n\nFinally, institutions earn trust by communicating calmly and honestly, correcting mistakes openly, and investing in civics and media-literacy education through schools, libraries, and community groups so misinformation has less power. If people can observe the process, verify the safeguards, and get clear answers, confidence rises\u2014even when their preferred side loses.",
