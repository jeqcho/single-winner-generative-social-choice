    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions, we should make how decisions are made and how money is spent easy to see, easy to verify, and easy to question\u2014without needing insider knowledge. That means clear, plain-language explanations of rules and outcomes; independent oversight and regular public audits; strong ethics standards with real consequences for conflicts of interest and misconduct; and open data and records where privacy allows. Institutions should also set measurable service standards (wait times, error rates, responsiveness), report performance publicly, and admit mistakes quickly with a transparent plan to fix them. Finally, trust grows when people feel included: provide information in multiple languages and accessible formats, create meaningful ways for community members to observe, give feedback, and appeal decisions, and protect frontline workers and whistleblowers so accountability is real and not partisan.",

Institutions should apply clear, consistent rules, keep administration nonpartisan and accountable, protect workers and the public from intimidation, and quickly acknowledge and fix mistakes. Trust also rises when access is fair and practical\u2014accessible polling places and clear options like early voting or secure mail voting where used\u2014while ensuring only eligible ballots are counted through reasonable, lawful verification. Finally, institutions should counter misinformation with ongoing public education, open houses/observer opportunities, and simple public reporting so everyday people can understand and verify how decisions and results are produced.",
