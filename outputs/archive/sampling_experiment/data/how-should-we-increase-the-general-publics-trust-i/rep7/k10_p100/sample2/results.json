    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when decisions are made in the open, rules are applied consistently, and people can independently verify that promises match results. Institutions should publish plain-language explanations of how key decisions are made, release timely performance data and audits, and create safe, nonpartisan ways for the public\u2014including journalists, community groups, and ordinary residents\u2014to observe, ask questions, and flag problems. At the same time, agencies must protect privacy and security, enforce clear ethics and conflict-of-interest standards, and respond quickly when mistakes happen\u2014owning them, fixing them, and explaining what changed. Finally, trust improves when services are accessible and respectful to everyone (including multilingual and disability access) and when leaders communicate calmly and factually, reducing misinformation by making accurate information easy to find and understand.",

Trust also grows when access is broad and practical\u2014well-run polling places, secure early and mail options with safeguards, and accommodations for seniors and people with disabilities\u2014so eligible citizens can participate without confusion or barriers.

Trust also grows when institutions communicate early and honestly about problems, publish what changed and why, and hold officials accountable for mistakes or misconduct.
