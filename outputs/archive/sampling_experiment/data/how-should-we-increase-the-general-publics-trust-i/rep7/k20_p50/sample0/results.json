    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014rises when people can see clear rules, consistent performance, and real accountability. A practical middle ground is to set strong, enforceable minimum standards for security and access (such as auditable records, routine independent audits, and documented chain-of-custody) while preserving local administration and public oversight. Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple formats/languages, publish timely results and audit findings, and openly acknowledge and correct errors with a clear process for complaints and review. Finally, investing in nonpartisan civic education, community open houses, and protections for frontline workers can reduce misinformation and help people of all backgrounds feel respected, included, and confident that decisions are made fairly.",

That means auditable paper records (or equivalent verifiable trails), routine independent risk\u2011limiting post\u2011election audits, strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity treated like critical infrastructure, and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with clear accountability for mistakes and how they\u2019re fixed. Trust also grows when institutions communicate in plain language, publish timely and accessible audit findings and results (including multilingual and disability-accessible formats), and create opportunities for the public to observe and learn\u2014through civic education, community briefings, and open houses at local offices\u2014so people rely on evidence rather than rumors. By combining strong safeguards with broad, lawful access and respectful, factual communication, institutions can earn confidence from people across viewpoints, even when outcomes disappoint them.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should pair strong, common-sense safeguards with clear, respectful transparency that people can verify for themselves. That means: nonpartisan administration; auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails); routine, independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where appropriate); strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections; and consistent minimum standards that still allow local control and accountability. Trust also grows when institutions communicate plainly and promptly\u2014publishing easy-to-read results, audit findings, and explanations of any errors and how they were fixed\u2014and when information and assistance are accessible in multiple languages and formats, including for seniors and people with disabilities. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education and community outreach through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, faith and immigrant organizations), while taking misinformation seriously by responding with evidence, openness, and calm professionalism. When people can see the rules, see them applied fairly, and see proof that checks work, confidence can rebuild even when outcomes disappoint some voters.",
