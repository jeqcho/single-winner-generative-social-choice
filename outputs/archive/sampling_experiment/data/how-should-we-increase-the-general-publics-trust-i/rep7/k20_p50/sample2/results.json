    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability regardless of who wins. We should set transparent, uniform standards for how decisions are made and funds are used; publish plain-language, multilingual explanations and data; and use independent oversight (with bipartisan and community representation) to verify outcomes through auditable records, routine public audits, and open observation where privacy is protected. Institutions should also reduce barriers to participation and service, protect frontline workers, respond quickly and honestly to mistakes, and create regular local forums where residents can ask questions, report concerns, and see follow-through. When integrity is visible, access is fair, and leaders communicate facts without spin, trust can be rebuilt across political and cultural divides.",

That means clear, plain-language explanations of how processes work; transparent, consistently applied rules; and independent, bipartisan oversight with routine audits that are publicly reported. Institutions should pair strong security (verifiable records, secure handling of materials and data, and protections for workers and participants) with broad accessibility (safe, convenient options and accommodations for disabilities and language needs). Finally, leaders and officials should communicate promptly and calmly about problems, correct mistakes openly, and invest in ongoing, nonpartisan civic education and community outreach through trusted local partners so misinformation has less room to grow.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy for ordinary people to verify, and easy for every eligible person to access. That means clear, plain-language (and multilingual) explanations of the rules and timelines; transparent public reporting that shows what was done, why it was done, and what data supports it; and independent oversight that is genuinely nonpartisan and accountable. In elections specifically, trust grows when there is a verifiable paper record (or equivalent auditable record), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, routine post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible), and real opportunities for bipartisan observers and community members to watch the process without compromising voter privacy or safety. Institutions should also be responsive: acknowledge problems quickly, fix them publicly, protect frontline workers from threats, and communicate calmly and consistently through trusted local messengers like schools, community groups, faith communities, and healthcare providers. When people can see that rules are applied fairly, information is accessible, and leaders tell the truth even when it\u2019s uncomfortable, confidence and participation rise across communities.",
