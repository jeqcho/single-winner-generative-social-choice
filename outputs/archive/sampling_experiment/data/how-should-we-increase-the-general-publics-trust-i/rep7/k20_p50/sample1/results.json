    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can verify that rules are fair, applied consistently, and enforced without partisan favoritism. A durable middle-ground approach is to pair strong integrity safeguards (auditable paper records or equivalent, routine independent post-election audits, transparent chain-of-custody, and clear standards for voter eligibility) with broad, practical access (well-staffed polling places, accessible options for seniors and people with disabilities, and reliable early/mail voting where used). Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, publish timely explanations when problems occur, invite public observation and community partners to see processes firsthand, and invest in civics/media literacy so misinformation has less room to spread. When institutions are both secure and welcoming\u2014and admit, fix, and report errors openly\u2014people are more likely to accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",

That means clear, consistently applied rules; strong security and privacy protections; auditable records (like paper trails or equivalent); routine independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan audits with publicly posted findings; and transparent handling of mistakes with prompt correction and accountability. Trust also grows when institutions communicate in plain language and multiple languages, proactively counter misinformation with evidence, and invite community participation through observers, open houses, and partnerships with schools, libraries, faith groups, and local civic leaders.
