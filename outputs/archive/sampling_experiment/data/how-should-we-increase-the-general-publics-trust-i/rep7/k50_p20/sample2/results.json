    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see that rules are fair, decisions are explainable, and mistakes are caught and corrected. We should pair strong security and privacy protections (including paper records where feasible, modern cybersecurity, and safeguards for voter data) with independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight and routine, publicly reported audits that verify outcomes without compromising ballot secrecy. At the same time, participation should be practical for eligible voters through accessible voting options, disability accommodations, and clear, multilingual information about how the process works from registration to final certification. Institutions should communicate early and often in plain language, invite community observation and feedback, and enforce consistent standards and accountability for anyone who undermines the process through harassment, corruption, or deliberate deception. Combining transparency, access, and accountable stewardship is the most durable path to rebuilding trust across political and cultural divides.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, verify, and understand how decisions are made, and when the rules apply fairly to everyone. We should pair strong security with radical transparency: paper-backed records where feasible, routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits), and publicly reported results and procedures that ordinary people can follow. At the same time, institutions must remain accessible and inclusive through convenient, lawful participation options, accommodations for disabilities, and plain-language, multilingual information delivered through trusted local partners. Nonpartisan professional administration, consistent standards, robust cybersecurity, and regular public education/open-house style opportunities to observe the process can reduce misinformation and demonstrate accountability\u2014so people feel confident the system is both secure and fair, even when their side loses.",

That means clear, consistent rules that are applied fairly; strong security and privacy protections; and transparent, independent verification (such as paper records where feasible, routine post-election audits like risk-limiting audits, and publicly reported results and procedures that regular people can understand). Trust also grows when access is practical for everyone\u2014seniors, people with disabilities, working families, students, military and overseas voters, and multilingual communities\u2014through options like early voting, accessible polling places, secure ballot tracking, and plain-language information in multiple languages. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and calmly, invite community observation and education (including civics learning), protect frontline workers from harassment, and directly correct misinformation with evidence so people can see how decisions are made and how accountability works\u2014even when outcomes are disappointing.",
