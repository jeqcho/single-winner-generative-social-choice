    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, how money is spent, and what happens when mistakes occur. A practical middle ground is to set clear, publicly posted rules and performance standards; publish plain-language, multilingual explanations of processes and outcomes; and back claims with independently verifiable evidence\u2014such as third-party audits, open data where privacy allows, and regular public reporting that includes both successes and failures. Institutions should create meaningful ways for communities to participate (local forums, citizen oversight panels with diverse membership, and responsive complaint processes), protect equal access and individual rights, and enforce real accountability when leaders or staff break the rules. By pairing transparency with fairness, privacy protections, and consistent follow-through, institutions can earn trust through measurable integrity rather than partisan messaging.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially election administration\u2014we should make the work of government easy to see, easy to verify, and fair to everyone. That means clear, publicly explained rules; strong safeguards like verifiable paper ballots (or auditable records), secure chain-of-custody, and routine independent, bipartisan audits (including risk-limiting audits) with timely public reporting of findings and fixes when errors occur. We should also set uniform minimum security and transparency standards while keeping implementation local and accountable, treating these systems like critical infrastructure with strong cybersecurity and privacy protections. Finally, trust grows when people can participate without unnecessary barriers: accessible polling places and ballot design, reliable vote-by-mail options where used, and plain-language, multilingual voter information and nonpartisan civic education to counter misinformation with calm, factual communication.",
