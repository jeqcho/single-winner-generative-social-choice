    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can verify that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and everyone is treated with equal respect. A practical middle ground is to pair broad access (convenient early and in-person voting, secure mail options, disability accommodations, and enough polling locations) with strong safeguards (paper-based records or auditable trails, routine risk-limiting audits, robust cybersecurity, and clear chain-of-custody standards). Oversight should be independent and transparent\u2014bipartisan where possible and open to public observation\u2014while protecting voter privacy and local administration. Finally, institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages through trusted community partners, publish timely audit results and explanations of any issues, and invest in ongoing civics education so disagreements are resolved with evidence instead of rumors.",

We should use verifiable paper ballots (or auditable paper records), routine independent post\u2011election audits such as risk\u2011limiting audits, strong cybersecurity, and transparent chain\u2011of\u2011custody procedures, with audit results and any problems reported publicly in plain language. At the same time, voting must remain accessible through adequate polling places, early voting, and secure mail options, with disability access and multilingual assistance so every community can participate with confidence. Finally, nonpartisan local administration and ongoing civics and voter education\u2014delivered through trusted community institutions\u2014can reduce misinformation and help the public understand, step by step, how votes are protected, counted, and verified.",

That means clear, consistent rules; secure systems with paper or auditable records; routine independent audits with public, plain-language reports; and strong protections for privacy and cybersecurity. Trust also grows when institutions communicate early and often through nonpartisan, trusted local messengers (schools, community groups, faith leaders, veterans\u2019 and immigrant organizations), provide multilingual and disability-accessible information, and invest in civics education so people understand how the process works from start to finish. Finally, institutions must be accountable: transparent budgets and performance metrics, real consequences for corruption or deliberate disinformation, and regular opportunities for community oversight\u2014so people can see that problems are found, fixed, and prevented.",
