    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections increases when people can both participate easily and verify that outcomes are accurate. We should set clear, consistent baseline standards for security and access\u2014such as auditable paper records, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity practices, and routine independent post-election audits whose results are published in plain language. Election offices should communicate quickly and honestly about problems and fixes, and invite public observation through bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight, open houses, and accessible reporting so communities can see how the process works. At the same time, we should reduce confusion and barriers with practical steps like well-trained poll workers, clear rules, and voting information and materials available in multiple languages and formats, paired with nonpartisan civic education to counter misinformation.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the process easy to observe, easy to understand, and hard to tamper with. That means using auditable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), maintaining secure chain-of-custody, and conducting routine, independent post-election audits such as risk-limiting audits with clear public reporting of results and any fixes. Trust also grows when administration is accountable and nonpartisan: strong training for poll workers, bipartisan/independent oversight, and consistent standards that protect security while respecting state and local realities. Just as important, every eligible voter must be able to participate with confidence through accessible polling places, early and mail voting options where appropriate, and straightforward registration processes\u2014paired with clear, plain-language explanations and materials in multiple languages to reach all communities. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and transparently about mistakes, counter misinformation with verifiable facts, and invite public observation (e.g., open houses or public briefings) so people can see the safeguards in action rather than relying on rumors.",
