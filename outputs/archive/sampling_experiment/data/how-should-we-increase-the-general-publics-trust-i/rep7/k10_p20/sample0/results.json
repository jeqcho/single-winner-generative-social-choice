    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when institutions make it easy for people to see, check, and understand how decisions are made\u2014without requiring them to \u201cjust trust\u201d any party or personality. A practical middle ground is to pair strong security with strong transparency: voter-verified paper records (or equally verifiable backups), routine risk-limiting audits, clear chain-of-custody rules, and public reporting of results and audit findings in plain language. Oversight should be independent and broadly representative (including bipartisan participation, credentialed observers, and community representatives), with consistent minimum standards across jurisdictions while preserving local administration. Just as important, election offices should communicate early and calmly about procedures, errors, and fixes; provide accessible, multilingual materials in common community spaces; protect voter privacy; and create trusted channels to correct misinformation with evidence. By combining verifiable safeguards, fair administration, and respectful public education, institutions can earn confidence across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in elections, we should make the process transparent, verifiable, and consistently administered\u2014so voters of all backgrounds can see how results are produced and checked. This means keeping voter-marked paper ballots (or an equally voter-verifiable record), conducting routine independent risk-limiting audits with bipartisan oversight, and publishing timely, plain-language audit results and explanations of how ballots are counted and protected. We should invest in strong cybersecurity and protections for voter data, while ensuring accessible voting options (including for seniors, people with disabilities, and multilingual communities) and stable funding for local election offices. Finally, election officials and community partners should communicate calmly and nonpartisanly, correct errors openly, and provide clear public education that counters misinformation without partisan spin.",
