    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions like election systems, we should focus on standards people can verify and leaders can be held accountable to: clear rules, transparent decision-making, and independent checks that are communicated in plain language. That means maintaining auditable records (such as paper trails where applicable), conducting routine post-process reviews by qualified, cross-partisan or nonpartisan bodies, publicly reporting results and methods in accessible formats and multiple languages, and responding quickly and respectfully to questions with evidence rather than dismissals. Participation should be secure and reasonably convenient\u2014so eligible people can vote (or use services) without unnecessary barriers\u2014while identity and integrity protections are applied consistently and fairly. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education, local community partnerships, and protections for frontline staff, so the public can see both how the system works and how problems are corrected when they arise.",

That means auditable paper records where feasible, routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits), robust cybersecurity and physical security, and standardized, plain-language public reporting so people can see how decisions are made and how results are confirmed. Trust also grows when participation is accessible and fair: reliable early and mail options where allowed, accessible polling places, multilingual information, and well-funded local administrators who can answer questions quickly. Finally, institutions should proactively counter misinformation with facts, open \u201csee-it-yourself\u201d opportunities (public briefings, office open houses, observer rules that protect privacy), and real accountability for errors or misconduct\u2014so people across viewpoints can conclude the process is secure, inclusive, and worthy of confidence even when their side loses.",
