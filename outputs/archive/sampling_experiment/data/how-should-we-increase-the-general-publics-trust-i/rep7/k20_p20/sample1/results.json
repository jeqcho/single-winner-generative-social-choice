    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see that the rules are clear, the process is fair, and mistakes are found and fixed in the open. A practical middle ground is to set strong, uniform minimum standards for security and transparency while keeping election administration locally accountable: use voter-verifiable ballots (paper where feasible), routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits), and publicly available, plain-language reporting of results, audit findings, and any incidents. Expand access in ways that include sensible safeguards\u2014secure chain-of-custody, accurate voter rolls, trained poll workers, and options that work for seniors, people with disabilities, rural voters, and working families. Pair these protections with nonpartisan, multilingual civic education and community partnerships (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups) so people can ask questions, observe appropriate parts of the process, and get timely factual answers without partisan spin. When transparency, accountability, and equal treatment are built in\u2014and communicated respectfully\u2014more people will accept outcomes even when their preferred side loses.",

That means using voter-verifiable paper ballots (or equivalent auditable records), routine independent risk-limiting audits with publicly posted results, and strong ballot chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections. States should meet clear minimum standards for security and transparency while keeping local, nonpartisan professionals accountable for day-to-day administration. Trust also grows when people can see and understand what\u2019s happening: plain-language, multilingual explanations of voting and counting, timely reporting of problems and fixes, and opportunities for observers and community partners (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups) to ask questions and help counter misinformation.

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make core decisions and results easy for ordinary people to verify, while keeping systems secure, fair, and accessible. That means using reliable, auditable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent voter-verifiable backups), conducting routine independent post-election audits (with bipartisan or nonpartisan oversight), and publishing clear, plain-language reports that show what was checked, what was found, and how problems were fixed. Access must be protected through practical options like early voting and well-run mail voting with strong safeguards, accessible polling places for seniors and people with disabilities, and multilingual information so families who speak Spanish or other languages can fully understand the process. Just as important, institutions should communicate consistently and without partisan spin\u2014openly explaining rules, costs, timelines, and security measures\u2014and work with trusted local partners (schools, libraries, faith and community groups) to answer questions, train frontline staff, and counter misinformation respectfully. When people can see the rules applied consistently, observe or verify key steps, and watch leaders correct mistakes transparently, trust grows\u2014even among those who disagree on politics.",
