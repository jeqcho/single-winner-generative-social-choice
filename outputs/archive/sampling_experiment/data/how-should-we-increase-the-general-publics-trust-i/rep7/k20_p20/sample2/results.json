    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and experience reliable service in their daily lives. A practical middle ground is to set clear, nonpartisan standards for transparency and accountability across institutions: publish plain-language explanations of policies and budgets; make key data, performance metrics, and independent audit findings easy to find; and create strong ethics rules with real consequences for misconduct. Institutions should invite meaningful public oversight\u2014community advisory boards, open meetings, and accessible complaint and appeals processes\u2014while protecting privacy and security. To reach everyone, communication should be timely, multilingual, and delivered through trusted local partners (schools, faith groups, libraries, clinics), alongside civic and media literacy education that helps people distinguish facts from rumors. Finally, institutions must demonstrate fairness through consistent service: reduce barriers for people with disabilities and working families, enforce equal treatment, and regularly report what has improved and what still needs work.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few common-sense commitments: transparency, accountability, and equal access. That means using voting systems that are easy to verify (like paper ballots or voter-verifiable records), requiring routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits), and publishing clear, timely public reports that explain what was checked and what was found. Administration should be professional and nonpartisan, with bipartisan/independent oversight, strong cybersecurity, well-trained poll workers, and stable funding for local officials so rules are applied consistently and competently. Trust also grows when participation is straightforward for every community\u2014through secure early, mail, and in-person options, accessible polling places, language support, and disability accommodations\u2014paired with plain-language civic education and rapid, fact-based responses to misinformation through trusted local messengers. By making the process verifiable, the oversight independent, and the communication clear and inclusive, people can see for themselves that outcomes are fair and that every eligible voter is respected.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared, practical commitments: make decisions and outcomes verifiable, make rules and services consistent and fair, and communicate in plain language to every community.\n\nThat means using secure systems with a clear paper trail where appropriate, requiring regular independent audits with publicly posted results, and setting transparent standards so people don\u2019t feel the rules change from place to place. Institutions should also publish easy-to-read explanations of what they do, how money is spent, how complaints are handled, and how errors are corrected\u2014so accountability is visible, not assumed.\n\nFinally, trust grows through respectful service and real outreach: well-trained frontline staff, accessible options for people with disabilities and busy work schedules, and information available in multiple languages through trusted local partners (schools, faith groups, libraries, community organizations). Pairing transparency and audits with strong civics education and rapid, fact-based responses to misinformation can help people across backgrounds feel confident that institutions are working for the public\u2014honestly, competently, and fairly.",
