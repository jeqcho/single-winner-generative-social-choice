    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make key decisions and outcomes easier to verify, easier to understand, and harder to manipulate, while treating people fairly no matter their politics or background. That means setting clear rules in advance, publishing plain-language explanations of how systems work, and providing public, evidence-based reporting that shows not just what happened, but how it was checked. For elections in particular, trust grows when there is a verifiable record (such as paper ballots or equivalent auditable trails), routine independent audits with publicly posted results, strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections, and meaningful opportunities for bipartisan and community observation that protect voter privacy. Institutions should also reduce barriers to participation\u2014through accessible locations, accommodations for disabilities, multilingual materials, and convenient options\u2014so integrity does not come at the expense of inclusion. Finally, leaders and officials should communicate promptly and calmly, admit mistakes, correct them transparently, and hold anyone\u2014inside or outside government\u2014accountable for proven fraud or deliberate disinformation. When people can see the safeguards, understand the process, and watch problems get fixed openly, trust can rebuild over time.",

Institutions should also apply rules consistently, protect privacy, fund and train frontline staff, and ensure access for seniors, people with disabilities, and multilingual communities.
