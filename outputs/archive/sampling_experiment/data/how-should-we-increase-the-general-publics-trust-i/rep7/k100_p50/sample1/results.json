    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014rises when the public can see that rules are fair, results are verifiable, and leaders are accountable. We should pair strong integrity measures (paper-based records or equivalent auditable trails, secure chain-of-custody, cybersecurity protections, and routine independent post-election audits with publicly posted findings) with broad, practical access for eligible voters (safe in-person options, early and mail voting where offered, accessible polling sites, and clear help for people with disabilities). Institutions should communicate in plain language, in multiple languages, and through trusted local partners, explaining not only what happened but why decisions were made and how errors are corrected. Finally, officials and public figures should be held to consistent standards for honesty\u2014rapidly correcting false claims with evidence\u2014so disagreements stay political while the shared facts about process remain trustworthy.",

That means clear, plain-language explanations of how systems work; consistent, fairly applied rules; and transparent, auditable safeguards such as paper-record backups where feasible, strong cybersecurity and privacy protections, and routine independent, bipartisan audits with results published promptly. Trust also grows when officials communicate calmly and honestly about problems, correct them quickly, and welcome public observation and oversight. Finally, institutions should make participation and access straightforward\u2014through accessible services, multilingual information, and partnerships with trusted local community organizations\u2014while actively countering misinformation with timely, factual, nonpartisan communication.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy for everyday people to verify, not just to be told about. That means clear, consistent rules; transparent processes with auditable records (like paper trails), independent and bipartisan oversight, and routine public audits that explain what was checked, what was found, and how any problems were fixed. Institutions should communicate early and often in plain language, with multilingual and disability-accessible information, so families, immigrants, seniors, and busy working people can understand what\u2019s happening and how to participate. Trust also grows when leaders follow the rule of law, protect staff and the public from threats, admit mistakes promptly, and show measurable improvements over time. By combining strong security and privacy protections with broad, fair access and honest, nonpartisan public education, institutions can rebuild confidence that they serve everyone\u2014not one party or group.",
