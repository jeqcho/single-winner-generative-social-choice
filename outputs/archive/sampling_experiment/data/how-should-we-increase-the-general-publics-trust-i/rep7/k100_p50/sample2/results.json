    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and verify that rules are fair, consistently applied, and enforced without partisan favoritism. A balanced approach is to pair strong integrity safeguards (verifiable paper records or equivalent, routine independent audits with publicly posted results, robust cybersecurity, and clear accountability when problems occur) with broad, practical access (well-staffed and accessible polling places, secure early and mail options, and accommodations for disabilities and work/family schedules). Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, explain decisions before and after they\u2019re made, and invite structured public oversight\u2014such as bipartisan observers, community briefings, and transparent data\u2014so disagreements are resolved with evidence instead of rumor. Over time, consistent service, honest correction of mistakes, and respectful engagement with communities are what turn compliance into confidence.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in elections, we should combine common-sense security with full transparency and equal access. That means using auditable paper records, routine independent post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits), strong cybersecurity, and clear, consistently applied rules for in\u2011person and mail voting that protect ballot privacy while preventing fraud and mistakes. Results and audit findings should be reported in a straightforward, standardized way, with plain\u2011language, multilingual explanations and opportunities for bipartisan and public observation so people can see how problems are identified and fixed. When election offices are well\u2011funded, nonpartisan, and communicate calmly and factually\u2014while actively countering misinformation\u2014more voters across communities can feel confident that every eligible vote is counted as cast.",

That means clear rules that are applied consistently, secure systems with a voter-verifiable paper record (or equivalent auditable record), routine independent audits with results published in plain language, and real accountability when errors occur. Trust also grows when institutions meet people where they are: multilingual and disability-accessible information, well-trained and diverse frontline staff, and partnerships with trusted local messengers (schools, libraries, faith and community groups) to provide nonpartisan education and timely fact-checking against misinformation. When people can participate without unnecessary barriers, see how decisions are made, and verify outcomes for themselves, confidence in institutions increases across communities and political viewpoints.",
