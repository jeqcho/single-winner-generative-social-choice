    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easier for people to verify and harder for any one group to control. That means clear, consistently applied rules; independent oversight with meaningful participation from across the political spectrum and local communities; verifiable records and routine audits; strong cybersecurity and privacy protections; and transparent, timely reporting that includes the underlying procedures and evidence, not just headlines. Trust also grows when institutions communicate plainly, in multiple languages and formats, correct mistakes openly, and partner with trusted community messengers (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups, and local media) so people understand what is happening and why. By combining accessible services with accountable, evidence-based checks, institutions can earn confidence from people who prioritize security, fairness, inclusion, and local control.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in elections, we should focus on a process that is easy to understand, independently verifiable, and administered fairly\u2014so people can see that every eligible vote is counted accurately. This means using auditable paper records, routine risk-limiting post\u2011election audits, strong cybersecurity, and transparent reporting that allows bipartisan and independent observers to check results without compromising ballot privacy. We should pair these safeguards with clear, nonpartisan, plain\u2011language and multilingual voter education\u2014shared through trusted local institutions like schools, libraries, community centers, and healthcare providers\u2014so families and first\u2011time voters know how voting works and how misinformation is addressed. Finally, maintain secure, accessible options such as early voting and trackable mail voting, with consistent rules and accountability, so participation is convenient while the system remains protected from partisan manipulation.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should combine strong safeguards with clear, everyday transparency. That means nonpartisan administration; verifiable records (like paper ballots or voter-verified paper trails); routine, independent audits that the public can observe; and consistent, publicly posted procedures that are followed the same way for everyone. Institutions should communicate early and often in plain language and multiple languages, using simple visuals and community briefings to explain what happens, why it happens, and how problems are handled\u2014without spin or partisan messaging. At the same time, access must be practical and fair: secure in-person and mail options, clear ID and eligibility rules, accommodations for seniors and people with disabilities, and local partnerships with schools, libraries, faith groups, and healthcare providers so people hear information from trusted places. When institutions show their work, admit mistakes, enforce rules evenly, and invite independent verification, people across backgrounds can feel confident the system is both secure and inclusive.",
