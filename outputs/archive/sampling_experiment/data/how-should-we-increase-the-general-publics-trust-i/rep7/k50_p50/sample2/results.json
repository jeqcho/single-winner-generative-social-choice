We should set clear, public standards; strengthen security and privacy protections; and require routine, nonpartisan audits and transparent reporting that explain what was done, what was found, and how problems will be fixed. Institutions should communicate in plain language, in multiple formats and languages, and create real opportunities for community oversight\u2014such as observers, open meetings, and easy-to-use public records\u2014while protecting individuals\u2019 rights.

That means verifiable paper records (or auditable paper trails), routine independent risk-limiting audits with bipartisan oversight, and clear chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards treated like critical infrastructure. Just as important, institutions should publish timely, plain-language reports and public dashboards showing how decisions are made and results are verified, and invite public observation and community \u201copen house\u201d opportunities so people can see the process firsthand. Trust also grows when rules are applied consistently, information is available in multiple languages and accessible formats, misinformation is addressed with evidence and calm communication, and officials are held accountable for honest, nonpartisan administration.",
