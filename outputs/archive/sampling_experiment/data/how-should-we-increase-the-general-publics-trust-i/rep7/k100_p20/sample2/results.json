We should build trust through transparency people can verify (clear procedures, public reporting, and independent audits), strong safeguards for security and privacy (cyber protections, secure records, and documented chain-of-custody), and broad, practical access so eligible people can participate without unnecessary barriers. Institutions should communicate in plain language, in multiple formats and languages, respond quickly to concerns with evidence, and partner with trusted local messengers to reduce misinformation. When institutions consistently show competence, integrity, and respect for every community, trust becomes earned rather than demanded.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in elections\u2014and in the institutions that rely on them\u2014we should make the process easy to verify, hard to tamper with, and fair to access for every eligible voter. That means clear nationwide baseline standards with strong local transparency: secure chain-of-custody procedures, auditable paper records where feasible, routine independent risk-limiting audits, and public reporting of results and audit findings in plain language. We should pair these safeguards with practical accessibility (including options for seniors, people with disabilities, and language access), protect ballot secrecy, and keep election administration nonpartisan and accountable. Finally, trust grows when concerns are addressed respectfully with evidence, civic education is strengthened, and deliberate misinformation and intimidation of election workers are confronted so communities can see problems identified and fixed quickly.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on three shared priorities: transparency people can see, accountability people can verify, and access that treats everyone fairly. That means clear rules that are applied consistently; secure, auditable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent voter-verifiable records) with strong chain-of-custody; routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible) with results published in plain language; and strong cybersecurity and protections for personal data. Trust also grows when information is easy to understand and available in the languages communities use, when voting and public services are accessible to seniors and people with disabilities, and when local, nonpartisan administrators provide open explanations and timely updates. Finally, institutions should address mistakes quickly and publicly, protect frontline workers from harassment, and counter misinformation with evidence-based communication through trusted community messengers\u2014so people across backgrounds can see the process is fair, problems are corrected, and outcomes are earned.",
