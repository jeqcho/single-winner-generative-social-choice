    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014rises when people can see that rules are fair, processes are consistent, and mistakes are caught and corrected. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, privacy-protecting security (e.g., paper records where appropriate, tested technology, and regular independent audits) with clear, plain-language public explanations of what happened and why decisions were made. Institutions should publish understandable performance metrics, disclose conflicts of interest, invite bipartisan and community observation, and provide easy ways to report problems and get timely answers. Finally, sustained investment in frontline staff, customer-service level responsiveness, and nonpartisan civic education\u2014delivered through trusted local partners and in multiple languages\u2014can reduce misinformation and help people feel respected, heard, and confident that the system works for everyone.",

That means secure, auditable processes (like paper ballots where feasible, strong chain-of-custody, and routine risk-limiting post-election audits) with independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight and clear public reporting. Trust also increases when institutions communicate consistently in plain, multilingual language, protect privacy and ballot secrecy, invest in cybersecurity and well-funded local administration, and provide accessible options such as early voting, safe in-person voting, and secure mail voting. Finally, sustained, nonpartisan civic education and partnerships with trusted community organizations can counter misinformation and help people feel respected, heard, and confident that outcomes are legitimate.",

That means clear rules applied consistently, strong privacy protections, secure records (like paper backups where appropriate), and routine independent audits with plain-language public reports about what was checked and what was found. Institutions should communicate early and often in nonpartisan, multilingual ways (including Spanish and English), partner with trusted local groups like schools, libraries, and community centers, and make participation practical through accessible locations, accommodations for disabilities, and convenient options that reduce barriers. Finally, trust grows when leaders are honest about mistakes, correct them transparently, and push back on deliberate misinformation with facts that the public can see and confirm.",
