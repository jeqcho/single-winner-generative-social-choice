    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when decisions are made in ways people can see, verify, and challenge fairly. We should set clear, consistent rules; keep strong, auditable records (such as paper backups where appropriate); and use independent, routine audits with results published in plain language and accessible formats. Institutions should be professionally run and insulated from partisan pressure while remaining accountable through bipartisan/community oversight, open data where privacy allows, and responsive complaint and review processes. At the same time, we should strengthen access and equal treatment for all eligible participants, invest in straightforward public education, and work with trusted local messengers to counter misinformation without silencing legitimate questions. The goal is simple: processes that are secure, fair, and understandable enough that people with different views can still accept the outcome.",

We should use transparent, verifiable processes (such as paper records or auditable systems), conduct regular independent risk-limiting audits, and publish understandable results and audit findings so anyone can check the basics. Institutions should be run by nonpartisan professionals with bipartisan/public oversight, strong cybersecurity and privacy protections, and clear, plain-language explanations of how systems work. Finally, trust requires real access and respectful communication: reliable options for participation, accommodations for disabilities and working families, and proactive community-based education to counter misinformation through trusted local messengers.",

That means setting clear rules, publishing plain-language explanations (in English and Spanish) of what is being done and why, and sharing timely data people can verify. Institutions should use strong, independent oversight (including bipartisan/nonpartisan audits, ethics enforcement, and protections for whistleblowers), with real consequences for fraud, waste, and abuse. People should be able to participate through accessible public meetings, local advisory boards, and trusted community partners like schools, faith groups, libraries, unions, and small businesses, so concerns are heard early and answered with facts rather than spin. Finally, institutions must deliver basic competence\u2014safe systems, good customer service, and consistent treatment\u2014because transparency plus performance is what earns lasting trust.",
