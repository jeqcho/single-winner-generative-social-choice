    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and get timely answers when something goes wrong. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, auditable safeguards (clear standards, documented chain-of-custody for records, independent inspections and audits, and public reporting of results and corrections) with broad, real-world accessibility (straightforward processes, accommodations for disabilities, multilingual information, and options that work for varied schedules). Institutions should communicate in plain language, publish the data and reasoning behind major decisions, protect privacy, and invite accountable oversight from multiple perspectives\u2014community members, nonpartisan experts, and bipartisan observers\u2014so concerns are handled transparently rather than dismissed. Over time, consistent performance, visible accountability for mistakes or misconduct, and respectful, fact-based engagement are what rebuild confidence across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections rises when the system is built to be verifiable, transparent, and accessible\u2014so people don\u2019t have to take outcomes on faith. We should use paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records) as the standard, conduct routine risk-limiting post\u2011election audits with publicly posted results, and maintain strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity protections from casting to certification. Oversight should be independent and bipartisan, with clear rules for observation and prompt, public explanations and corrections when issues arise. At the same time, voting should remain practical for working families and all eligible voters through secure early and mail options, disability accommodations, and clear, multilingual, plain\u2011language information about how ballots are counted and verified. By combining strong safeguards with straightforward communication and civic education that counters misinformation, we can make election outcomes easier to understand, easier to check, and harder to doubt\u2014regardless of which side wins.",

We should make decisions and outcomes verifiable (publish plain-language standards, budgets, and performance measures; use independent audits and public reporting; protect whistleblowers), and we should communicate early and often with calm, factual updates that correct mistakes quickly. Institutions also need to be accessible: provide information and services in the languages people actually use, offer flexible hours and multiple ways to get help (online, phone, in-person), and ensure disability access and respectful treatment for every resident. Finally, trust grows when oversight is local and diverse\u2014community advisory boards, bipartisan/nonpartisan review where relevant, and partnerships with schools, libraries, and community and faith organizations\u2014so people can ask questions, observe how decisions are made, and confirm that rules apply equally to everyone.",
