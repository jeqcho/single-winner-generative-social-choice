We should set clear standards for transparency\u2014plain-language explanations of policies, budgets, data sources, and decision timelines\u2014paired with independent oversight, regular audits, and strong protections for privacy and civil liberties. Institutions should publish performance measures (including mistakes and corrective actions), enforce conflict-of-interest rules, and create accessible ways for the public to ask questions and appeal decisions. Just as important, institutions must treat communities with respect: provide information in multiple languages and formats, ensure services are accessible to people with disabilities, engage local and bipartisan/community partners, and respond quickly to misinformation with evidence and sources. By combining verifiable safeguards, open communication, and consistent, fair service for everyone, trust can be rebuilt over time across different backgrounds and political views.",

We should prioritize transparent, nonpartisan administration from registration through counting by using verifiable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), strong chain-of-custody protections, and routine independent post-election audits such as risk-limiting audits. Bipartisan and community oversight should be welcomed through clear observer rules that protect voter privacy and safety. Institutions must communicate procedures and results early and plainly\u2014using simple, accessible, multilingual materials\u2014so the public understands what safeguards exist and how concerns are addressed. Finally, sustained civics education, rapid fact-based responses to misinformation, robust cybersecurity, and adequate staffing and funding help ensure every eligible voter can participate and every valid vote is counted accurately and transparently.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on practices people can see, verify, and understand, regardless of party or background. That means using paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records wherever possible, maintaining strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and conducting routine, independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results published promptly. Oversight should be genuinely bipartisan and include trained observers from different communities, with clear rules that protect both transparency and voter privacy.\n\nTrust also depends on communication and service. Institutions should explain processes and outcomes in plain language, share data and audit findings openly, and correct misinformation quickly with evidence\u2014not insults. Information should be accessible in multiple languages (including Spanish) and in formats that work for people with disabilities. Finally, governments should fund and staff offices adequately and apply rules consistently, so that wait times, access options (like early voting where available), and problem resolution are dependable. When institutions are transparent, accountable, secure, and respectful to the public they serve, confidence can grow over time.",
