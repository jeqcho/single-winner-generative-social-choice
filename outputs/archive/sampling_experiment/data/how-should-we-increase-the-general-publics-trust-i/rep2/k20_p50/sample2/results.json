    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on practices people can see, check, and understand, regardless of party, background, or language. That starts with transparent, verifiable systems: paper ballots (or an equivalent voter-verifiable record), strict chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine independent post\u2011election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results published openly in plain language. Institutions should communicate early and often through trusted local channels\u2014schools, libraries, workplaces, community groups, faith communities, local media\u2014and provide multilingual, disability-accessible information so everyone can follow the rules, timelines, and safeguards.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions are accountable and service-oriented: consistent and fairly applied rules, clear ways to ask questions or report problems, prompt corrections when mistakes happen, and protections for privacy and safety of both voters and workers. Finally, reduce rumor and polarization by investing in nonpartisan civic education and reliable public dashboards that explain what happened and why, so people can judge evidence over rhetoric. When institutions prioritize transparency, accessibility, and independent verification\u2014and treat the public with respect\u2014more people are willing to accept outcomes, even when they disagree with them.",
