    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify outcomes, and experience fair, respectful service regardless of politics or background. A practical middle ground is to set clear, public standards for integrity (strong recordkeeping, conflict-of-interest rules, cybersecurity, and enforceable penalties for fraud or abuse), require independent oversight and routine audits with publicly released, plain-language findings, and make participation and access straightforward through reliable services, accommodations, and multilingual communication. Institutions should proactively share timely data, admit and correct mistakes, and create regular channels for community input\u2014so accountability is real, misinformation has less room to spread, and people feel the system is both secure and responsive.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the rules are clear, applied consistently, and the results can be independently verified by ordinary citizens\u2014not just experts or partisans. We should use voting systems with verifiable paper ballots (or an equivalent voter\u2011verifiable paper record), protect ballot secrecy, and conduct routine risk\u2011limiting audits with transparent chain\u2011of\u2011custody and open, bipartisan/nonpartisan observation. Election offices should publish plain\u2011language, multilingual explanations of how voting, counting, audits, and certification work\u2014along with timely, accessible public data\u2014so people can see what happened and why the outcome is credible. At the same time, we should make voting practical for eligible voters through secure access options (reasonable hours, early voting, disability accommodations, and well\u2011run polling places) and maintain accurate voter rolls with clear, fair procedures. Finally, sustained civic education and calm, fact\u2011based communication to correct mistakes and counter misinformation can rebuild confidence without partisan hype while respecting both security and participation.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make key decisions and outcomes easy to verify, clearly explained, and fairly administered no matter who is in power. That means (1) transparency people can see: public, plain\u2011language explanations of how decisions are made, how money is spent, and how results are reached; (2) verifiable accountability: independent, nonpartisan audits and oversight with publicly posted findings, clear timelines for certification, and real consequences for fraud, corruption, or abuse; (3) strong security and privacy: modern cybersecurity, secure chain\u2011of\u2011custody, and systems with paper trails or equivalent records that protect ballot secrecy and personal data; (4) equal and practical access: straightforward rules, well\u2011staffed offices, disability and language accommodations, and reasonable options to participate (such as early voting or secure mail options where used), so the process works for working families, students, seniors, and people on the move; and (5) consistent, local-facing communication: trusted community channels\u2014schools, libraries, community centers, and local media\u2014sharing the same factual information and quickly correcting misinformation without partisan attacks. When institutions operate with clear rules, independent checks, and respectful communication, people don\u2019t have to rely on slogans\u2014they can see the evidence that the system is fair and working for everyone.",
