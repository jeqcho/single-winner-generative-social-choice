    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can both see that the rules are fair and verify that the results are accurate. A practical middle ground is to standardize clear, consistent procedures across states while keeping local administration accountable and open to public observation: use verifiable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), maintain transparent chain-of-custody logs, run routine risk-limiting audits with publicly posted methods and results, and invite bipartisan and independent observers. At the same time, protect ballot secrecy, strengthen cybersecurity, and enforce meaningful penalties for proven misconduct. Trust also depends on access and understanding\u2014provide predictable voting options (in-person, early, and secure absentee where appropriate), ensure disability and language accommodations, and communicate in plain, nonpartisan terms through trusted local channels so voters can confidently assess facts and resist misinformation.",

We should standardize clear, consistent rules; use verifiable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records) with routine risk-limiting audits; maintain transparent chain-of-custody and robust cybersecurity; and ensure independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan local oversight with public reporting in plain language. At the same time, expand practical access\u2014accessible polling places and equipment for voters with disabilities, reasonable early and mail options with secure verification, and multilingual voter information\u2014so participation is both secure and straightforward.

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on procedures people can see, verify, and understand, regardless of party or background. That means using voter-verifiable paper ballots (or auditable paper trails), routine risk-limiting post-election audits, strong cybersecurity, and strict chain-of-custody documentation that is publicly reportable without compromising voter privacy. Administration should be transparent and locally accountable, with bipartisan and independent oversight, clear standards for certification, and real consequences for proven misconduct.\n\nTrust also depends on fairness and access: consistent rules that are applied equally, reasonable options to vote (in-person, early, and secure absentee/mail where used), accessible polling places and disability accommodations, and language access\u2014including clear multilingual guidance\u2014so every eligible voter can participate without confusion or undue barriers.\n\nFinally, institutions should communicate calmly and nonpartisanly: publish plain-language explanations of how systems work, share timely evidence-based updates, and invest in civics and media literacy so communities\u2014especially young people and historically underserved groups\u2014can evaluate claims and see how outcomes are confirmed. Verifiable safeguards + equal access + clear communication is the most durable path to rebuilding trust.",
