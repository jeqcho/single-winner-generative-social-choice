A durable middle ground is to pair broad, lawful access to participation with strong verification: a voter-verified paper record, transparent chain-of-custody, routine independent post-election audits, and publicly reported security practices and incident responses that protect privacy. Institutions should communicate decisions and results in plain, multilingual language, correct misinformation with evidence rather than rhetoric, and invite community observation and feedback through nonpartisan oversight, open meetings, and clear avenues for complaints and appeals. Consistent standards, adequate funding for professional administration, and equal treatment across communities help ensure everyone can participate with confidence and that outcomes are accepted as legitimate.",

We should use transparent, consistently applied, nonpartisan procedures; maintain verifiable paper records where possible; and conduct routine independent post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) with clear public reporting. Institutions should also invest in strong cyber and physical security, adequate staffing and funding, and plain\u2011language, multilingual communication that explains how decisions are made and how the public can verify results. Finally, expanding safe, accessible participation (e.g., accessible polling places, early voting, and secure mail options where used) and partnering with trusted community groups for nonpartisan civic education can reduce misinformation and help every eligible person feel respected and confident in the outcome.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in our institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can clearly see that rules are fair, services are reliable, and leaders are accountable. We should commit to transparent, nonpartisan decision-making with publicly explained standards; strong protections against corruption and conflicts of interest; and regular independent oversight that shares results in plain language. For elections specifically, that means secure, auditable voting (such as paper or voter-verifiable records), routine independent post\u2011election audits, consistent procedures, and timely reporting of problems and fixes\u2014while also making participation practical through accessible polling places, reasonable options like early or mail voting where secure, and accommodations for people with disabilities, work constraints, or health barriers. Institutions should communicate early and often in clear, multilingual formats (including Spanish), protect privacy, and partner with trusted local groups\u2014schools, libraries, faith and community organizations\u2014to provide nonpartisan civic education and help people verify information and spot misinformation. When people can both participate easily and verify that systems work as promised, trust can be earned and sustained.",
