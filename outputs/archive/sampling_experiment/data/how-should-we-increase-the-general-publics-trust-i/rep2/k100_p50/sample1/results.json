    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real consequences for mistakes, without anyone having to rely on partisan claims. We should use voting systems that are verifiable and privacy-protecting (such as paper records with routine, publicly reported post-election audits), maintain transparent chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and ensure independent oversight that includes representation from multiple parties and the community. At the same time, voting should be practical and accessible for eligible citizens through well-run polling places, reasonable early and mail options, disability accommodations, and language access. Finally, institutions must communicate in plain language, publish understandable data and audit results, and respond quickly and calmly to misinformation and errors\u2014so trust is earned through observable performance, not slogans.",

That means using paper ballots (or paper-backed records), routine post-election risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and nonpartisan, locally accountable administration with bipartisan/independent observers.

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on things people can verify for themselves: transparent rules, consistent enforcement, and clear accountability when mistakes happen. That means paper-backed ballots (or equally auditable records), routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and nonpartisan, professionally trained local administrators with bipartisan and community observation.\n\nTrust also depends on being treated with respect and being able to understand the process. Institutions should publish plain-language, multilingual explanations of how decisions are made and how results are checked; hold open community briefings through schools, libraries, faith and civic groups; and provide timely, calm updates\u2014especially when rumors spread\u2014along with public evidence and corrections.\n\nFinally, fairness and access must be real, not just promised: reasonable early voting and safe mail options where used, accessible polling places and disability accommodations, adequate staffing to reduce long lines, and equal application of rules. When institutions make their work visible, verifiable, inclusive, and consistently enforced, people don\u2019t have to rely on slogans\u2014they can rely on proof.",
