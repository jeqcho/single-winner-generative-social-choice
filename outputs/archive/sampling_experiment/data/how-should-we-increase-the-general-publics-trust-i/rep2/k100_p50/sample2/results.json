    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections and other democratic institutions grows when people can see, understand, and independently verify that rules are applied fairly\u2014without advantaging any party or community. A practical middle-ground approach is to pair broad access with visible safeguards: use voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent), conduct routine risk-limiting audits and publish the results in plain language, maintain strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and ensure bipartisan and nonpartisan oversight with clear ways for the public to observe and ask questions. At the same time, institutions should communicate early and calmly, correct errors transparently, and partner with schools, libraries, faith groups, and local community organizations to provide multilingual, nonpartisan civic information that helps people judge evidence over rumor. With steady funding, professional administration, and consistent accountability, citizens can participate confidently and accept outcomes even when they disagree with the result.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in our elections, we should make the process easy to see, easy to verify, and easy to understand\u2014no matter who you are or where you live. That means using verifiable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), conducting routine independent post-election audits such as risk-limiting audits, and maintaining strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections. Election offices should be adequately funded, staffed by trained nonpartisan professionals, and overseen with bipartisan and community observation that is transparent and free from political pressure. Just as important, officials, schools, libraries, faith communities, and local organizations should provide plain-language, multilingual (including Spanish) explanations of how voting, counting, and certification work, plus clear ways for voters to ask questions, report issues, and see how concerns are investigated. By combining visible safeguards, fair access for all eligible voters, and calm, fact-based communication that corrects misinformation quickly, we can help more Americans accept results with confidence\u2014even when their preferred candidate loses.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on visible fairness, consistent rules, and everyday accountability that people can understand and verify for themselves. That means using verifiable voting records (such as paper ballots or paper backups), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent audits (including risk-limiting audits) with results posted publicly in plain language. Institutions should communicate early and often through trusted local messengers\u2014election officials, schools, libraries, faith and community groups, and local media\u2014using multilingual information (including Spanish and other common languages) and clear ways for residents to ask questions, report concerns, and see how issues are resolved. At the same time, we should protect ballot privacy, ensure respectful treatment of every voter, and make participation practical for working families (reliable polling places, reasonable hours, and secure options such as early voting and mail where available). Trust grows when institutions are transparent, professionally run, adequately funded, open to bipartisan and community observation, and willing to correct mistakes quickly and publicly\u2014so people can judge evidence over rumor and accept results even when they disagree with the outcome.",
