    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and independently check how decisions are made and corrected. A practical middle ground is to standardize core safeguards nationwide while keeping local administration accountable: verifiable voting records (paper ballots or equivalent), routine risk-limiting audits with publicly posted results, clear chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and transparent processes for investigating complaints and fixing errors. At the same time, participation must be realistic for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and multilingual communities through accessible polling places, reasonable early and absentee options with secure verification, and plain-language information in multiple formats. Finally, institutions should earn credibility by communicating calmly and quickly, admitting mistakes, protecting privacy, supporting frontline workers, and partnering with trusted local groups (schools, libraries, faith and civic organizations) for nonpartisan civic education and misinformation rebuttal.",
