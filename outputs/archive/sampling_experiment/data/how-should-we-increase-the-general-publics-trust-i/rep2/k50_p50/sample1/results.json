    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is rebuilt when rules are clear, performance is measurable, and accountability is real\u2014regardless of who is in power. We should make core processes more transparent and independently verifiable (routine public reporting, third\u2011party audits, and open data where privacy allows), set consistent service standards, and create straightforward ways for people to track decisions, file complaints, and see how problems are fixed. Institutions should communicate early and plainly about what they know, what they don\u2019t, and how they\u2019re improving, with rapid corrections when mistakes occur. Just as important, everyday access must be fair: services should be easy to use, available in multiple languages and formats, and designed so working people, seniors, people with disabilities, and rural communities can participate without barriers. Partnering with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, faith groups, community organizations, and independent media\u2014can help explain procedures and counter misinformation without partisan framing. Trust won\u2019t come from slogans; it comes from consistent competence, visible oversight, and respectful treatment of the public.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the process is secure, transparent, and easy for ordinary people to verify and understand\u2014no matter their politics. We should use voter-verifiable paper ballots (or paper backups) with routine risk-limiting post\u2011election audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and well-funded, well-trained election staff. Administration and oversight should be nonpartisan and accountable, with bipartisan observation and clear procedures that are applied consistently. Just as important, voters deserve timely public reporting and plain-language, multilingual explanations of how ballots are cast, counted, audited, and certified\u2014plus accessible voting options (such as early voting and secure, trackable mail ballots) and accommodations for people with disabilities. By pairing firm, verifiable safeguards with equal access and calm, fact-based communication that corrects misinformation quickly, we can show that every eligible vote is protected and counted fairly.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the work visible, and the results independently checkable, while treating every person with dignity. That means using verifiable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper backups), routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where appropriate), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and nonpartisan professional administration with bipartisan and community observation so people can see safeguards in action. Trust also depends on fairness and access: consistent, well-publicized procedures; convenient options like early voting and secure mail voting with trackable status; adequate staffing and polling locations to reduce long lines; and full accessibility for voters with disabilities. Finally, institutions and media should communicate calmly and transparently\u2014publishing plain-language, multilingual explanations of how decisions are made, what went wrong (if anything), and how it was fixed\u2014while supporting civic education, protecting privacy, and responding quickly to misinformation with verifiable facts. When people can participate easily and verify outcomes without having to \u201ctake someone\u2019s word for it,\u201d trust can grow across communities and political views.",
