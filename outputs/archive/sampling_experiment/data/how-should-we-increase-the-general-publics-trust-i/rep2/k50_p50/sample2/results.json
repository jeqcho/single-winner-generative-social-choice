    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are followed, and get honest answers when things go wrong. Institutions should publish clear, plain-language explanations of their goals, budgets, and performance; open key data and meeting records; and use independent oversight\u2014audits, inspections, and bipartisan/nonpartisan review panels\u2014whose findings are public and acted on. Leaders must consistently enforce conflict-of-interest rules, protect whistleblowers, and respond to mistakes with fast corrections and visible improvements rather than defensiveness. Just as important, institutions should make participation practical and respectful: accessible services, multilingual communication, community partnerships, and clear ways to appeal decisions. When transparency, accountability, and everyday fairness are built into the system\u2014not dependent on who is in charge\u2014people across viewpoints have stronger reasons to trust it.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can see\u2014step by step\u2014that voting is secure, fair, and accessible, regardless of party or background. We should use verifiable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), routine independent risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with publicly posted standards and audit results. Election offices should communicate early and often in plain language\u2014through local newspapers, schools, libraries, and community partners\u2014with multilingual and disability-accessible materials that explain how ballots are cast, counted, reviewed, and certified, and how questions or errors are handled. By pairing rigorous verification with practical access (reasonable polling hours, early voting and secure mail options where used, and well-trained poll workers), we can reduce misinformation, improve understanding, and build durable confidence that outcomes reflect the will of the voters.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on practices people can see, verify, and understand, regardless of politics or background. That means clear, consistent rules; transparent chain-of-custody and recordkeeping; verifiable paper records where feasible; routine independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits); strong cybersecurity; and timely public reporting of results, corrections, and how concerns are investigated. Trust also grows when participation is realistic for working families and people with disabilities: accessible polling places, reasonable hours, secure early and mail options where allowed, and straightforward help for voters who need it. Finally, institutions must communicate calmly and nonpartisanly in plain language\u2014through local newspapers, schools, libraries, and trusted community partners\u2014with materials available in the languages people actually use (including Spanish) and with visual, easy-to-follow guides. When institutions combine accountable safeguards with respectful service and clear information, people can judge evidence over rumor and feel confident that decisions are made fairly and every eligible voice is counted.",
