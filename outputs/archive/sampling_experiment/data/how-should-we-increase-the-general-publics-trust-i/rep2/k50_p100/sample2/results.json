    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify the results, and experience fair, consistent treatment\u2014no matter their politics or background. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, checkable safeguards (clear rules, documented procedures, independent inspections/audits, and public reporting of outcomes and corrections) with real accessibility (plain-language explanations, multilingual and disability accommodations, and services that work for people with demanding schedules). Institutions should publish the data and standards behind major decisions, explain tradeoffs openly, protect privacy, and create clear channels for questions, complaints, and whistleblowing\u2014along with consequences for proven misconduct. Finally, rebuilding trust requires ongoing two-way engagement through local partners (schools, libraries, community and faith groups, and independent media) so people get timely facts, can observe oversight in action, and feel respected even when they disagree with the outcome.",

Administration should be professional and nonpartisan, with meaningful bipartisan and public observation, clear timelines for reporting and certification, and rapid, factual explanations when problems occur. At the same time, trust requires broad, practical access: safe early and in\u2011person voting, secure mail options where used, disability accommodations, and multilingual voter information delivered through trusted local channels like schools, libraries, community organizations, and faith groups.
