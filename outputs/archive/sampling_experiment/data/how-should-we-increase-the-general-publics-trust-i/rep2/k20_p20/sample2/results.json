    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are followed, and experience fair treatment in practice. We should set clear, consistent standards; publish plain-language explanations of procedures, data, and results; and invite independent, cross-partisan and community-based oversight with strong conflict-of-interest rules. Institutions should pair security and integrity safeguards (documented records, regular audits, and protections against fraud or abuse) with equal access and respectful service (language and disability accommodations, multiple ways to participate, and responsive help lines). Finally, leaders must earn trust through accountability\u2014promptly correcting mistakes, enforcing consequences for wrongdoing, protecting workers from harassment, and communicating early and often to counter misinformation without silencing legitimate questions.",

That means using transparent, auditable processes (such as paper records where feasible, secure chain-of-custody, and independent post-election or post-decision audits), strong cybersecurity and physical security, and nonpartisan professional administration with oversight that includes people from different perspectives. Trust also grows when the public can observe what\u2019s happening: timely public reporting, plain-language summaries of methods and findings, and clear steps for correcting errors. Institutions should protect both integrity and access by keeping services usable for working families, people with disabilities, and communities that speak different languages\u2014paired with practical civic education and straightforward, fact-checked information to reduce misinformation. When rules are clear, enforcement is fair, and accountability is visible, people are more likely to believe outcomes are legitimate even when they disagree with them.",

That means using transparent, auditable procedures (such as paper records where feasible, secure chain-of-custody, and routine independent post-process audits), with bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight and publicly available reports that show what was checked, what was found, and how any issues were fixed. Trust also grows when access is fair and practical: safe voting options, disability accommodations, and straightforward help at the local level, alongside accurate voter-roll maintenance and clear rules that are enforced the same way for everyone. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often in plain language and multiple languages, partner with trusted community messengers (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups), protect workers from threats, and respond to misinformation with timely, evidence-based information so people can see that the system is both secure and inclusive.",
