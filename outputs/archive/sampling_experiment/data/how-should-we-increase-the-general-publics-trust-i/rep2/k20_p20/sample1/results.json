We should strengthen transparency and accountability with clear standards, independent oversight, auditable records (such as paper-backed systems where relevant), and routine public reporting that explains what happened and why in plain language. At the same time, institutions must make participation and services accessible\u2014through reasonable options and accommodations, multilingual information, well-trained staff, and consistent application of the rules\u2014so no community feels shut out. Finally, officials and community partners should respond quickly to misinformation and mistakes with evidence, clear timelines, and visible corrective actions, because trust is earned through openness, competence, and follow-through.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when the rules are clear, the work is professional and nonpartisan, and the results are verifiable by the public. We should use voting systems with paper records, strict chain-of-custody, strong cyber and physical security, and routine independent risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language. Administration should be transparent and accountable, with bipartisan or cross-partisan oversight, well-trained staff, and a straightforward process for reporting concerns and seeing how they are investigated. Trust also requires fair access: accessible polling places, reasonable early and mail options, and multilingual information so every eligible voter can participate without confusion. Finally, sustained, nonpartisan civic education and timely, fact-based communication from trusted local officials and community leaders can reduce misinformation and help people understand\u2014and therefore trust\u2014how decisions are made.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on making decisions and results easy to verify, clearly explained, and applied fairly to everyone. That means transparent rules that stay consistent, nonpartisan and professional administration, and simple public reporting that shows what was done and why. For elections specifically, use paper-backed voting with strong chain-of-custody, routine independent risk-limiting audits, and strong cybersecurity, with audit results and incident reports published in plain language.\n\nTrust also grows when participation is respectful and accessible: safe early and Election Day options, secure mail voting where offered, reasonable wait times, disability access, and reliable language access (including Spanish) so families can understand the process without confusion. Finally, institutions should communicate proactively through trusted local messengers (schools, community leaders, healthcare workers), teach basic civics, and provide clear ways to ask questions and report concerns\u2014so people don\u2019t have to \u201ctake it on faith\u201d and can see accountability in action.",
