    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and independently verify that rules are applied fairly and consistently. A practical middle ground is to combine strong security with broad access: use auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), conduct routine risk-limiting audits and publish clear chain-of-custody and testing reports, and ensure oversight that is genuinely bipartisan and includes respected local community observers. Institutions should communicate early and often in plain language\u2014using multiple languages and accessible formats\u2014explaining what is known, what is still being checked, and how disputes are resolved, without partisan messaging. Finally, investing in well-trained frontline staff, consistent standards, and civic education\u2014while protecting privacy and free speech\u2014helps reduce confusion, counter rumors with verifiable facts, and demonstrate day-to-day competence that earns confidence over time.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when the rules are fair, the work is transparent, and ordinary people can verify results without relying on partisan claims. We should standardize secure, auditable voting across jurisdictions by using paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), maintaining strong chain-of-custody procedures, and conducting routine risk-limiting audits with bipartisan and independent oversight. Election offices should publish clear, plain-language explanations of how ballots are cast, counted, audited, and certified\u2014along with timely reporting of discrepancies and how they were resolved\u2014so the process is understandable to non-experts.\n\nTrust also requires inclusive access: reliable polling locations, secure early and mail options where offered, and strong disability and language accommodations, delivered through nonpartisan community outreach. Finally, we should invest in civics education, transparent cybersecurity and technology standards (including independent testing and open reporting), and well-supported election workers, while countering misinformation with consistent, evidence-based public information. The goal is a system that is secure and accessible, locally accountable yet consistently verifiable, and worthy of confidence no matter who wins.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the process observable, and the results independently verifiable, while keeping participation accessible for every eligible person. That means using paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records, maintaining strict chain-of-custody documentation, and conducting routine risk-limiting audits with bipartisan and independent oversight so the public can confirm outcomes without relying on anyone\u2019s word.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions communicate plainly and consistently: publish simple, nonpartisan explanations of how decisions are made, how votes are counted and certified, and what safeguards are in place\u2014along with timely reporting when problems occur and how they are fixed. Information should be available in plain language and multiple languages, with disability accommodations, and shared through trusted local channels (schools, community groups, libraries, and local media).\n\nFinally, we should invest in the people and infrastructure that make integrity possible: well-trained, protected frontline workers; strong cybersecurity and privacy protections; transparent performance metrics; and steady funding that supports uniform, evidence-based standards. Trust isn\u2019t created by slogans\u2014it\u2019s earned through procedures that ordinary residents can inspect, understand, and see applied fairly to everyone.",
