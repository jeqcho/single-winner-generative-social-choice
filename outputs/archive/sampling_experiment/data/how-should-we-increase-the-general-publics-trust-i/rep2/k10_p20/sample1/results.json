    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can both participate without unnecessary barriers and independently verify that the rules are followed and votes are counted as cast. A practical middle ground is to set clear, consistent baseline standards across states\u2014secure voter registration and list maintenance with regular public reporting; identity verification that is strong but not exclusionary (including free IDs and multiple acceptable documents); and voting systems that produce a voter-verifiable paper record with rigorous, routine risk-limiting audits. Chain-of-custody procedures, bipartisan and independent observers, and timely, plain-language explanations of results and audits\u2014shared through local officials, libraries, schools, and community partners in multiple languages\u2014should be the norm. With stable funding for trained poll workers, accessible in-person and mail/early options that include strong tracking and safeguards, and firm consequences for proven misconduct, we can protect security, privacy, and equal voice while reducing the space for misinformation to erode confidence.",

We should use transparent, paper-backed voting systems with strict chain-of-custody and routine risk-limiting post\u2011election audits; publish clear, timely, plain\u2011language explanations of procedures and results; and ensure bipartisan and independent oversight that is locally accountable. At the same time, we should invest in well-trained, nonpartisan administrators, strong cybersecurity, and stable funding for local offices so safeguards are consistently applied. Trust also requires access and inclusion: reasonable voting options (including early and secure absentee/mail where allowed), accommodations for voters with disabilities, and multilingual voter information delivered through trusted community channels. By pairing verifiable security with understandable communication and practical accessibility, we make it harder for misinformation and bad-faith claims to take hold and easier for the public to have confidence in the outcome.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few clear principles people across backgrounds can see working: transparency, independent verification, fair access, and consistent communication. That means using verifiable voting systems (paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records), strict chain-of-custody, and routine risk-limiting audits that are publicly reported in plain language. It also means professional, nonpartisan administration with bipartisan observation, stable funding for local officials and poll-worker training, strong cybersecurity for voter rolls and tabulation systems, and real accountability for proven misconduct.\n\nTrust also depends on everyday experience: voting should be convenient and secure for people with demanding schedules, disabilities, and language needs. Expand early voting and well-run absentee options with clear identity and ballot-verification steps, while ensuring enough polling places, reasonable hours, and accessible facilities. Finally, partner with schools, libraries, employers, and trusted community groups to provide nonpartisan, multilingual voter education and rapid, factual updates during counting and recounts. When people can understand the rules, watch the safeguards, and verify the checks themselves, confidence in outcomes\u2014and in the institutions that manage them\u2014goes up.",
