Institutions should set transparent standards, publish the data and reasoning behind major decisions, and invite independent review\u2014through audits, inspectors general, ombuds offices, and citizen panels chosen to reflect the community. Services must be delivered fairly and consistently, with simple multilingual communication, accessible ways to ask questions or file complaints, and firm protections for privacy and civil liberties. Finally, institutions should show accountability with measurable goals, regular performance reporting, and real consequences for misconduct or corruption, so people can see that integrity is rewarded and failures are corrected rather than hidden.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make outcomes easy for ordinary people to verify and hard for anyone to manipulate. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration with verifiable paper ballots (or equivalent auditable records), strong chain-of-custody procedures, robust cybersecurity, and routine independent risk-limiting audits with publicly posted results. Trust also depends on clear, timely, plain-language explanations of how decisions are made and how problems are investigated and resolved, shared through local media and trusted community partners in multiple languages. Finally, institutions must remain accessible and fair\u2014well-funded, well-staffed, and accountable\u2014so every eligible person can participate, privacy is protected, and independent observers and citizens can see that rules are applied consistently.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on what people can see, verify, and understand. That means clear, nonpartisan rules and transparent administration at the local level; secure, auditable systems with verifiable paper records or equivalent safeguards; routine independent risk-limiting audits; and strict chain-of-custody procedures with public reporting of how issues are handled and resolved. Trust also grows when access is fair and practical: reliable polling locations, reasonable early and mail voting options where available, strong accessibility for people with disabilities, and voter assistance in plain language and multiple languages. Institutions should partner with trusted community groups, schools, and local media to explain processes, correct errors quickly, and counter misinformation with timely facts\u2014while protecting voter privacy and welcoming bipartisan and citizen observation so the public can confirm outcomes with confidence, even when their preferred side loses.",
