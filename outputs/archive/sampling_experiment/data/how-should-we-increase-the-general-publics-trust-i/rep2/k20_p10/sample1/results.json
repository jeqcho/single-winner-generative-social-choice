    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and verify that the rules are fair, applied consistently, and enforced with real accountability. A durable middle ground is to pair broad access with strong, transparent safeguards: paper records (or voter-verifiable paper trails) for every vote, routine independent audits with public results, clear chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and enforceable penalties for proven misconduct\u2014while also making participation straightforward through accurate voter rolls, accessible registration and voting options, and well-trained, adequately funded administrators. Institutions should communicate early and often in plain language and multiple languages, publish timely explanations of decisions and results, invite meaningful nonpartisan observation, and create trusted local channels (schools, libraries, community groups) for questions and fact-checking. When systems are both secure and welcoming\u2014and when leaders model honesty about what is known, what isn\u2019t, and how issues are corrected\u2014confidence rises across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make processes easy to see, check, and understand. That means using verifiable paper records, routine independent post\u2011process audits (e.g., risk\u2011limiting audits) with results published in plain language, and strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody plus cyber-physical security so people know records are protected from tampering. Transparency should include clear, timely explanations of how decisions and results are reached, what went wrong when problems occur, and how they were fixed, with consistent standards applied fairly everywhere.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions meet people where they are: provide accessible, multilingual information; partner with locally trusted community organizations; and ensure participation is straightforward and secure (e.g., user-friendly registration and voting options) while protecting privacy. Finally, sustained civic education and support for frontline public workers help reduce misinformation, improve service quality, and demonstrate accountability over time.",

That means: clear, plain-language explanations of rules and outcomes; publicly available data and independent audits where feasible; consistent, fairly enforced standards; strong protections against corruption, fraud, and cyber threats; and real accountability when systems fail. Institutions should communicate through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, community and faith groups), provide accessible information across languages and disability needs, and create simple ways for residents to ask questions, report problems, and get timely responses. Finally, rebuilding trust requires investing in professional staff, training, and customer-service standards so people experience institutions as competent, respectful, and focused on the public interest rather than politics.",
