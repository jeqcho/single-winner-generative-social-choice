      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to competent, consistent service delivery. People who emphasize reform deserve clear oversight, open data, and consequences for misconduct, while those who value stability deserve institutions that can do their work without constant political interference. A practical middle ground is to strengthen independent audits, citizen feedback channels, and plain-language communication, while also investing in staff capacity and fair, predictable rules so institutions perform reliably for everyone.",
      "Building public trust in institutions should focus on both stronger accountability and better performance: clear standards, transparent decision-making, independent oversight, and real consequences for misconduct. At the same time, institutions should communicate with the public in plain language, invite meaningful participation, and show measurable results on shared priorities like safety, fairness, and economic opportunity. This approach recognizes concerns about corruption or bias while also valuing the stability and expertise institutions can provide when they earn legitimacy through openness and consistent service.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with reliable delivery of essential services. People who value stability deserve institutions that function effectively, while skeptics deserve clear evidence\u2014through open data, independent oversight, and enforceable consequences\u2014that power isn\u2019t being abused. Creating meaningful opportunities for community input and regular performance reporting can help institutions earn trust through consistent results rather than demanding it by default.",
      "Public trust in institutions can be strengthened by combining greater transparency and accountability with a commitment to delivering reliable, fair results that people can see in their daily lives. While some emphasize reform and oversight and others stress stability and expertise, both perspectives can align around clear standards, independent audits, and open communication that explains decisions and admits mistakes. Institutions should also create meaningful ways for communities to participate and give feedback, so trust is earned through both performance and responsiveness.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to effective, reliable service delivery. This means making decisions and data easier to scrutinize, creating independent oversight and clear consequences for misconduct, and ensuring institutions respond quickly and fairly to people\u2019s real concerns. At the same time, we should protect institutions from undue political or financial influence so they can act consistently and competently. Building trust is less about messaging and more about earning credibility through measurable performance, open processes, and respectful engagement with the public."
