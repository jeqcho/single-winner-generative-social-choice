      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a practical commitment to reliable, effective service. People who worry about corruption or bias deserve clear information, independent oversight, and consequences for failures, while those who value institutional stability need reforms that preserve capacity and expertise. Building trust also requires consistent two-way engagement\u2014listening to communities, explaining decisions in plain language, and measuring results publicly\u2014so confidence is earned through performance rather than assumed.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a fair recognition of the essential services institutions provide. This means making decision-making and funding more open, setting clear performance standards, and enforcing consequences for misconduct, while also investing in competence and consistent service delivery. At the same time, institutions should engage communities through regular consultation and independent oversight so people can see how concerns are heard and how improvements are made.",
      "Public trust in institutions can grow when they are both effective at delivering results and accountable to the people they serve. We can balance concerns about overreach with the need for competent governance by increasing transparency, strengthening independent oversight, and making decision-making and data easier to understand and verify. At the same time, institutions should engage communities directly, admit and correct mistakes promptly, and enforce fair, consistent standards so trust is earned through visible performance rather than demanded.",
      "Increasing public trust in institutions requires both stronger performance and clearer accountability: institutions should deliver reliable services while being transparent about decisions, data, and mistakes. At the same time, reforms should invite meaningful public participation\u2014through independent oversight, open communication, and accessible channels for feedback\u2014without undermining expertise or the rule of law. Trust can grow when institutions consistently treat people fairly, correct problems promptly, and demonstrate that they serve the public interest rather than partisan or private agendas.",
      "Public trust in institutions can grow when they consistently deliver fair, effective outcomes while being transparent about decisions, limits, and mistakes. Those who emphasize accountability can be met with strong oversight, clear performance measures, and meaningful consequences for misconduct, while those who value institutional stability can be reassured through predictable rules and professional standards. Creating accessible channels for public input and independent review\u2014without turning every decision into partisan conflict\u2014helps institutions earn credibility over time."
