      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger accountability and transparency with a commitment to fair, effective service delivery. That means clearly explaining decisions and tradeoffs, measuring outcomes in ways people can verify, and enforcing consequences for misconduct, while also avoiding blanket cynicism that undermines necessary public functions. Building trust will require ongoing two-way engagement\u2014listening to communities, including critics, and making visible improvements\u2014so confidence is earned through consistent performance and integrity rather than demanded.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with reliable service that people can see and measure in their daily lives. Those who worry about overreach deserve clear limits, independent oversight, and open data, while those who value stability need institutions that are adequately resourced and insulated from partisan swings. A practical middle ground is to set shared performance standards, communicate decisions and trade-offs plainly, and create meaningful channels for community input and redress when institutions fall short.",
      "Increasing public trust in institutions requires both stronger accountability and more respectful engagement with the people they serve. Institutions should be transparent about decisions and outcomes, admit mistakes, and create independent oversight, while also investing in consistent, fair service delivery that demonstrates competence. At the same time, the public and leaders across viewpoints can support trust by demanding evidence, rejecting misinformation, and participating in constructive feedback channels that improve performance rather than simply polarize debate.",
      "Public trust in institutions is best strengthened by pairing clear accountability with meaningful competence: institutions should be transparent about decisions and data, admit mistakes, and face independent oversight, while also delivering reliable services that improve people\u2019s lives. At the same time, the public\u2019s concerns about inefficiency or bias can be addressed through fair processes, open participation, and protections against corruption or political capture. A practical middle ground is to focus on measurable outcomes, regular audits, and accessible channels for feedback so trust is earned through consistent performance rather than demanded by authority.",
      "Public trust in institutions grows when they consistently deliver fair, effective outcomes and are transparent about how decisions are made. We can balance concerns about overreach with the need for competent governance by strengthening independent oversight, clear accountability, and open access to information while protecting privacy and due process. Institutions should actively engage communities\u2014including critics\u2014and use measurable performance standards so trust is earned through demonstrated integrity, responsiveness, and results."
