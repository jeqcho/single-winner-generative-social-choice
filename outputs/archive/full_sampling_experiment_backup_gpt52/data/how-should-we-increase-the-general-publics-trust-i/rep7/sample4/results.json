      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to effective, consistent service. People who want reform deserve clear information about decisions, independent oversight, and real consequences for misconduct, while those who value stability need institutions that can act decisively and deliver results. Building trust also requires regular, respectful engagement with communities\u2014listening to concerns, explaining tradeoffs, and measuring performance in ways the public can verify.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to delivering reliable, fair services that improve people\u2019s daily lives. Those who emphasize institutional stability can support clear standards, independent oversight, and consistent communication, while those who are skeptical can be met with real avenues for feedback, protections for whistleblowers, and consequences for misconduct. Rebuilding trust will require both better performance and more open, participatory decision-making so institutions are seen as competent, responsive, and worthy of confidence.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with reliable, effective service delivery. People who worry about corruption and bias deserve clearer oversight, open data where feasible, and meaningful consequences for misconduct, while those concerned about stability and capacity deserve reforms that support competent staff and consistent funding. Building trust will require ongoing public input, independent evaluation of results, and communication that is honest about tradeoffs and mistakes as well as successes.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a clear recognition that institutions are essential for delivering services, protecting rights, and managing complex risks. That means making decisions and data easier to scrutinize, setting real consequences for misconduct, and creating reliable ways for people to give input and see how it affects outcomes. At the same time, reforms should avoid blanket distrust by investing in competence, fair and consistent enforcement, and everyday service improvements that people can directly experience.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with consistent, competent service delivery that people can see and measure. Those who worry about overreach deserve clearer rules, independent oversight, and avenues to challenge decisions, while those who value effective governance need institutions that can act decisively in the public interest. A practical middle ground is to set shared, measurable standards for performance and integrity, expand public participation and open data, and enforce consequences for misconduct without politicizing the process."
