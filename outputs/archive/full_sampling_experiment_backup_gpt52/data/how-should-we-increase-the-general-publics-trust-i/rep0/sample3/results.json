      "Building public trust in institutions requires both improved performance and greater transparency: institutions must deliver results people can see while openly explaining how decisions are made. Those who emphasize accountability can support stronger oversight, clear metrics, and consequences for misconduct, while those who value institutional stability can support reforms that protect independence from partisan swings. A practical middle ground is to expand public participation, publish accessible data, and invest in consistent, respectful service\u2014so trust is earned through demonstrated fairness, competence, and openness over time.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and independent accountability with a commitment to effective, reliable service delivery. People who worry about overreach deserve clear rules, open data, and real consequences for misconduct, while those who value public capacity deserve stable funding and professional standards that make institutions work well. Building regular, two-way engagement with communities\u2014and measuring performance publicly\u2014can help align institutional decisions with shared goals and lived realities.",
      "Public trust in institutions can be strengthened by pairing higher transparency and accountability with a practical recognition of the constraints institutions face. That means making decisions and data easier to understand, setting clear standards and independent oversight, and correcting mistakes quickly while protecting due process and frontline capacity. At the same time, investing in consistent service delivery and creating regular channels for public input can help institutions earn trust through both performance and responsiveness.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair strong accountability with practical support for the people and communities institutions serve. Those who emphasize transparency and oversight can agree on clearer metrics, independent audits, and meaningful consequences for misconduct, while those who worry about politicization can support consistent rules and due process applied evenly. At the same time, institutions should communicate plainly, invite public input, and deliver reliable services so trust is earned through both openness and performance.",
      "Public trust in institutions can grow when institutions consistently demonstrate integrity, competence, and fairness while being open about mistakes and how they are corrected. People who want stronger institutions and those who fear unaccountable power can agree on clearer transparency, independent oversight, and meaningful ways for the public to participate in decisions. Pairing these reforms with reliable service delivery and equal treatment under the rules helps ensure accountability without weakening institutions\u2019 ability to function effectively."
