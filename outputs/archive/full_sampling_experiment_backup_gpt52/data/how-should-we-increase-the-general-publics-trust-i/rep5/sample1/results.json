      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to effective, nonpartisan service. People who worry about corruption deserve clearer reporting, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct, while those who value stability deserve well-resourced institutions that can deliver reliable results. Building trust also means creating regular channels for public input and feedback, so institutions can learn from mistakes, explain tradeoffs honestly, and show measurable improvements over time.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair higher transparency and accountability with a commitment to competent, consistent service delivery. People who worry about corruption and concentrated power deserve clear oversight, open data, and meaningful consequences for misconduct, while those who value stability and expertise deserve well-resourced institutions that can reliably do their jobs. Building trust also requires regular, respectful public engagement\u2014including independent audits, accessible communication, and community input\u2014so institutions both perform well and earn legitimacy.",
      "Increasing public trust in institutions requires pairing stronger accountability with genuine responsiveness to people\u2019s everyday experiences. Institutions should be transparent about decisions and outcomes, enforce clear ethical standards, and welcome independent oversight, while also listening to criticism and improving services without dismissing concerns as misinformation. At the same time, the public and media can support trust by demanding evidence, engaging in good-faith scrutiny, and recognizing progress when institutions correct mistakes.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with better support for the people and systems that deliver essential services. Those who emphasize reform are right that clear standards, independent oversight, and consequences for failures are necessary, while those who worry about instability are right that institutions also need consistent resources and protection from politicized interference to perform reliably. A balanced approach is to publish understandable performance data, invite meaningful public participation, and focus on fair, consistent results so trust can be earned over time rather than demanded.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to reliable, fair service delivery. People who worry about corruption and unresponsiveness deserve clearer oversight, open data, and consequences for misconduct, while those concerned about stability and expertise are right that institutions must retain the capacity to make decisions based on evidence. Building trust will require consistent performance, independent audits, and meaningful public participation so institutions are both competent and answerable to the communities they serve."
