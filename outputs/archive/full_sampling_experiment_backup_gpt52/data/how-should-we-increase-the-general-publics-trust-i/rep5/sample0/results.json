      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a clear commitment to competent, fair service. That means making decisions and data easier to understand, inviting independent oversight and community input, and correcting mistakes openly, while also protecting institutions from undue political pressure so they can do their jobs. By combining measurable performance, ethical safeguards, and meaningful public engagement, we can address skepticism without weakening the essential roles institutions play.",
      "Public trust in institutions can be strengthened by pairing stronger transparency and accountability with reliable, competent delivery of essential services. Institutions should publish clear data on decisions and outcomes, invite independent oversight, and create meaningful channels for public input, while also protecting due process and stability from politicized swings. This approach respects skepticism about concentrated power while recognizing that effective institutions are necessary for public safety, health, and economic opportunity.",
      "Public trust in institutions can grow when institutions reliably deliver results while being transparent about how decisions are made and who benefits. People who emphasize accountability are right to demand clear standards, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct, and those who worry about overcorrection are right that rules should protect effectiveness and due process. A practical middle ground is to pair measurable service improvements with open data, plain-language communication, and meaningful public input, so trust is earned through performance, fairness, and honesty over time.",
      "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a recognition that many institutions still provide essential services that need stable support. This means clear standards for ethics and performance, open data and communication about decisions and tradeoffs, and independent oversight with real consequences for misconduct\u2014without turning every mistake into a reason to dismantle capacity. At the same time, institutions should actively listen to communities, reduce barriers to participation, and deliver measurable results, so trust is earned through both integrity and effectiveness.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a genuine commitment to effective, fair service. People who are skeptical want clear evidence that mistakes are acknowledged, conflicts of interest are managed, and leaders face consequences, while others want to protect institutions\u2019 ability to make informed decisions without constant politicized pressure. A workable middle ground is to set measurable performance standards, open key processes and data to public scrutiny, and create independent oversight and accessible channels for feedback so institutions can earn trust through consistent results."
