      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to competent, consistent service delivery. People who value stability need institutions that can act effectively in crises, while skeptics need clear oversight, accessible data, and consequences for misconduct. A practical middle ground is to improve open communication, independent audits, and community participation in decision-making, so institutions are both reliable and answerable to the public they serve.",
      "Public trust in institutions can grow when they earn credibility through consistent results, clear rules, and honest accountability, rather than expecting deference. People who value stability and expertise and those who worry about elitism or corruption can agree on practical reforms like transparent decision-making, independent oversight, and meaningful consequences for failures. At the same time, institutions should invite regular public input and communicate evidence and trade-offs plainly, so legitimacy comes from both competence and responsiveness.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a recognition that these institutions often provide essential services that need stability to function well. Reforms can focus on clear standards, independent oversight, and open data so people can see how decisions are made and how mistakes are addressed, while also investing in frontline capacity and fair treatment across communities. At the same time, institutions should create consistent channels for public participation and feedback, so trust is earned through demonstrated competence, responsiveness, and integrity rather than demanded by authority.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair strong performance with genuine transparency: clearly explain decisions, publish data and outcomes, and admit mistakes when they happen. At the same time, institutions should be held accountable through independent oversight, fair enforcement of rules, and meaningful opportunities for public input, especially from communities that feel overlooked. This approach respects concerns about corruption or bias while also recognizing that effective institutions are essential for delivering services, protecting rights, and solving shared problems.",
      "Public trust in institutions grows when they consistently deliver fair results and are transparent about how decisions are made and mistakes are corrected. A balanced approach combines stronger accountability\u2014clear standards, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct\u2014with meaningful public engagement that listens to communities and explains tradeoffs honestly. This protects institutions from both unchecked power and reflexive cynicism, while focusing reforms on measurable improvements that people can see in their daily lives."
