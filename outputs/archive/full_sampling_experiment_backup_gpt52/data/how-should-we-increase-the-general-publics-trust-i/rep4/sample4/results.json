      "Trust in institutions can grow when they are both effective and accountable: delivering reliable services while being transparent about decisions, data, and mistakes. People who worry about overreach and those who worry about dysfunction can agree on stronger oversight, clear ethical rules, and meaningful public input that makes institutions answerable without paralyzing them. Investing in integrity measures\u2014independent audits, anti-corruption enforcement, and open communication\u2014can rebuild confidence while respecting legitimate skepticism and diverse community needs.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and accountability with practical improvements in service and outcomes people can see in their daily lives. This means clearer communication about decisions and trade-offs, independent oversight and consequences for misconduct, and meaningful opportunities for community input\u2014without undermining the expertise and stability institutions need to function. By setting measurable standards, reporting progress openly, and treating people consistently and fairly, institutions can earn trust across political and social divides.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger accountability and transparency with a commitment to competent, consistent service delivery. People who want reform deserve clear oversight, open data, and consequences for misconduct, while those who value stability need institutions that can function effectively without constant politicization. Building trust means creating independent checks, improving communication and responsiveness, and engaging communities in decision-making so institutions earn legitimacy through both integrity and results.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with reliable delivery of essential services, recognizing that some people primarily want better outcomes while others prioritize fair process and oversight. Institutions can earn confidence by clearly explaining decisions, publishing data and audits, enforcing consequences for misconduct, and creating meaningful channels for public input. At the same time, reforms should protect institutional independence and expertise so long-term commitments are stable and decisions remain evidence-based rather than purely political.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger accountability and transparency with respect for the important roles these institutions play in providing stability and services. That means setting clear standards, openly sharing data and decision rationales, and enforcing consequences for misconduct, while also investing in professional capacity and fair, consistent processes. Trust can grow when people have meaningful ways to participate and give feedback, and when institutions demonstrate\u2014through measurable results\u2014that they learn from mistakes and treat communities equitably."
