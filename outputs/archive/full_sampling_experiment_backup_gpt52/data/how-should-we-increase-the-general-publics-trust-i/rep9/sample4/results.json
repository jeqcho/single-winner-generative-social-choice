      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to competent, consistent service delivery. This means openly sharing how decisions are made, measuring outcomes, and enforcing consequences for misconduct, while also ensuring institutions have the resources and independence needed to do their jobs effectively. By inviting meaningful public input and communicating trade-offs honestly\u2014without politicizing core functions\u2014we can address skepticism while preserving the stability and expertise that institutions provide.",
      "Trust in institutions can grow when they pair strong performance with clear accountability\u2014delivering essential services reliably while being transparent about decisions, data, and tradeoffs. People who favor reform want safeguards against abuse, and people who value stability want institutions that can function effectively; both goals are served by independent oversight, fair enforcement of rules, and meaningful public input. By improving integrity and responsiveness without undermining capacity, institutions can earn confidence across political and cultural divides.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair greater transparency and accountability with consistent, reliable delivery of essential services. People who value stability and expertise can support strong professional standards, while those skeptical of power can be assured by independent oversight, open data where feasible, and clear consequences for misconduct. Trust grows when institutions listen to communities, explain decisions plainly, and measure success by outcomes the public can verify.",
      "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should pair greater transparency and accountability with fair, consistent delivery of services that people can see and measure. Those who worry about overreach deserve strong checks, open data, and independent oversight, while those who value effective governance need institutions that are adequately resourced and able to act. Building trust means listening to communities, admitting mistakes, enforcing consequences for misconduct, and regularly reporting progress against clear standards.",
      "Public trust in institutions can grow when those institutions are both effective and visibly accountable. We can balance calls for stronger oversight with concerns about politicization by setting clear performance standards, increasing transparency, and ensuring independent audits and fair enforcement. At the same time, institutions should engage communities, communicate uncertainty honestly, and deliver tangible results so people see that rules and resources serve the public interest rather than insiders."
