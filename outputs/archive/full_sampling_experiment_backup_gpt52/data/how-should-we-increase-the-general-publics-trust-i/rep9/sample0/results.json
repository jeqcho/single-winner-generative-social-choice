      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a practical recognition that many institutions also deliver essential services and stability. That means clearer standards for ethics and performance, independent oversight, and open data where possible, alongside reforms that reduce politicization and improve competence. Trust can\u2019t be demanded; it\u2019s earned through consistent results, fair treatment, and meaningful opportunities for the public to participate and be heard.",
      "Building greater public trust in institutions should combine stronger accountability with better engagement, recognizing that some people want reform while others worry about undermining essential services. Institutions can earn confidence by being transparent about decisions and data, enforcing clear ethics rules with real consequences, and making it easier for the public to see how feedback changes outcomes. At the same time, citizens, media, and leaders can support trust by evaluating evidence fairly and keeping criticism focused on improvement rather than cynicism, so institutions remain both effective and answerable.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair strong accountability with practical support for the people those institutions serve. That means more transparency about decisions and results, real consequences for misconduct, and clear channels for public input\u2014while also investing in competent, independent oversight and frontline services so institutions can deliver reliably. By focusing on both integrity and performance, we can respect skepticism without undermining the shared systems that protect rights and solve collective problems.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair higher transparency and accountability with a genuine commitment to effective, reliable service. People who worry about overreach deserve clear limits, independent oversight, and open data, while those who prioritize strong public capacity deserve institutions that are well-resourced and able to deliver results. A pragmatic consensus is to make decision-making more visible, invite meaningful public participation, and measure outcomes openly\u2014so trust is earned through both fairness and performance.",
      "Public trust in institutions can grow when they consistently deliver results while being transparent about how decisions are made and how mistakes are corrected. Those who prioritize accountability can be met with stronger oversight, clear performance metrics, and meaningful consequences for misconduct, while those who worry about overreach can be assured by due process, independent review, and public participation. Investing in clear communication, open data where feasible, and equitable service delivery can help institutions earn trust through both integrity and competence."
