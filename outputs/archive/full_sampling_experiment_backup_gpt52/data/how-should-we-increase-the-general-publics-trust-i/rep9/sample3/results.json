      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with consistent, competent delivery of services people rely on. Those who worry about overreach deserve clear limits on institutional power, accessible oversight, and consequences for misconduct, while those who emphasize collective problem-solving need well-funded, professional institutions that can act effectively. Building trust requires open data, independent audits, meaningful public participation, and fair enforcement of rules\u2014so institutions earn legitimacy through both integrity and results.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with better performance on the outcomes people experience day to day. Those who worry about overreach can be assured by clear limits, independent oversight, and open data, while those who value strong public services can support investing in capacity and professionalism. Building trust requires consistent, measurable results and meaningful opportunities for the public to participate, give feedback, and see how decisions are made and corrected when mistakes occur.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine greater transparency and accountability with reliable, effective service delivery. That means clear standards, independent oversight, and open communication about decisions and tradeoffs, while also addressing concerns about bias, inefficiency, and unequal treatment. At the same time, institutions need the stability and resources to do their jobs well, and the public should have meaningful, ongoing ways to give input and see how it influences outcomes.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to competent, consistent delivery of essential services. People who worry about misuse of power deserve clear oversight, open data, and real consequences for wrongdoing, while those who value stability and expertise need institutions protected from misinformation and politicized interference. Building trust also means regular two-way engagement\u2014listening to communities, explaining decisions in plain language, and showing measurable progress over time.",
      "Public trust in institutions grows when they reliably deliver fair, effective outcomes and are transparent about how decisions are made and mistakes are corrected. We can respect concerns about overreach and bureaucracy while also recognizing that strong institutions are necessary for public safety, economic stability, and equal treatment. A practical middle path is to strengthen accountability\u2014clear standards, independent oversight, open data where appropriate\u2014and pair it with meaningful public participation so institutions remain both competent and responsive."
