      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with consistent delivery of services people can see and measure. Those who worry about overreach can be reassured by clear limits on power, independent oversight, and open data, while those who want more effective institutions can support investments in competence, integrity, and responsiveness. Building regular channels for community input and fair, timely correction of mistakes can help institutions earn trust through performance rather than demands for deference.",
      "Public trust in institutions grows when they are both effective and accountable: delivering reliable services while being transparent about decisions, data, and mistakes. We can respect concerns about overreach by strengthening checks and balances, independent oversight, and clear avenues for appeal, while also recognizing that well-resourced institutions are necessary to solve shared problems. Building trust requires consistent standards\u2014anti-corruption enforcement, fair treatment, and measurable outcomes\u2014combined with genuine public engagement so people can see how their input shapes policy.",
      "Building public trust in institutions should focus less on messaging and more on consistent performance: clear rules, competent delivery of services, and fair treatment. People who emphasize accountability can be met with strong transparency, independent oversight, and real consequences for misconduct, while those concerned about stability can be reassured by protecting institutional independence from partisan swings. Trust grows when institutions regularly explain decisions in plain language, invite community input, and show measurable improvements over time.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair greater transparency and accountability with reforms that make services more effective and responsive to people\u2019s everyday needs. Those who worry about corruption and unchecked power deserve clear oversight, open data, and consequences for misconduct, while those who value stability and expertise deserve well-resourced institutions protected from partisan interference. Building trust means setting measurable standards, listening to communities, and showing\u2014through consistent results\u2014that institutions serve everyone fairly.",
      "Increasing public trust in institutions requires both better performance and greater openness: institutions should consistently deliver fair, effective services while making decisions, data, and tradeoffs transparent. At the same time, accountability should be strengthened through independent oversight, clear consequences for misconduct, and meaningful public input that includes critics as well as supporters. This balances the need for stable, expert-led governance with legitimate demands for responsiveness, integrity, and respect for diverse communities."
