      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with reliable delivery of core services. People who worry about overreach deserve clear checks, independent oversight, and meaningful avenues for feedback, while those who value effective governance need institutions that are adequately resourced and able to act. A practical middle ground is to set measurable performance goals, publish results openly, enforce consequences for misconduct, and involve communities in decisions that affect them\u2014so trust is earned through both integrity and competence.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger accountability and transparency with reliable delivery of essential services. People who favor reform are right that clear standards, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct are necessary, while those who worry about instability are right that institutions must remain capable and consistent. Building trust means listening to communities, communicating decisions and evidence openly, and showing measurable improvements over time rather than relying on slogans or mere assurances.",
      "Public trust in institutions can grow when they consistently earn it through transparency, accountability, and fair treatment, rather than relying on deference or rhetoric. We can respect the vital role institutions play in delivering public goods while also taking seriously concerns about bias, inefficiency, or past failures by strengthening oversight, auditing, and consequences for misconduct. Building trust should combine measurable performance improvements with open, two-way engagement\u2014clear communication about decisions and tradeoffs, and meaningful opportunities for the public to give input and see results.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair higher transparency and clear accountability with reliable performance on everyday services people depend on. Those who worry about overreach deserve stronger oversight, open data, and protections against conflicts of interest, while those who fear erosion of expertise deserve stable funding and evidence-based decision-making. Building trust requires consistent two-way engagement\u2014listening to communities, explaining choices and tradeoffs plainly, and measuring results publicly\u2014so institutions earn confidence through both integrity and outcomes.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to fairness and effective service delivery. People who worry about abuse of power deserve clear oversight, open data where appropriate, and real consequences for misconduct, while those who value stability and expertise deserve institutions that can act decisively and competently. Building trust means making decisions and results easier to understand, expanding meaningful public input, and measuring performance in ways the public can verify."
