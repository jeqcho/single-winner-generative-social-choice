      "University campuses should be places where robust debate is encouraged, including ideas that some people find uncomfortable, while also maintaining clear standards against harassment, threats, and unlawful discrimination. It\u2019s reasonable to expect consistent, viewpoint-neutral policies that protect speakers\u2019 rights and students\u2019 ability to learn without intimidation. A balanced approach pairs strong free-expression protections with transparent processes, clear time-place-manner rules, and meaningful support for civil dialogue and conflict resolution.",
      "University campuses should protect broad free expression because it is central to learning, while also maintaining clear, content-neutral rules that prevent harassment, threats, and disruption of others\u2019 ability to study and participate. People reasonably disagree about where to draw the line, but most can agree on transparent standards, consistent enforcement, and viewpoint diversity rather than ad hoc decisions. Investing in structured debate, strong due-process protections, and support for those affected by speech can uphold both open inquiry and a safe, inclusive academic environment.",
      "University campuses should be places where a wide range of ideas can be heard and debated, while also ensuring students can learn in an environment free from targeted harassment, threats, or unlawful disruption. People reasonably disagree about where to draw the line between open inquiry and harm prevention, but most can agree that rules should be clear, viewpoint-neutral, and applied consistently. When conflicts arise, campuses should prioritize transparent processes, opportunities for dialogue, and proportionate responses that protect both free expression and community safety.",
      "University campuses should protect broad freedom of expression as a core educational value while also maintaining clear, content-neutral rules that keep events safe and allow learning to continue. It\u2019s reasonable for people to worry both about censorship and about the harm that harassment or disruption can cause, so policies should distinguish protected speech from targeted threats, intimidation, or persistent conduct that denies others equal access. Transparent procedures, consistent enforcement, and more opportunities for dialogue and counter-speech can help campuses uphold open inquiry without sacrificing community safety and inclusion.",

It\u2019s fair to worry both about censorship and about harassment or disruption, so policies should be transparent, consistently enforced, and focused on conduct rather than ideas. Campuses can encourage open debate by providing forums for difficult conversations, supporting peaceful protest, and clearly distinguishing protected expression from threats, targeted harassment, or actions that prevent others from participating."
