They should create structured, well-facilitated spaces for dialogue, where students can learn the historical and human complexities of Israel/Gaza, rather than simply reacting in anger or fear.

They should create structured forums, teach-ins, and moderated debates so students can learn the history and stakes from multiple perspectives, rather than just react to headlines.
