      "University campuses should protect robust free expression as a core academic value while also setting clear, viewpoint-neutral rules that prevent harassment, threats, and disruption of others\u2019 ability to learn. Many people worry either that speech is being chilled or that harm and exclusion are being ignored; both concerns deserve serious attention and transparent processes. A balanced approach promotes open debate, encourages counterspeech and education over punitive responses when possible, and applies consistent standards with due process when conduct crosses the line.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression because open inquiry is central to education, while also setting clear, content-neutral rules that prevent disruption, harassment, or credible threats. It\u2019s reasonable to worry both about chilling speech through overreach and about creating an environment where students can learn without intimidation or exclusion. A practical middle ground is transparent policies, consistent enforcement, and more support for dialogue and debate so controversial ideas can be challenged through reason rather than silencing.",
      "University campuses should protect broad freedom of expression as a core academic value while setting clear, narrowly tailored limits for speech that directly threatens, harasses, or disrupts others\u2019 ability to learn. It\u2019s reasonable to expect schools to allow controversial ideas to be heard and debated, and also to provide strong support and fair processes when members of the community feel targeted or unsafe. A balanced approach emphasizes viewpoint-neutral rules, transparent enforcement, and more dialogue\u2014so students can challenge ideas vigorously without turning disagreement into intimidation or censorship.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression as a core academic value, while also maintaining clear, viewpoint-neutral rules that prevent harassment, true threats, and serious disruption to others\u2019 ability to learn. It\u2019s reasonable to expect administrations to defend unpopular speech and provide support for those affected, rather than trying to police ideas. Transparent policies, consistent enforcement, and more opportunities for structured dialogue can help campuses balance open inquiry with safety and inclusion.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression as a core academic value while also maintaining clear, viewpoint-neutral rules that keep learning and safety intact. It\u2019s reasonable to worry both about censorship that chills debate and about speech or conduct that crosses into targeted harassment or disruption. A workable middle ground is to maximize opportunities for open dialogue and peaceful protest, paired with transparent, consistently applied policies and due process when limits are necessary."
