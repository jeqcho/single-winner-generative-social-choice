      "University campuses should protect robust free expression while recognizing their responsibility to keep learning environments safe and accessible for everyone. That means allowing a wide range of viewpoints\u2014including controversial ones\u2014while enforcing clear, content-neutral rules against harassment, threats, and disruption, and applying them consistently. With transparent policies, fair processes, and a commitment to dialogue, campuses can uphold academic freedom without minimizing legitimate concerns about harm and inclusion.",
      "University campuses should strongly protect free expression as a core academic value, while also setting clear, content-neutral rules that keep teaching and campus life safe and functioning. It\u2019s reasonable to worry both about censorship that chills debate and about harassment or disruption that prevents others from learning and participating. A balanced approach is to allow even unpopular viewpoints to be heard, pair them with opportunities for open dialogue and critique, and intervene only when speech crosses into targeted harassment, credible threats, or persistent disruption.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression as a core part of learning, while also maintaining clear, viewpoint-neutral rules that prevent harassment, true threats, and disruptions that keep others from participating. It\u2019s reasonable to expect administrators to uphold speakers\u2019 rights and students\u2019 safety at the same time by emphasizing open debate, due process, and consistent enforcement regardless of ideology. When conflicts arise, campuses should default to more dialogue and education rather than broad censorship, paired with practical measures that support both access and inclusion.",
      "University campuses should protect broad free expression as a core part of education while also ensuring students can learn in an environment free from targeted harassment and credible threats. A reasonable approach is to use viewpoint-neutral rules\u2014focused on time, place, and manner\u2014paired with transparent, consistent processes that encourage debate rather than cancellation. When conflicts arise, campuses can prioritize dialogue, clear communication, and proportionate responses that address safety and disruption without punishing unpopular ideas.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression as a core academic value while setting clear, viewpoint-neutral rules that prevent harassment, targeted intimidation, and credible threats. People can reasonably disagree about where the line should be drawn, but most share an interest in open inquiry, student safety, and a learning environment where debate is possible. A constructive middle ground is transparent policies applied consistently, plus education and forums that encourage civil disagreement and address harms without defaulting to censorship."
