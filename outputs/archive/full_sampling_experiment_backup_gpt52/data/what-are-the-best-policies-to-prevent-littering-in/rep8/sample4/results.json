      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility and practical support. Communities can pair education and clear expectations with convenient infrastructure\u2014like well-placed bins, recycling options, and regular maintenance\u2014so doing the right thing is easy. Fair, consistent enforcement and targeted fines can address repeat problems without over-penalizing, while incentives and community cleanups build shared ownership and keep public areas welcoming for everyone.",
      "The most effective anti-littering approach balances personal responsibility with practical public support: clear rules and fair, consistent enforcement alongside well-maintained bins, regular collection, and thoughtful street design. Education and community-led campaigns can build shared norms, while targeted penalties and accountability for repeat offenders address those who ignore them. Combining these tools\u2014rather than relying on any single measure\u2014can reduce litter in a way that is both effective and broadly acceptable.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support: clear rules and fair enforcement, alongside enough bins, regular collection, and well-designed public spaces that make proper disposal easy. While some prioritize tougher fines and others emphasize education, a combined approach\u2014targeted enforcement in problem areas, public awareness campaigns, and partnerships with communities and businesses\u2014can reduce litter without being overly punitive. Measuring results and adjusting strategies over time helps ensure the policies stay effective and equitable.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, combining fair enforcement and meaningful fines with convenient, well-maintained disposal options and regular street cleaning. While some prioritize tougher penalties and others prefer education and community-led solutions, most can agree that prevention works best when infrastructure, clear messaging, and accountability reinforce each other. Pairing targeted enforcement in high-litter areas with public campaigns, deposit-return or producer responsibility programs, and local partnerships can reduce litter without being overly punitive.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should combine personal responsibility with practical supports, recognizing that people respond to both incentives and the design of public spaces. A balanced approach pairs consistent, fair enforcement and meaningful penalties with ample, well-placed bins, regular maintenance, and public education that makes proper disposal easy and socially expected. Investing in community cleanups and partnerships with businesses and schools can build shared norms while ensuring the burden doesn\u2019t fall on enforcement alone."
