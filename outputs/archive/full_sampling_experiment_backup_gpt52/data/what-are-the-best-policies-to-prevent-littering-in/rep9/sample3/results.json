      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, combining clear rules and fair enforcement with convenient disposal options like well-placed bins, recycling stations, and regular maintenance. Many people favor education and community norms, while others emphasize deterrence; a reasonable middle ground is to pair public awareness campaigns and youth programs with proportionate fines focused on repeat offenders and problem areas. Working with local residents and businesses to tailor solutions and track results can improve cleanliness without relying solely on punishment or messaging.",
      "The most effective approach to preventing litter in public spaces combines personal responsibility with practical supports: ample, well-maintained bins and recycling options, clear signage, and regular cleanup services. While some favor education and others emphasize penalties, a balanced policy can pair community outreach and incentives with fair, consistently enforced fines for repeated or egregious violations. Investing in convenient disposal infrastructure and shared stewardship helps keep public areas clean without relying solely on punishment or voluntary compliance.",

For those who favor stronger accountability, fair and consistent enforcement\u2014paired with warnings or community service options\u2014can deter repeat offenders without over-penalizing minor mistakes. At the same time, partnerships with businesses and community groups, along with incentives like deposit-return or cleanup rewards, can reduce waste at the source and build shared pride in keeping public areas clean.",
