      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, recognizing that enforcement alone can feel punitive while education alone may be too slow to change behavior. A middle-ground approach combines well-maintained bins and recycling options, clear signage and public campaigns, and fair, consistent penalties focused on repeated or egregious violations. Pairing these measures with community cleanups and partnerships with businesses helps keep public spaces clean without overburdening any one group.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support from public agencies and businesses. A reasonable middle ground combines clear rules and fair, consistent enforcement with convenient infrastructure\u2014like well-placed bins, regular collection, and well-designed public spaces\u2014so proper disposal is easy. It also pairs targeted education and community cleanup partnerships with proportionate penalties, prioritizing prevention and behavior change while holding repeat or egregious offenders accountable.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing litter in public spaces should combine education and shared responsibility with practical infrastructure, like well-placed bins and regular maintenance, so doing the right thing is easy. It can pair proportionate, consistently enforced penalties for chronic offenders with positive incentives and community-led cleanups, reflecting both accountability and engagement. By involving residents, businesses, and local government in clear standards and transparent reporting, policies can protect public health and neighborhood pride without relying solely on punishment or voluntary action.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, combining clear rules and fair enforcement with convenient, well-maintained disposal and recycling options. Many people favor education and community pride efforts, while others prioritize deterrence; a workable middle ground is to pair targeted fines for repeat offenders with public awareness campaigns and periodic cleanups. Regularly measuring litter hotspots and adjusting resources\u2014like bins, signage, and street cleaning\u2014can reduce mess without relying solely on punishment.",
      "The most effective anti-littering policies balance shared responsibility with practical support: clear rules and fair enforcement, paired with convenient disposal options and public education. People who favor personal accountability can support consistent fines and community standards, while those emphasizing system design can back investments in well-placed bins, recycling infrastructure, and regular maintenance. Combining targeted enforcement in problem areas with incentives and outreach can reduce litter without over-policing or relying solely on voluntary behavior."
