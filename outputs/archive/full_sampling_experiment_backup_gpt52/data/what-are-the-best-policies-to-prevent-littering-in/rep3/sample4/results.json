      "The most effective approach to reducing litter in public spaces combines personal responsibility with practical public support: accessible bins and recycling options, clear signage, and consistent maintenance. At the same time, fair enforcement and targeted fines can deter repeat offenders, while education and community cleanups help build shared norms without relying solely on punishment. By pairing infrastructure, incentives, and proportionate enforcement, communities can keep spaces clean while respecting different views on cost, individual freedom, and accountability.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that pairs shared responsibility with practical support. Stronger enforcement and meaningful fines can deter chronic offenders, while convenient bins, regular collection, and clear signage make it easy for most people to do the right thing. Education and community cleanups can build long-term norms without over-policing, and targeted measures can be focused on high-litter areas so costs and penalties stay proportionate.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best when communities combine personal responsibility with practical, fair support from local government and businesses. A balanced approach pairs convenient infrastructure (more bins, recycling, and regular cleanup) and ongoing education with proportionate, consistently enforced penalties for repeated violations. It can also include positive incentives and community partnerships\u2014like deposit-return programs and volunteer cleanups\u2014so the burden doesn\u2019t fall on any one group while public spaces stay clean for everyone.",
      "The most effective way to prevent littering in public spaces is a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical public support. Communities can pair consistent, fair enforcement and anti-dumping penalties with easy access to well-placed bins, regular maintenance, and clear signage, so doing the right thing is simple. At the same time, education campaigns and community cleanups can build shared norms without relying solely on punishment, while businesses and event organizers contribute through stewardship requirements and waste-reduction measures.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support from public agencies and businesses. A consensus approach combines clear rules and fair, consistent enforcement with convenient disposal and recycling options, regular maintenance, and targeted education so compliance is easy and widely understood. Where appropriate, modest incentives or deposit-return programs can complement penalties, focusing on measurable reductions in litter while keeping costs and burdens reasonable."
