      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical support. Communities can pair clear rules and fair, consistent enforcement with convenient infrastructure like well-placed bins, regular cleanup, and education that encourages pride in shared spaces. Targeted measures\u2014such as deposit-return programs for common litter items and partnerships with local businesses and civic groups\u2014can reduce waste while keeping costs and penalties proportionate.",
      "The most effective approach to preventing littering in public spaces combines shared responsibility with practical supports: make proper disposal easy through well-placed bins, consistent collection, and clear signage, while also investing in education and community-led cleanups to build lasting norms. At the same time, fair and predictable enforcement\u2014such as warnings for first offenses and targeted fines for repeat or high-impact violations\u2014can deter problem behavior without over-penalizing minor mistakes. By pairing convenient infrastructure, positive engagement, and proportionate accountability, communities can reduce litter in a way that is both effective and broadly acceptable.",
      "The most effective anti-littering approach combines personal responsibility with practical public support: clear expectations and fair enforcement, alongside convenient, well-maintained disposal and recycling options. People who prioritize education and those who favor deterrence can agree on focusing resources where litter is most common, using visible signage, community outreach, and proportionate fines for repeat offenses. Regular cleanups and transparent reporting can reinforce shared civic pride while ensuring policies are evaluated and adjusted based on what measurably reduces litter.",
      "The most effective anti-littering approach combines shared personal responsibility with practical public support: make proper disposal easy through well-placed bins and regular maintenance, while pairing clear rules with fair, consistent enforcement. At the same time, education and community-led cleanups can build long-term norms without relying solely on punishment, and targeted incentives can help where they\u2019re cost-effective. By blending infrastructure, outreach, and proportionate penalties, communities can reduce litter while respecting both public budgets and individual freedoms.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility and practical support. Communities can pair fair, consistently enforced penalties with convenient disposal options (more bins, recycling, and regular pickup) and targeted education so people know what\u2019s expected and why it matters. This middle-ground strategy respects concerns about over-policing and costs while still prioritizing clean, safe public areas through shared accountability."
