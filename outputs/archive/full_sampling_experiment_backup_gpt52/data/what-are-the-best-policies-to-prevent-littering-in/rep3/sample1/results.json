      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, pairing fair enforcement with convenient disposal options and public education. Those who favor stricter penalties and those who prefer voluntary compliance can agree on targeted fines for repeated or egregious littering, alongside well-maintained bins, clear signage, and community cleanup programs. Regular measurement of litter hotspots and transparent reporting can help adjust strategies so they stay effective without becoming overly punitive.",
      "The most effective anti-littering approach balances personal responsibility with practical support from public services: clear rules and fair enforcement alongside convenient, well-maintained bins, regular cleanup, and public education. People who favor tougher penalties and those who prioritize community-based solutions can agree that preventing litter is cheaper and cleaner than constant remediation, and that policies should be judged by measurable reductions in waste. A combined strategy\u2014targeted enforcement in hotspots, incentives and infrastructure that make proper disposal easy, and partnerships with schools and local groups\u2014can reduce litter without overburdening residents or businesses.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, combining fair enforcement and meaningful penalties with convenient, well-maintained disposal and recycling options. While some prioritize education and community norms and others emphasize deterrence, most can agree on a mix of public awareness campaigns, targeted enforcement in problem areas, and partnerships with local groups and businesses to keep spaces clean. Regular measurement and public reporting can help ensure these measures stay cost-effective, equitable, and focused on prevention rather than punishment alone.",
      "The most effective anti-littering approach balances personal responsibility with practical public support: clear rules and fair enforcement paired with convenient disposal options and education. People who prioritize accountability can back targeted fines for repeat or egregious violations, while those focused on systemic solutions can support more bins, frequent collection, and better signage in high-traffic areas. A consensus policy combines these tools and regularly measures outcomes so resources go to interventions that measurably reduce litter without overburdening communities.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support: clear rules and fair, consistently enforced penalties alongside convenient disposal options like well-placed bins, recycling, and regular maintenance. Supporters of stronger enforcement can agree it works best when paired with public education and community-led cleanups that make norms visible and shared. At the same time, those wary of punitive approaches can support targeted enforcement focused on chronic hotspots and repeat offenders, with fines reinvested into local sanitation and prevention."
