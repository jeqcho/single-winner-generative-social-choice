Cities should place and maintain well-marked trash and recycling bins in high-traffic areas, keep them regularly serviced, and use clear signage so proper disposal is the easy default.

      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine personal responsibility with practical public support: clear rules and fair enforcement alongside convenient, well-maintained disposal and recycling options. Those who emphasize education can be met with sustained public campaigns and school programs, while those who prioritize accountability can be met with targeted fines and cleanup requirements in chronic problem areas. Investing in bin placement, street cleaning, and partnerships with businesses and community groups can reduce litter without over-policing, and using data to evaluate results keeps the policy both effective and proportionate.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine convenient infrastructure (more bins, regular collection, and clear signage) with education and community norms that encourage people to take responsibility for shared spaces. At the same time, fair and consistently applied enforcement\u2014such as warnings and modest fines\u2014can deter repeat offenders without over-policing. Pairing these measures with incentives like deposit-return programs and support for local cleanups can align public, business, and environmental interests around cleaner public spaces.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing litter in public spaces should pair personal responsibility with practical public support: make proper disposal easy through well-placed, well-maintained bins and regular cleaning, while running ongoing education and community engagement to build shared norms. For those who prioritize accountability, fair and consistent enforcement\u2014focused on repeat or high-impact offenders\u2014can deter littering without becoming punitive. Together, these measures protect public health and neighborhood pride while keeping costs reasonable and respecting different views on government\u2019s role.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine personal responsibility with practical support: convenient bins and regular maintenance, clear expectations through signage and education, and fair, consistent enforcement for repeat or egregious violations. Those who emphasize community norms can back campaigns and school programs, while those focused on accountability can support targeted fines that fund cleanup and waste infrastructure. By pairing prevention, access, and proportionate consequences, communities can reduce litter without relying solely on punishment or solely on voluntary behavior.",
      "The best approach to preventing littering in public spaces combines shared responsibility with practical enforcement: making proper disposal easy through well-placed bins and regular maintenance, while also applying fair, consistent penalties for repeated violations. Many people prefer education and community pride campaigns, while others emphasize deterrence\u2014both can work together when paired with clear rules and visible outcomes. By investing in infrastructure, targeted outreach, and proportionate enforcement, communities can reduce litter without placing the burden on any single group."
