      "The most effective policies to prevent littering combine fair enforcement with practical support, recognizing that some people prioritize personal responsibility while others emphasize better infrastructure and public services. A balanced approach pairs visible bins, regular maintenance, and convenient recycling/compost options with clear, proportionate fines and consistent enforcement in high-problem areas. It also invests in education and community partnerships so expectations are understood and people have real opportunities to comply, reducing litter without relying solely on punishment or solely on messaging.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine personal responsibility with practical support: make disposal easy through well-placed bins, regular maintenance, and clear signage, while reinforcing norms through education and community-led initiatives. For those who favor enforcement, fair and consistent fines can deter repeat offenders, but they should be paired with accessible alternatives and options like community service to avoid disproportionately burdening low-income residents. By using data to target hotspots and measuring results, cities can prioritize cost-effective measures while keeping public spaces clean and welcoming for everyone.",
      "The most effective anti-littering policies combine practical infrastructure\u2014more bins, recycling options, and regular maintenance\u2014with fair, consistent enforcement for repeated violations. At the same time, public education and community-led cleanups can build shared norms without relying solely on punishment. A balanced approach that pairs incentives and outreach with targeted fines, funded transparently and reinvested into cleaner public spaces, can respect personal responsibility while addressing the real-world conditions that drive littering.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should combine fair enforcement with practical support, recognizing that some prioritize personal responsibility while others emphasize better public services. A balanced approach includes clearly marked, conveniently placed bins and regular collection, paired with modest, consistently applied fines and community service options for repeat offenders. Public education and partnerships with businesses and local groups can reinforce norms without over-policing, and results should be monitored so measures can be adjusted based on what actually reduces litter.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine fair enforcement with practical supports that make responsible disposal easy and expected. This means providing plentiful, well-maintained bins and recycling options, improving street cleaning and signage, and running education campaigns, while also using proportionate fines or community service for repeat or egregious offenders. By pairing shared responsibility with convenient infrastructure and consistent accountability, communities can reduce litter without relying solely on punishment or solely on voluntary behavior."
