      "The most effective approach to preventing litter in public spaces balances personal responsibility with practical support and fair enforcement. Communities can agree on investing in convenient, well-maintained bins and regular cleaning, paired with clear education and signage that encourages shared stewardship. Where littering persists, proportionate fines and community service can be used consistently, while also considering incentives and partnerships with businesses and event organizers to reduce waste at the source.",
      "The most effective anti-littering policies pair shared responsibility with practical support: communities can strengthen enforcement for habitual offenders while also making it easier to do the right thing through well-placed bins, recycling options, and regular maintenance. To respect concerns about fairness and cost, penalties can be proportional and focused on repeat violations, with alternatives like community service and education for first-time offenses. By combining smart infrastructure, public awareness campaigns, and targeted enforcement, public spaces can stay cleaner without relying solely on punishment or solely on voluntary compliance.",
      "The most effective anti-littering policies combine shared responsibility with practical support: clear rules and fair, consistent enforcement paired with convenient disposal options like well-placed bins, recycling, and regular maintenance. People who prioritize personal accountability can support targeted fines and community standards, while those focused on systemic solutions can back investments in infrastructure, education, and producer responsibility to reduce waste at the source. Together, these measures can cut litter without being overly punitive, while keeping public spaces clean and welcoming for everyone.",
      "Effective anti-litter policies should balance personal responsibility with practical support, combining clear enforcement for repeat or deliberate offenders with convenient disposal options like well-placed bins, recycling, and regular maintenance. Many people favor education and community pride campaigns, while others emphasize penalties; a consensus approach pairs visible messaging and school/community programs with fair, proportional fines and consistent enforcement in high-impact areas. Using data to target hotspots and reinvesting fine revenue into cleanup and infrastructure can build trust and show tangible results without overburdening residents.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine practical infrastructure\u2014like plentiful, well-maintained bins and regular cleaning\u2014with fair, consistently enforced penalties for repeat or egregious violations. At the same time, public education and community partnerships can build shared norms and reduce reliance on punitive measures alone. By pairing accountability with convenience and civic engagement, communities can protect public spaces while respecting differing views on enforcement and personal responsibility."
