      "Effective anti-littering policy should combine fair enforcement with practical supports, recognizing that some people respond best to penalties while others need convenient ways to dispose of waste. A balanced approach pairs clear fines for repeat or deliberate littering with ample, well-maintained bins, frequent collection, and public education campaigns that build shared norms. Investing in proven tools like deposit-return programs and targeted cleanup funding can reduce waste without placing disproportionate burdens on any one group.",
      "The most effective approach to reducing litter balances personal responsibility with practical support from local government and businesses. Communities can pair fair, consistently enforced penalties with convenient infrastructure\u2014more bins, recycling options, and regular cleaning\u2014so proper disposal is easy. At the same time, education and community-led campaigns can build shared norms, while targeted measures (like deposit-return systems or requirements on high-waste vendors) focus on the biggest sources of litter without overburdening everyone.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should pair consistent, fair enforcement with practical supports that make proper disposal easy, such as plentiful bins, regular collection, and well-designed public spaces. Many people prefer education and community pride campaigns, while others emphasize penalties and accountability; combining both can reinforce shared norms without overreliance on punishment. Targeted measures like deposit-return systems for common litter items and partnerships with businesses and local groups can reduce waste at the source while keeping costs and burdens reasonable.",
      "The best way to prevent littering in public spaces is a balanced approach that pairs shared personal responsibility with practical public support. Communities can agree on providing ample, well-maintained bins, clear signage, and convenient recycling options while also using fair, consistently enforced penalties for repeat violations. Education campaigns and community cleanups can build pride and norms against littering, with targeted efforts in high-traffic areas to ensure resources and enforcement are used efficiently.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best through a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with supportive public systems. Many people favor education and community norms, while others emphasize enforcement; a consensus path pairs clear rules and fair, targeted penalties with convenient disposal options (well-placed bins, regular collection) and ongoing public outreach. Measuring results and adjusting\u2014especially in high-traffic areas\u2014can keep policies effective without being overly punitive."
