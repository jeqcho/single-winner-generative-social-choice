      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine personal responsibility with practical support: make proper disposal easy through well-placed, well-maintained bins and regular collection, while also using fair, consistently enforced penalties for repeated or egregious violations. At the same time, public education and community-led cleanups can build shared norms without over-policing, and targeted measures like deposit-return programs or requirements for event organizers can reduce litter at the source. By pairing infrastructure, incentives, and proportionate enforcement, communities can keep public spaces clean while respecting budgets and differing views on regulation.",
      "The most effective approach to preventing littering combines practical infrastructure with fair enforcement and community engagement. Many people prioritize personal responsibility and deterrence, while others emphasize making it easy to dispose of waste through well-placed bins, regular collection, and cleaner public facilities; a balanced policy can do both. Investing in convenient disposal options and education, paired with proportionate fines and targeted enforcement in high-litter areas, can reduce litter without being overly punitive.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine shared responsibility with practical support: make proper disposal easy through well-placed bins, regular maintenance, and clear signage, while also running public education and community cleanup efforts. For those who emphasize accountability, proportionate and consistently enforced fines can deter repeat offenders, but they should be paired with options like warnings or community service to keep enforcement fair. Overall, investing in convenient infrastructure, civic norms, and targeted enforcement offers the best chance to reduce litter without overburdening the public or local budgets.",
      "Effective anti-litter policies should balance personal responsibility with practical infrastructure, recognizing that education and enforcement each play a role. A middle-ground approach combines well-maintained bins and recycling options, clear signage and community education, and targeted, proportionate penalties focused on repeat or high-impact offenders. Supporting regular cleanups and partnering with local businesses and residents can build shared ownership while keeping public spaces welcoming and safe.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, combining clear rules and fair enforcement with convenient, well-maintained waste and recycling options. Those who favor tougher penalties and those who prioritize education can agree on data-driven measures: targeted fines in chronic hotspots alongside sustained public-awareness campaigns and community cleanups. Investing in bin access, signage, and routine maintenance\u2014paired with transparent evaluation\u2014can reduce litter without overburdening residents or businesses."
