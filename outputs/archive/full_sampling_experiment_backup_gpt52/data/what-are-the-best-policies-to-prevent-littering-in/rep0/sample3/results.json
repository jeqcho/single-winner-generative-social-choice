      "Preventing littering in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical support from local government and businesses. Clear, consistently enforced penalties can deter repeat offenders, while convenient, well-maintained bins, regular collection, and targeted education make it easier for most people to do the right thing. Pairing these measures with community cleanups and incentives for waste reduction can build shared ownership without relying solely on punishment or public spending.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support from public services, recognizing that enforcement alone can feel punitive while education alone may be too slow to change behavior. A middle-ground approach combines clear fines for repeat or egregious violations with well-funded trash and recycling infrastructure, frequent maintenance, and targeted public campaigns that make proper disposal easy and socially expected. Pairing data-driven enforcement with community partnerships and incentives (like deposit-return programs) can reduce litter while maintaining fairness and public trust.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine education and accessible infrastructure with fair, consistently enforced accountability. Most people agree that clear signage, convenient trash and recycling bins, and regular maintenance make it easier to do the right thing, while targeted fines and community service penalties can deter repeat or deliberate offenders. Pairing these measures with community cleanups and partnerships with local businesses can build shared ownership of public spaces without relying solely on punishment.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical support and fair enforcement. Communities can agree to invest in well-placed bins, regular cleaning, and clear signage while also using education and incentives to build long-term norms against littering. At the same time, proportionate fines or community-service alternatives can deter repeat offenses, especially when paired with consistent enforcement and opportunities for local businesses and residents to share in solutions.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine fair enforcement with practical support, recognizing that both personal responsibility and well-designed public services matter. Communities can pair clear fines and consistent education with more and better-placed bins, regular collection, and incentives for businesses and residents to keep areas clean. By focusing on clean, convenient infrastructure and predictable accountability\u2014while avoiding overly punitive measures\u2014cities can reduce litter in ways that are effective, equitable, and widely acceptable."
