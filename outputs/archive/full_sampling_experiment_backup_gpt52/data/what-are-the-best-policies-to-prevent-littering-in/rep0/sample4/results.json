      "The most effective way to reduce littering is a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical support from public institutions. This can include adequate bins and regular maintenance, clear and consistently enforced penalties for repeat offenders, and education or community-led initiatives that make proper disposal the easy, socially expected choice. By pairing fair enforcement with accessible infrastructure and public engagement, communities can cut litter without relying solely on punishment or solely on voluntary behavior.",
      "The most effective approach to preventing littering combines personal responsibility with practical public support, rather than relying solely on punishment or awareness campaigns. Communities can agree on keeping public spaces clean by pairing convenient disposal options (well-placed bins, regular maintenance) and education with fair, consistently enforced penalties for repeat or intentional offenders. This balances concerns about over-policing and costs while recognizing that clean streets benefit everyone and require both good infrastructure and shared norms.",
      "The most effective policies to prevent littering in public spaces combine shared responsibility with practical supports: clear rules and consistent, proportional enforcement alongside convenient disposal options and education. Those who favor stronger penalties can agree that consequences matter, while those focused on community solutions can emphasize making the right choice easy through more bins, regular maintenance, and public campaigns. A balanced approach also includes targeted interventions in high-litter areas and partnerships with local businesses and community groups to sustain long-term behavior change.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, combining fair enforcement with convenient disposal options and public education. People who prioritize accountability can support targeted fines for repeat offenders, while those focused on prevention can back better bin placement, regular maintenance, and community-led cleanups. A consensus approach sets clear rules, funds infrastructure, and uses data to adapt strategies so public spaces stay clean without relying on punishment alone.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine better infrastructure and education with fair, consistent enforcement. Most people can agree that providing enough bins, clear signage, and convenient recycling options\u2014alongside public campaigns\u2014makes it easier to do the right thing, while targeted fines or community service for repeat offenders helps deter bad behavior. Pairing these measures with community cleanups and partnerships with businesses can build shared ownership without placing the burden on any single group."
