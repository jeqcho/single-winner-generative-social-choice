      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical support and fair enforcement. Investing in convenient bins, regular collection, and clear signage\u2014paired with education and community-led cleanups\u2014addresses concerns about accessibility and civic pride without relying solely on punishment. At the same time, consistent, proportionate penalties for repeat offenders and stronger accountability for businesses or events that generate waste can protect public spaces while respecting different views on the role of government.",
      "The most effective anti-littering policies balance personal responsibility with practical support: clear rules and fair, consistently enforced penalties paired with convenient infrastructure like well-placed bins, recycling options, and regular maintenance. While some emphasize education and community pride and others prioritize deterrence, both approaches can work together through targeted outreach, visible signage, and occasional high-visibility enforcement in problem areas. Combining these measures with data-driven evaluation helps ensure resources are focused where they reduce litter most and improve public spaces for everyone.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical infrastructure: clear rules and fair enforcement alongside ample bins, regular collection, and well-designed public spaces. Those who prioritize deterrence can support proportionate fines and targeted enforcement in problem areas, while those who favor education can back ongoing school and community campaigns and easy reporting tools. A consensus approach combines prevention (convenient disposal and product stewardship), accountability (consistent enforcement), and partnership (local government, businesses, and residents) to reduce litter without overburdening any one group.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, combining clear rules and fair enforcement with convenient disposal options like well-placed bins and regular maintenance. Some prioritize stricter penalties to deter bad behavior, while others emphasize education and community norms; a middle-ground approach can fund targeted enforcement in hotspots alongside public campaigns and school programs. Pairing these with incentives for local cleanups and business participation can reduce litter without relying solely on punishment or solely on outreach.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine practical infrastructure\u2014like plentiful, well-placed bins and regular maintenance\u2014with clear expectations for public behavior through education and visible signage. While some favor stricter enforcement and fines and others emphasize personal responsibility and community pride, both can work together by focusing penalties on repeat or egregious offenses while making it easy for everyone to dispose of waste properly. Partnering with local businesses, schools, and community groups to support clean-up efforts and reduce waste at the source can improve public spaces without placing the burden on any single group."
