      "The most effective anti-littering approach balances personal responsibility with practical support: make proper disposal easy and expected through plentiful, well-maintained bins and clear signage, while pairing education and community cleanups with targeted enforcement for repeat or high-impact violations. This respects concerns about over-policing and public costs by prioritizing prevention and data-driven placement of resources, using fines sparingly and fairly. By combining convenient infrastructure, social norms, and proportionate accountability, communities can reduce litter without placing the burden entirely on either individuals or government.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, combining fair enforcement with accessible disposal options. Clear signage, well-maintained bins, and consistent fines for repeat offenders can deter littering, while education campaigns and community cleanups build long-term norms without over-policing. Investing in producer responsibility measures (like deposit-return or packaging reductions) can further reduce waste at the source in a way that aligns environmental goals with public convenience.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical public support. Communities can pair consistent, fair enforcement and targeted penalties with ample trash and recycling bins, regular maintenance, and education campaigns that make proper disposal easy and socially expected. Investing in partnerships with local businesses and community groups\u2014and using data to focus efforts on litter hotspots\u2014can reduce waste without relying solely on punishment or solely on voluntary behavior.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical support and fair enforcement. Communities can invest in well-placed bins, regular maintenance, and clear signage alongside education campaigns, while using proportionate fines and targeted enforcement in litter hotspots. Pairing these measures with incentives and community cleanup partnerships helps keep public areas clean without relying solely on punishment or solely on voluntary action.",
      "The best anti-littering policies balance shared responsibility with practical support: clear rules and fair enforcement paired with easy access to bins, regular collection, and well-designed public spaces. Those who prioritize personal accountability can support targeted fines for repeat or egregious offenders, while those emphasizing systemic solutions can back education, community cleanups, and producer responsibility for high-waste products. A combined approach\u2014making proper disposal the simplest choice and holding people and businesses accountable when they don\u2019t\u2014can reduce litter without over-policing or shifting costs unfairly."
