      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine fair enforcement with practical support for people to dispose of waste responsibly. This means investing in well-placed bins, regular collection, and clear signage alongside proportionate fines and targeted enforcement in high-problem areas. At the same time, public education and community partnerships can reinforce shared norms without relying solely on punishment, while transparent reporting helps ensure the costs and benefits are distributed fairly.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should combine shared responsibility with practical support: clear rules and fair, consistent enforcement alongside convenient trash and recycling bins, regular collection, and well-designed public spaces. Those who prioritize personal accountability can support meaningful penalties for repeat offenders, while those focused on systemic solutions can back investments in infrastructure, education, and community cleanups. A balanced approach also uses targeted incentives and partnerships with businesses and event organizers to reduce waste at the source, making it easier for people to do the right thing.",
      "Effective anti-litter policies can balance personal responsibility with practical support by combining clear rules and fair enforcement with convenient disposal options and regular maintenance. While some emphasize education and community norms and others prioritize penalties, a middle-ground approach pairs targeted fines for repeat or high-impact littering with well-funded bins, recycling access, and cleanup programs. Built-in transparency\u2014such as reporting on litter hot spots and how fine revenue funds improvements\u2014can build trust and encourage broad participation.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine personal responsibility with practical public support: clear rules and fair, consistently enforced penalties alongside convenient, well-maintained disposal and recycling options. While some prioritize education and community pride and others emphasize enforcement, both can work together through targeted outreach, visible signage, and regular cleaning in high-traffic areas. Pairing incentives and partnerships with businesses and local groups with data-driven enforcement can reduce litter without overburdening residents or budgets.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical support from local governments and businesses. That means making proper disposal easy and affordable\u2014more bins, regular collection, clear signage\u2014while using fair, consistent enforcement for chronic problem areas. Pairing these measures with education and community-led cleanups can build a shared norm of care without relying solely on punishment or solely on voluntary behavior."
