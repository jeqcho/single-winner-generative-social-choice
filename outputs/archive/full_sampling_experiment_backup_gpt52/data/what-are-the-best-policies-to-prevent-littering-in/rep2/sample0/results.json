      "The most effective anti-littering policies combine fair enforcement with convenient disposal options and sustained public education, recognizing that both personal responsibility and well-designed public spaces matter. Reasonable fines and targeted enforcement can deter repeat offenders, while plentiful bins, regular maintenance, and clear signage make the right choice easy for everyone. Pairing these measures with community engagement\u2014such as school programs and local cleanups\u2014can build shared norms without relying solely on punishment or voluntary behavior.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine education and convenient infrastructure with fair, consistent enforcement. Most people agree that clearer signage, more bins (including recycling), and well-maintained public spaces make it easier to do the right thing, while targeted fines for repeat or high-impact offenses help deter problem behavior. Pairing these steps with community cleanups and partnerships with local businesses can build shared ownership without relying solely on punishment or voluntary efforts.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical public support: clear rules and fair, consistent enforcement paired with convenient disposal options and regular maintenance. Those who prioritize accountability can support targeted fines for repeat or egregious offenders, while those focused on prevention can back education, community cleanups, and better bin placement and signage. A combined approach\u2014data-driven, equitable, and focused on making the right choice easy\u2014can reduce litter without overburdening communities or taxpayers.",
      "The most effective approach to preventing littering in public spaces blends shared responsibility with practical support: make proper disposal easy through well-placed bins, regular collection, and clear signage, while also maintaining fair enforcement for repeated or deliberate offenders. Many people prefer education and community pride campaigns, while others emphasize deterrence; a balanced policy can prioritize awareness and incentives first, backed by proportionate fines when needed. Pairing these measures with partnerships among local government, businesses, and residents can keep spaces clean without relying solely on punishment or on voluntary compliance.",
      "The most effective anti-littering policies combine shared responsibility with practical support: make proper disposal easy through more bins, clear signage, and regular maintenance, while also using fair, consistent enforcement for repeat or egregious offenses. This approach respects concerns about over-policing by prioritizing education, community cleanups, and targeted interventions, yet recognizes that rules and penalties still matter to protect public spaces. Pairing enforcement with incentives and partnerships with local businesses and schools can reduce litter sustainably without placing the burden on any single group."
