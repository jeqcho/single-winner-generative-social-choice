      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility and practical support from public agencies. Many people prefer education and community pride campaigns, while others emphasize consistent enforcement; a consensus can pair clear rules and fair, targeted fines with convenient infrastructure like well-placed bins, regular pickup, and modern recycling options. By tracking results and focusing enforcement on chronic problem areas while investing in public outreach, communities can reduce litter without over-policing or shifting all costs onto taxpayers.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine personal responsibility with practical support, recognizing that education and convenience can reduce waste while fair enforcement deters repeat offenders. Communities can agree on keeping public spaces clean by pairing clear rules and consistent, proportional fines with well-placed bins, regular collection, and public awareness campaigns. Investing in partnerships with local businesses and community groups for cleanup efforts and incentives can further strengthen shared ownership without relying solely on punishment.",
      "The most effective anti-littering policies combine shared responsibility with practical support: clear rules and fair, consistent enforcement alongside convenient disposal options like well-placed bins and regular maintenance. To address concerns about over-policing and cost, cities can prioritize education, community cleanups, and targeted enforcement in high-litter areas, funded in part through producer responsibility or modest fines. This balanced approach protects public spaces while emphasizing prevention, accessibility, and accountability from individuals, businesses, and government alike.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical support and fair enforcement. Communities can agree on investing in well-placed bins, regular cleaning, and clear signage, while also using education and incentives to build lasting habits. For those who favor stricter measures, targeted fines and enforcement can focus on chronic problem areas, alongside partnerships with local groups and businesses to keep spaces clean without over-policing.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should combine personal responsibility with practical support, recognizing that enforcement alone can feel punitive while education alone may not change behavior quickly. A balanced approach pairs clear rules and fair, consistent penalties with convenient disposal options (more bins, recycling, and frequent collection) and targeted public campaigns. This protects shared public spaces while keeping the focus on making it easy to do the right thing and holding repeat or egregious offenders accountable."
