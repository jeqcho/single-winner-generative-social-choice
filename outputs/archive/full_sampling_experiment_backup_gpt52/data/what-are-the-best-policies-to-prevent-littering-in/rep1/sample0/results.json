      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, recognizing that people respond to both incentives and convenient infrastructure. A middle-ground approach combines consistent enforcement of reasonable penalties with investments in well-placed bins, regular cleaning, and public education so compliance is easy and expectations are clear. Pairing these measures with community partnerships and periodic evaluation can reduce litter without over-policing or relying solely on voluntary behavior.",
      "The most effective anti-littering approach balances personal responsibility with practical support: clear rules and fair, consistent enforcement alongside ample, well-placed bins, regular collection, and public education. People who prioritize individual accountability can support meaningful penalties for repeated violations, while those focused on equity and prevention can back infrastructure upgrades and community-led cleanup programs that make proper disposal easy. Combining these tools\u2014targeted enforcement, smart design, and sustained outreach\u2014reduces litter without relying on any single strategy.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical support from local government and businesses. Communities can pair education and social norms with well-placed bins, reliable collection, and clear signage, while using fair, consistently enforced penalties for chronic or deliberate offenders. This middle ground respects concerns about over-policing and costs by prioritizing convenient infrastructure and positive incentives first, and reserving stronger enforcement for repeat problems.",
      "The most effective anti-littering policies combine personal responsibility with practical support, pairing clear rules and fair, consistent penalties with enough bins, convenient recycling options, and regular collection. At the same time, education and community-led cleanups can build shared norms without relying solely on punishment. A balanced approach targets persistent problem areas with data-driven enforcement while also making it easy\u2014and socially expected\u2014for everyone to dispose of waste properly.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, combining fair enforcement with accessible disposal options. Many people favor education and community pride campaigns, while others emphasize fines and accountability; a workable approach pairs both, with escalating penalties for repeat offenders and consistent messaging about shared public benefits. Investing in enough bins, regular collection, and targeted design changes in high-traffic areas makes compliance easy, while community cleanups and school programs build long-term norms without over-policing."
