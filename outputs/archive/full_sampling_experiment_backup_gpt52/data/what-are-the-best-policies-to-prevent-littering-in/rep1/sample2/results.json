      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support from public services. A reasonable middle ground combines clear rules and fair, consistent enforcement with convenient disposal options (well-placed bins, recycling, and regular cleanup) and public education that builds community pride. Pairing targeted penalties for repeat or high-impact offenses with positive incentives\u2014like deposit-return programs and neighborhood cleanup partnerships\u2014can reduce litter without relying solely on punishment or solely on messaging.",
      "Effective anti-litter policies should balance personal responsibility with practical support, recognizing that education alone may not work without convenient disposal options and fair, consistent enforcement. A middle-ground approach combines more and better-placed bins, clear signage and public campaigns, and proportionate penalties paired with community service or cleanup programs for repeat offenders. This respects concerns about public costs and over-policing while still protecting shared spaces through prevention, accountability, and community partnership.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine fair enforcement with practical supports that make responsible disposal easy. This means maintaining adequate bins and regular collection, running education and community cleanup programs, and applying targeted fines for repeated or high-impact violations rather than relying solely on punishment. By pairing shared civic expectations with well-funded infrastructure and outreach, communities can reduce litter while respecting concerns about cost, equity, and personal responsibility.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, combining fair enforcement with convenient ways to dispose of waste. Many people favor tougher fines to deter bad behavior, while others prioritize education and better infrastructure; a middle ground is to invest in well-placed bins, regular cleanup, and public messaging alongside proportionate penalties that escalate for repeat offenders. Partnering with local businesses and community groups can reinforce shared norms and keep public spaces clean without relying solely on punishment.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical public support. Communities can pair fair enforcement for repeat or intentional offenses with positive incentives and education, while also making proper disposal easy through well-placed bins, regular collection, and clear signage. By investing in infrastructure and community partnerships without relying solely on punishment, policies can reduce litter in a way that is both effective and broadly acceptable."
