    "statement": "I\u2019d keep the Electoral College\u2019s state-by-state balance, but reform it so the outcome tracks voters more closely and people in \u201csafe\u201d states don\u2019t feel written off. A practical compromise is requiring electors to be bound to the state vote, moving away from winner-take-all toward a Maine/Nebraska-style or proportional allocation, and pairing that with clear, uniform rules for recounts, certification, and election integrity. That respects federalism and rural voices while making every vote matter more and improving trust in the result."

A practical compromise is to require states to bind electors to the certified vote and move away from winner-take-all by adopting a Maine/Nebraska-style district method or proportional allocation, paired with clear, uniform standards for recounts, certification, and election integrity.

    "statement": "I\u2019d support a phased path toward a true national popular vote that keeps the system stable: start by ending winner-take-all through proportional allocation of electors in every state, and adopt the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact once it reaches the threshold to guarantee the popular vote winner takes office. Pair that with uniform national standards for ballot access, recounts, and election security so every vote is protected and counted the same everywhere. This would make campaigns compete for voters in every community\u2014not just swing states\u2014while respecting federalism and building broad trust in the outcome."
