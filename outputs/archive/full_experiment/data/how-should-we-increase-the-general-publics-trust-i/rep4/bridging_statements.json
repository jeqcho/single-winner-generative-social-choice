    "statement": "We can rebuild trust in our institutions by insisting on simple, visible accountability: secure paper ballots with strict chain-of-custody, routinely audited by independent, bipartisan teams, with results and fixes published in plain English for the public to review. Pair that with clean, accurate voter rolls and straightforward eligibility checks, while keeping voting accessible for seniors and people with disabilities. If officials communicate calmly, promptly, and without partisan spin\u2014and invest in basic civics education\u2014people will trust what they can see verified, even when they don\u2019t like the outcome."

    "statement": "Public trust in elections and other institutions grows when the rules are clear, applied the same way everywhere, and the results can be independently verified\u2014starting with auditable paper records, strong chain-of-custody, routine bipartisan risk-limiting audits, and straight, plain-language reporting of what was checked and what was found. We should pair that discipline with practical access, including reliable accommodations for voters with disabilities and well-run local polling options, so security doesn\u2019t become a barrier to lawful participation. Keep administration nonpartisan, enforce real consequences for proven fraud or misconduct, and invest in civic education and community outreach so people can see the process, understand it, and accept outcomes even when their side loses."
