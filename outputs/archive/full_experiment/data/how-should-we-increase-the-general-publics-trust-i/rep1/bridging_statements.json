At the same time, we should expand practical participation through early and secure mail voting, accessible polling places, and multilingual voter information so no community is left out. Finally, consistent civics and media-literacy education, protections for election workers, and accountable responses to mistakes or misconduct can keep the focus on fairness, inclusion, and integrity rather than partisan spin."
