    "statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014comes from doing the basics the way we do safety-critical work: clear rules, rigorous training, and documentation people can inspect. We should use voter-verifiable paper records, strict chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits with publicly posted results, and nonpartisan local oversight, while keeping voting practical and accessible through well-run in-person options and secure early or mail voting where allowed. Just as important, officials should communicate plainly and promptly about problems and fixes, and publish sustainability-minded plans for reliable, resilient systems that serve every community."
