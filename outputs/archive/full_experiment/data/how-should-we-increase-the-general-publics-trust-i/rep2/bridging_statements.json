    "statement": "To rebuild trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on simple, visible safeguards and clear communication: auditable paper trails (or equally verifiable records), routine independent post-election audits, and transparent chain-of-custody, with results explained in plain language and multiple languages where needed. At the same time, voting should stay practical for working people through well-funded local election offices, accessible polling places, and secure options like early voting and trackable mail ballots. When problems happen, officials should report them quickly, fix them publicly, and keep the process nonpartisan so people can verify the system without relying on political spin."
