    "statement": "Immigration policy should start with secure, well-managed borders and consistent enforcement so the system is credible, fair to legal applicants, and focused on public safety. At the same time, we should streamline legal entry and create an earned, time-bound path to citizenship for long-term, law-abiding residents\u2014built on background checks, paying taxes, learning English, and demonstrated community contribution\u2014while keeping families together and treating people with basic dignity. That approach protects the country, honors the rule of law, and strengthens communities by bringing responsible neighbors out of the shadows."

    "statement": "Immigration policy should be orderly and secure while staying grounded in human dignity: modernize border and visa systems with smart technology, thorough vetting, and consistent enforcement, and focus penalties on traffickers and serious criminals rather than families. At the same time, create a clear, affordable earned path to legal status and citizenship for long-term residents and Dreamers who pass background checks, pay taxes, learn English, and meet basic civics requirements, with strong protections for family unity and due process. Pair this with streamlined legal channels that match real workforce needs and guard against labor exploitation, so communities stay stable while newcomers can integrate and fully contribute."
