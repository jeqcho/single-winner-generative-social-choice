    "statement": "I think immigration rules should be clear and organized so everyone knows what to do, with safety checks, but also kindness so families and kids aren\u2019t scared or separated. If people have lived here peacefully, worked or helped their community, and followed the rules, there should be a fair path to citizenship that doesn\u2019t take forever, including chances to learn English. We can keep the border safe and stop bad people, while still welcoming families who need safety and want to belong."

    "statement": "Immigration policy should be built around clear, consistently enforced rules and a secure, well-managed border, while treating every person with basic dignity and due process. At the same time, there should be an earned, practical path to legal status and citizenship for long-term, law-abiding residents who work, pay taxes, pass background checks, learn English and civics, and show real community commitment. Keep families together where possible, focus enforcement on serious threats and repeat offenders, and pair the system with strong workplace accountability so employers can\u2019t exploit people or undercut wages. Done right, it strengthens public safety, community stability, and sustainable growth."

    "statement": "Immigration policy should balance compassion with the rule of law: secure borders, clear and consistently enforced rules, and humane treatment that protects families and children. For people already here who have put down roots, worked, paid taxes, and stayed out of serious trouble, there should be an earned, structured path to legal status and eventual citizenship that includes background checks, English and civics requirements, and reasonable fines\u2014without jumping ahead of those waiting legally. At the same time, we should streamline legal immigration to meet real workforce needs and crack down on criminals and employers who exploit illegal labor, so the system is orderly, fair, and trusted."
