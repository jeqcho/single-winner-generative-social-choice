For those already here with clean records who work, pay taxes, and have put down roots, there should be an earned path to legal status and citizenship that includes background checks, learning English, and meeting clear requirements\u2014without rewarding dangerous behavior or cutting in line. We should keep families together when possible, protect children and legitimate asylum claims with due process, and hold employers accountable so American workers and immigrants alike aren\u2019t exploited."

    "statement": "Immigration policy should be tough, fair, and orderly: secure the border, enforce the rules consistently, and fix the legal system so it\u2019s clear and doesn\u2019t drag on for years. At the same time, people who are already here and have a clean record, steady work, and family ties should have an earned path to legal status and citizenship\u2014through background checks, paying taxes and reasonable fines, learning English, and going to the back of the line. We should keep families together when possible, treat people humanely, and focus enforcement on criminals and repeat offenders, not working parents trying to do right. This approach protects American workers and communities while still honoring responsibility, faith, and basic decency."
