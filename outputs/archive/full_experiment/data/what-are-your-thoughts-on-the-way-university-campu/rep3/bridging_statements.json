    "statement": "Universities should protect peaceful free speech and protest\u2014even on the hardest issues\u2014while keeping campuses safe, orderly, and focused on learning. That means clear, content\u2011neutral rules for time, place, and manner, with firm, consistent consequences for harassment, threats, vandalism, or blocking access to classes and buildings, no matter who is protesting. At the same time, schools should offer structured forums and support so Jewish, Muslim, and all other students can be heard and feel secure without the institution taking political sides."

    "statement": "Universities should protect broad free speech and peaceful protest as part of learning, while enforcing clear, viewpoint\u2011neutral rules that keep classes accessible and draw a firm line at threats, harassment, dehumanizing rhetoric, and any targeting of students for their identity. Administrators should apply the same standards to everyone, be transparent about decisions, and avoid letting donors or politicians dictate who gets heard. At the same time, campuses should invest in structured teach-ins, moderated dialogue, and support services so grief and anger can be channeled into informed, compassionate engagement rather than intimidation or shutdowns."
