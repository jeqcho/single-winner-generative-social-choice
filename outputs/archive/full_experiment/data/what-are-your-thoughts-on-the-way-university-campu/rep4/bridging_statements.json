    "statement": "Universities should treat the campus as a forum for open debate and peaceful protest, protected by clear, viewpoint-neutral time/place/manner rules that are communicated up front and enforced the same for everyone. At the same time, administrators must draw a hard, consistent line at threats, harassment, intimidation, vandalism, or blocking access to classes and services, because free speech doesn\u2019t include taking away someone else\u2019s safety or education. Keep official leadership politically neutral, use de-escalation and structured dialogues to channel conflict into learning, and bring in law enforcement only when there\u2019s a credible safety risk or serious disruption."

    "statement": "University campuses should protect robust, even uncomfortable free speech and peaceful protest, while enforcing clear, viewpoint\u2011neutral rules that prevent harassment, threats, doxxing, vandalism, and disruptions that block others from learning or moving safely through campus. Administrators should communicate time/place/manner expectations transparently, apply consequences consistently, and rely on de\u2011escalation and student support services before turning to heavy policing. At the same time, schools should channel the energy into learning by hosting moderated forums, teach\u2011ins, and structured dialogue so students can argue hard issues with facts, empathy, and basic dignity for everyone."
