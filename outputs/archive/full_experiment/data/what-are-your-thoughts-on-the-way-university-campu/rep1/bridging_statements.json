    "statement": "Universities should strongly protect free speech and peaceful protest, while enforcing clear, content-neutral rules that keep campuses safe, classrooms functioning, and access to buildings open. Harassment, threats, vandalism, and targeting anyone for their identity\u2014antisemitism, Islamophobia, or any other bigotry\u2014must trigger predictable consequences, applied evenly no matter the cause. At the same time, administrators should lower the temperature by offering designated protest areas and structured, moderated forums where students can debate hard issues with facts and respect instead of intimidation."

    "statement": "University campuses should strongly protect free speech and peaceful protest\u2014including passionate criticism of governments and policies\u2014while enforcing clear, viewpoint-neutral rules that prevent harassment, threats, discrimination, doxxing, and disruptions that keep others from learning or accessing campus spaces. Administrators should lead with de-escalation, transparency, and consistent consequences, and invest in structured, educational dialogue (teach-ins, moderated forums, and support services) so students can engage hard issues with empathy and evidence. That approach honors both justice and safety, helping a diverse community advocate boldly without turning campus into an unsafe or hostile environment for anyone."
