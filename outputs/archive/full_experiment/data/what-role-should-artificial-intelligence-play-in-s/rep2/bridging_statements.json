We need practical, enforceable guardrails: strong privacy protections, transparency and independent audits for high\u2011risk systems, clear labeling when people are interacting with AI, and real liability when companies or agencies cause harm. AI shouldn\u2019t be used for mass surveillance, manipulation, or replacing workers without a plan for retraining and family stability. If we keep it aligned with human dignity, faith-and-family values, and stewardship of the natural world, we can encourage innovation without surrendering control to either Big Tech or unaccountable government."

    "statement": "Artificial intelligence should be adopted as a practical assistant that improves healthcare, education, and workplace efficiency while keeping people clearly responsible for high-stakes decisions, especially those affecting rights, jobs, or safety. We need clear, enforceable rules\u2014strong privacy protections, bias testing, transparency, and real liability for harm\u2014along with worker safeguards like consultation, retraining, and limits on intrusive surveillance. Used this way, AI can reduce busywork and open up time for the human parts of life and work that matter most, without letting power concentrate in unaccountable hands."
