    "statement": "Artificial intelligence should be treated like any powerful tool: used to improve safety, reliability, and sustainability in essential services like the electric grid, healthcare, and public infrastructure, while keeping trained people responsible for the final call. We need clear, enforceable rules\u2014privacy protections, independent audits for bias and security, and strict limits on surveillance\u2014so neither corporations nor government can misuse it. Any deployment that impacts jobs should include worker input, retraining, and a commitment to use AI to support skilled work, not replace it. If an AI system can\u2019t meet high safety standards and be shut off and overridden, it doesn\u2019t belong in the field."
