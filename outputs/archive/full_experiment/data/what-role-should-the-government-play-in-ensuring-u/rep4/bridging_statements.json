    "statement": "We should guarantee that every American can get basic preventive, primary, and emergency care without facing bankruptcy, while keeping private doctors and insurance in the mix so choice and competition still matter. The federal role should be to set clear nationwide minimum coverage standards, protect people with disabilities and preexisting conditions, negotiate down drug and hospital prices, and fund a strong safety net for veterans, seniors, and low-income families. In return, the system should demand transparency, crack down on fraud and waste, and reward healthy living and preventive care to keep costs under control."

    "statement": "The government should guarantee a universal baseline of affordable healthcare\u2014focused on preventive care, primary care, mental health, and true financial protection\u2014while preserving private doctors, hospitals, and insurance options for people who want additional coverage. That means clear national standards (including protections for preexisting conditions), strong cost controls through price transparency and negotiated drug and hospital rates, and income-based help so coverage isn\u2019t tied to a specific job. We should pair this with modern, secure, user-friendly systems that reduce paperwork and protect patient data, so access is simple, portable, and fair without turning care into a one-size-fits-all bureaucracy."
