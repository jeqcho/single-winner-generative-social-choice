    "statement": "Creo que el gobierno debe asegurarse de que todas las familias, especialmente los ni\u00f1os, puedan ir al doctor, ponerse vacunas y conseguir medicinas sin miedo a que cueste demasiado. Puede hacerlo pagando lo b\u00e1sico y poniendo reglas para que los precios sean justos, pero dejando que los doctores y hospitales sigan atendiendo como siempre.

    "statement": "I believe the government should guarantee that every American can afford a basic level of healthcare\u2014especially preventive care, emergencies, and essential prescriptions\u2014without turning the whole system into a one-size-fits-all federal takeover. Keep private doctors and private insurance for folks who want more options, but set clear rules that protect people with preexisting conditions, make pricing transparent, and rein in drug and hospital costs so working families and retirees on modest incomes aren\u2019t ruined by a medical bill. That strikes a fair balance between personal responsibility and our moral duty, as a country, to care for the sick and vulnerable."

    "statement": "The government should guarantee that every American can access a basic, affordable healthcare plan that covers preventive care, emergencies, and essential medications, with special priority for veterans, people with disabilities, and low-income families, while keeping private doctors and insurers in the mix to preserve choice. Washington\u2019s role should be to set clear standards, enforce price transparency, protect people with preexisting conditions, and crack down on waste and fraud so costs stay under control. States, community clinics, and local organizations should have flexibility to deliver care effectively, but no one should fall through the cracks because they\u2019re out of work, between jobs, or dealing with a serious condition."

We can keep choice and innovation by letting private providers and supplemental plans operate, while using strong cost controls, transparency, and protections like coverage for preexisting conditions to stop price-gouging and gaps in care. Fund it progressively and invest in community clinics and prevention so healthier students, families, and neighborhoods benefit now and long-term."
