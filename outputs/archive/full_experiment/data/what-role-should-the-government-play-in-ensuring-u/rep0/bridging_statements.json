    "statement": "Government should guarantee that every American can get essential, affordable care\u2014especially preventive care, emergency treatment, and support for seniors, the disabled, and low-income families\u2014so no one is ruined financially by getting sick. We can do that without a full federal takeover by setting clear nationwide protections (preexisting conditions, transparent pricing, limits on surprise bills), strengthening Medicare and community clinics, and offering a practical public backstop people can choose, while keeping private plans and local providers in the mix. The goal is a straightforward safety net that protects dignity and family stability, controls costs, and preserves choice and responsibility."
