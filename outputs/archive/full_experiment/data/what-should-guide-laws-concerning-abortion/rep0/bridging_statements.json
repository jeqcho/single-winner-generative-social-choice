    "statement": "I believe abortion laws should protect unborn life as much as possible while also keeping moms safe and respecting that some situations are heartbreaking and complicated, so clear medical exceptions must exist when a pregnancy seriously threatens a woman\u2019s life or health, and in cases like rape or incest. Instead of turning this into punishment, the law should pair reasonable limits\u2014especially later in pregnancy\u2014with real help: affordable prenatal care, counseling, adoption support, contraception, and support for families so women aren\u2019t pushed into a choice by desperation. If we do that, we can reduce abortions, protect life, and treat families with dignity and compassion."

    "statement": "Laws about abortion should be kind and protect people\u2019s health, with doctors and families (and their faith, if they want) making the hardest choices, not politicians. The law should try to respect both the mother and the unborn baby by keeping abortion safe and legal early on, and allowing it when the mother\u2019s life or health is in serious danger, while encouraging careful limits later with clear medical exceptions. At the same time, everyone should get strong support\u2014good health care, truthful learning, and help for parents and babies\u2014so fewer families feel scared or alone."

    "statement": "Abortion laws should keep women safe and respect personal liberty, while also acknowledging that potential life deserves greater protection as pregnancy advances, with clear, workable exceptions for threats to the mother\u2019s life or serious health, severe fetal abnormalities, and cases of rape or incest\u2014written so doctors can act quickly without fear. Government should set evidence-based medical standards and avoid ideology, while investing hard in prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, prenatal and mental healthcare, and adoption and family resources. The goal should be fewer crisis pregnancies, fewer abortions, and safer outcomes for families and communities."

    "statement": "Our abortion laws should start from a serious respect for unborn life while also protecting the mother\u2019s life and health, and they should include clear, workable exceptions for truly extreme circumstances, with decisions guided by medical judgment rather than political slogans.
