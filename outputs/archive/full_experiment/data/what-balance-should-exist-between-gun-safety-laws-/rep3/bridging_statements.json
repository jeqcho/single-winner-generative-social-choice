    "statement": "We can respect the Second Amendment and responsible gun ownership while treating firearms with the same safety-first seriousness we expect of anything that can quickly take a life. A workable compromise is universal background checks that close loopholes, safe-storage standards to prevent theft and accidents, and fair, due-process red-flag procedures for clear, documented risk\u2014paired with strong enforcement against trafficking and straw purchasing. Keep lawful paths open for hunting and self-defense, but require basic training and accountability so our communities, including our schools and the natural places we cherish, are safer."
