    "statement": "We should treat clean air, water, and a stable climate as non\u2011negotiable guardrails, while designing policies that keep jobs secure and energy reliable by leaning on predictable standards, market-based incentives, and technology upgrades. The practical path is to steadily tighten pollution limits, invest in clean power, efficiency, and resilient infrastructure, and pair it with strong training, wage protections, and benefit continuity for workers and communities affected by the transition. That approach protects the natural places many of us cherish while keeping the economy competitive and fair, and it holds major polluters accountable without punishing everyday households and smaller employers."
