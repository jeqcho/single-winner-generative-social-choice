The transition should be gradual and practical\u2014reward efficiency and cleaner technology, keep small businesses competitive, and expand job training so workers aren\u2019t left behind. Economic growth still matters, but it ought to be the kind that leaves our air and water cleaner and our towns more stable for the next generation."

The best compromise is clear, science-based emissions and pollution standards paired with market incentives and major investment in clean tech, efficiency, and resilient infrastructure\u2014so companies can innovate rather than just comply. A just transition has to be built in: training, wage support, and targeted help for small businesses and communities so good jobs grow as the economy decarbonizes."
