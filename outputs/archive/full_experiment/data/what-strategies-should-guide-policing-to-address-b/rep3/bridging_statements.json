    "statement": "We can protect both safety and civil rights by setting clear, enforceable limits on force, requiring body cameras and transparent independent review, and training officers first and foremost to de-escalate and treat every person with dignity. Police should focus on serious threats, while well-funded mental health and social-service crisis teams handle many nonviolent calls so a badge and a gun aren\u2019t the default tool. Like good conservation work, the aim is prevention and trust-building\u2014strong community relationships, fair data reporting, and real consequences for misuse of power\u2014so everyone feels protected rather than targeted."
