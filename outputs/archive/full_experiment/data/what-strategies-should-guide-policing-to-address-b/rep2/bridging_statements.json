    "statement": "We can protect public safety and civil rights at the same time by holding policing to clear, consistently enforced standards: rigorous de-escalation and crisis training, body cameras with real auditing, transparent data reporting, and independent investigation and discipline when force is misused. Pair that accountability with strong support for good officers\u2014smart staffing, wellness resources, and coaching\u2014so they can act decisively in real danger without burnout or shortcuts. Finally, shift many nonviolent mental-health and social-service calls to specialized civilian teams and invest in community partnerships, which reduces unnecessary confrontations and builds the trust that makes neighborhoods safer."

    "statement": "We can back law enforcement and still insist on high, consistent standards: strong de-escalation and decision-making training, clear use-of-force rules, and body cameras with independent review and real consequences for misconduct. At the same time, police shouldn\u2019t be the answer to every nonviolent crisis, so mental-health and social-service teams should take the lead where appropriate, freeing officers to focus on serious threats. If departments build steady relationships with families, churches, and local groups\u2014and treat everyone with dignity\u2014we can improve trust, protect civil rights, and keep communities safe."
