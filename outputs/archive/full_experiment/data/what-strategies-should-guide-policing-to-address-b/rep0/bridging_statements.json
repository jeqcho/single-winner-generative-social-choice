    "statement": "We can back law enforcement and still demand high, consistent standards: clear use-of-force rules with de-escalation as the default, body cameras, and swift, transparent discipline when an officer crosses the line. Police should focus on violent crime and serious threats, while mental-health and other nonviolent calls get routed to trained specialists so problems don\u2019t escalate. Community policing\u2014regular, face-to-face contact and local problem-solving\u2014builds the trust that keeps both public safety and civil rights on solid ground."
