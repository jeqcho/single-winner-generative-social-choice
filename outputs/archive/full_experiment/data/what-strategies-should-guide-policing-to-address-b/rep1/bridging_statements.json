    "statement": "We can support law enforcement and keep neighborhoods safe while insisting on clear, enforceable standards that protect civil rights: strong de-escalation and mental-health training, body cameras, transparent reporting, and independent review with real consequences for misconduct. Police should be freed up to focus on violent crime by pairing them with crisis and community services for nonviolent calls, while also giving good officers the staffing, equipment, and leadership they need to do the job without hesitation. If the rules are fair, consistent, and applied to everybody, it builds trust, strengthens public cooperation, and makes the whole community safer."

    "statement": "We can protect public safety and civil rights at the same time by holding officers to clear, enforceable standards: rigorous de-escalation and bias training, body cameras that stay on, transparent reporting, and independent review with real consequences for misconduct. At the same time, we should fully support good officers with strong leadership, adequate staffing, and the resources they need to respond decisively to violent crime without hesitation. For calls involving mental health, disability, or low-level nonviolent issues, pairing police with trained crisis teams and community partners can reduce needless confrontations and build trust. This approach respects the rule of law, protects constitutional rights, and makes it easier for every neighborhood to feel safe calling for help."

    "statement": "We can protect public safety and civil rights at the same time by making de-escalation the default, setting clear limits on force, and backing that up with consistent training, body cameras, transparent data, and independent oversight with real consequences for misconduct. Police should focus on serious threats while partnering with communities and schools, and we should expand non-police response for mental health and other nonviolent crises so armed officers aren\u2019t the automatic answer. Investing in prevention\u2014youth programs, social services, and environmental health in neighborhoods\u2014builds trust and reduces harm for everyone."
