    "statement": "We can cut down on litter with a common-sense mix of personal responsibility and practical setup: put plenty of well-marked trash and recycling bins where people actually gather, keep them emptied, and maintain public areas so they don\u2019t look neglected. Enforce existing anti-litter laws with meaningful fines for repeat offenders, with community service cleanup as an option, and use the revenue to support local cleanup and education. Teach respect for our neighborhoods and God\u2019s creation early through schools, families, and churches, and keep solutions local and straightforward\u2014not another big layer of bureaucracy."
