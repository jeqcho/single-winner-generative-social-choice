    "statement": "We can cut litter most effectively with a simple, common-sense mix: plenty of well-placed trash and recycling bins that are regularly emptied, plus clear signs and consistent enforcement of existing laws with meaningful fines. For repeat offenders, I\u2019d favor community service cleanup as a fair consequence that teaches respect without growing a bunch of new bureaucracy. And if we back that up with steady teaching in schools and through churches and local civic groups\u2014about personal responsibility and caring for God\u2019s creation\u2014we\u2019ll build the kind of community pride that keeps public spaces clean."
