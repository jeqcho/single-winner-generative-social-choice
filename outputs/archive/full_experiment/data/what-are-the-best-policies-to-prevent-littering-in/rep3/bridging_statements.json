Long-term change also requires education that starts with kids\u2014through schools and family-friendly community cleanups\u2014so caring for shared spaces becomes a habit and a point of neighborhood pride. And because the waste stream is shaped upstream, businesses and producers should share responsibility through cleaner storefront standards and incentives to cut unnecessary single-use packaging."
