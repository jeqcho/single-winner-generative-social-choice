Practical steps include preserving auditable paper records or verifiable digital trails, routine independent audits, strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody practices, and plain-language, multilingual reporting of results and incidents. Coupling these safeguards with accessible voting options, robust civic education, and open avenues for independent oversight and public feedback will demonstrate accountability, reduce misinformation, and help diverse communities trust that the process is fair.",
