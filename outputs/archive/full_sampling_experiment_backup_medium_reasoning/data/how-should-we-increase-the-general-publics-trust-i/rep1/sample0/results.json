      "We should rebuild public trust in institutions by combining greater transparency, independent oversight, and consistent accountability with meaningful public participation and clearer communication about decisions and outcomes. This balanced approach addresses calls for both reform and efficiency\u2014responding to demands for integrity and results while guarding institutions against politicization and needless bureaucracy. By measuring and publicly reporting performance, inviting community input, and enforcing clear ethical standards, institutions can regain credibility across diverse constituencies.",
      "While some people call for sweeping reforms and others urge protection of established expertise, most can agree that institutions earn trust through consistent fairness, competence, and openness. By committing to transparent decision-making, independent oversight, inclusive public engagement, and clear, measurable accountability for outcomes, institutions can address legitimate concerns about bias, secrecy, and inefficiency. Investing in accessible communication and civic education while safeguarding nonpartisan standards creates a practical path toward restoring and sustaining broad public confidence.",

      "Increasing public trust in institutions requires a balanced commitment to transparency, accountability, and meaningful public engagement while preserving the role of expertise and efficient decision-making. Institutions should make data and decisions accessible, establish independent oversight and clear remedies for errors, and create avenues for diverse communities to participate in shaping policies. This approach recognizes legitimate concerns about secrecy and competence, and seeks common ground by building mechanisms that both improve performance and ensure respect for citizens' voices."
