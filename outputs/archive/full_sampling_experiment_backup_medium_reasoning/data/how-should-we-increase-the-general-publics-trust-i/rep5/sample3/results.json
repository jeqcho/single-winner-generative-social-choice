      "To increase the public's trust in institutions, stakeholders across the political spectrum should commit to demonstrable reforms\u2014greater transparency, independent accountability, and consistent, evidence-based decision-making\u2014that make institutions more reliable and fair. At the same time, institutions should prioritize clear, accessible communication, protect privacy and the rule of law, and engage communities in meaningful participation so people see their interests reflected. Combining targeted institutional reforms with civic education and genuine opportunities for public input creates a shared path forward that both critics and defenders of current systems can support.",
      "To rebuild public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to greater transparency, independent oversight, and consistent performance while actively engaging communities and respecting expert judgment. By combining clear, accessible communication and measurable accountability with reforms that address inequities and protect democratic participation, institutions can demonstrate responsiveness to diverse concerns and restore confidence across the political spectrum.",
      "To rebuild public trust in institutions, we should combine genuine transparency and accountable oversight with efforts to strengthen competence and protect institutions from partisan capture. This requires clear, timely communication of decisions and data, independent audits and enforceable ethical standards, and more inclusive channels for citizen input and civic education so people see their concerns reflected. By balancing measurable reform and stability\u2014holding institutions to high standards while preserving expertise and the rule of law\u2014we can create systems that are both effective and widely trusted.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency, independent oversight, and clear accountability with sustained investments in citizen engagement and civic education. This approach respects calls for both necessary reform and institutional stability by making decision\u2011making more open, responsive, and demonstrably fair to diverse communities.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to transparent decision-making, independent accountability, and meaningful two-way engagement with diverse communities so policies are understandable, evidence-based, and respectful of individual rights. Recognizing that people value both effective governance and protections against abuse, institutions should publish clear data, welcome oversight and feedback, and correct mistakes openly. By combining measurable performance with ethical safeguards and regular community dialogue, institutions can rebuild confidence across differing perspectives."
