      "We can increase public trust in institutions by strengthening transparency, accountability, and meaningful public participation: institutions should proactively share clear information about decisions and outcomes, invite community input, and submit to independent oversight and regular performance reviews. This approach balances the need for competent, evidence-based administration with protections against abuse of power and discrimination, prioritizing responsiveness, fairness, and respect for individual rights.",
      "We can increase public trust in institutions by combining stronger transparency and accountability with genuine public engagement, so that decisions are evidence-based, clearly explained, and subject to independent oversight. This recognizes both the legitimate need to reform and discipline institutions when they fail and the value of preserving expertise and stable public services, while inviting communities to set priorities and evaluate outcomes. Committing to clear standards, timely communication, and accessible avenues for redress will help institutions earn trust from skeptical citizens and reassurance from those who rely on them.",
      "To rebuild public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to transparent decision-making, consistent and fair enforcement of rules, and routine independent oversight that addresses wrongdoing while preserving institutional stability. Institutions must also engage communities proactively\u2014listening to diverse perspectives, improving service delivery, and communicating clear, evidence-based explanations for policies\u2014so people see tangible results and understand trade-offs. Combining targeted reforms that increase accountability with protections against politicization, investments in civic education and a free press, and measurable progress metrics offers a practical path both critics and supporters can endorse.",
      "While some people call for fundamental reform of institutions and others emphasize preserving their stability and expertise, most agree institutions should be more trustworthy, effective, and accountable. We can bridge these views by committing to greater transparency and independent oversight, clear and accessible communication of decisions and outcomes, meaningful community engagement, and measurable ethical standards and performance benchmarks that protect impartiality and enable constructive improvement.",
      "To rebuild and broaden public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to transparent decision-making, independent accountability, and meaningful avenues for citizen participation. While some stakeholders prioritize stronger regulation and others emphasize institutional autonomy or efficiency, all can agree on clear, timely communication of evidence, regular third-party audits, and responsive channels for public input that demonstrate accountability. Prioritizing ethics, measurable performance, and accessible information will help institutions earn legitimacy across political and social divides."
