      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and independent accountability with meaningful public engagement and clear, consistent communication so that decisions and outcomes are accessible, verifiable, and responsive to citizens' concerns. This approach balances calls for reform and efficiency with protection against politicization by applying impartial oversight, ethical standards, measurable performance metrics, and safeguards for pluralism and the rule of law, while promoting civic participation and media literacy.",
      "We can increase public trust in institutions by combining stronger transparency and accountability with meaningful community engagement: institutions should publish clear, accessible information about decisions and outcomes, invite independent oversight, and respond promptly to legitimate concerns. This balances calls for efficiency and expertise with demands for checks against abuse, bias, and secrecy, acknowledging that people want both competent action and protection of rights. By coupling measurable performance, equitable treatment, and opportunities for public participation, we create a shared, practical pathway to rebuild confidence across diverse perspectives.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should commit to transparent, accountable, and responsive practices that both demonstrate competence and welcome public input. This means strengthening independent oversight and clear performance metrics while creating accessible channels for community engagement and diverse representation so institutions reflect and respond to the people they serve. By combining evidence-based decision\u2011making with honest communication about limitations and reforms where needed, institutions can rebuild trust across political and social divides.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, they should commit to transparent, accountable, and impartial decision-making while actively engaging citizens and stakeholders. This approach respects calls for stronger oversight and evidence-based expertise as well as concerns about overreach, by combining independent audits, clear anti-corruption rules, measurable performance metrics, and meaningful avenues for public input and local involvement. Consistent, plain-language communication, timely responsiveness to problems, and demonstrable results will help rebuild confidence across political and social lines.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pursue a balanced program of greater transparency, independent accountability, and routine public engagement so decisions are both evidence-based and responsive to community concerns. This respects calls for stronger oversight and anti-corruption measures while preserving the role of expertise, and emphasizes honest communication, predictable service delivery, and timely correction of mistakes. By creating accessible feedback channels and clear standards for performance and ethics, institutions can rebuild legitimacy across diverse constituencies."
