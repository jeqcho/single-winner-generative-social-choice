      "We should strengthen public trust by combining greater transparency, consistent accountability, and impartial oversight with improved communication and responsive service delivery. This balances the demands of critics for reform and the public\u2019s need for stable, effective institutions, and can be advanced through regular public engagement, measurable performance standards, and independent review mechanisms.",
      "While people disagree about which institutions deserve trust and why, much of the public\u2019s skepticism stems from perceived secrecy, unfairness, incompetence, and a lack of meaningful input. A practical consensus is to strengthen independent oversight and clear performance metrics, prioritize transparency and accessible explanations of decisions, protect impartial rule of law and press freedom, and create structured opportunities for genuine public participation and feedback. By committing to these measures and measuring progress openly, institutions can rebuild credibility while respecting diverse perspectives and protecting the common good.",
      "We can increase public trust in institutions by combining stronger transparency, independent accountability, and clear, consistent communication with active efforts to reduce politicization and protect professional independence. Institutions should make decisions and data accessible, invite meaningful public input, and provide measurable outcomes while safeguarding expertise and the rule of law. Complementing these reforms with civic education and accessible oversight channels creates shared responsibilities that diverse groups can support.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to transparent decision-making, consistent accountability, and accessible public communication while protecting independent oversight and the rule of law. This approach respects those who call for stronger regulation and those who emphasize efficiency by balancing clear standards, measurable outcomes, and regular public engagement. By inviting community input, publishing the evidence behind policies, and enforcing impartial checks, institutions can rebuild confidence across diverse perspectives.",
      "To rebuild public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and independent accountability measures with sustained investment in their competence and service delivery\u2014balancing oversight and public input without undermining expert decision-making. Policies should include clear performance benchmarks, accessible communication, protections against political capture, and meaningful opportunities for civic participation so people see results and have a voice. This approach respects those who call for rapid reform and those who value stability, creating practical, measurable steps that institutions and communities can jointly adopt."
