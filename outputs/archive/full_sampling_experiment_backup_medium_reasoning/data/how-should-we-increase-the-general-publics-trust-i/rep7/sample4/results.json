By combining credible safeguards with openness and civic engagement, institutions can rebuild legitimacy across the political spectrum.",

This approach respects differing concerns \u2014 those prioritizing stability and expertise and those demanding reform and public voice \u2014 by committing to measurable performance, open oversight, and regular public input to ensure institutions are competent, responsive, and legitimate.",
      "While people across the political and social spectrum may disagree about specific policies and which institutions deserve trust, most share a concern that institutions should be competent, fair, and accountable. A practical path to rebuild trust is to combine stronger transparency and independent oversight with accessible public communication, meaningful citizen participation, and measurable accountability for performance and ethics\u2014so institutions are both expert-driven and responsive to the public they serve.",
      "People across the political spectrum want institutions that are competent, fair, and responsive, even if they disagree about specific policies and how to achieve them; increasing public trust therefore requires combining the strengths of institutional expertise with stronger democratic accountability. A practical consensus is to commit to greater transparency and independent oversight, regular public reporting of outcomes, meaningful opportunities for community participation, and clearer, jargon-free communication\u2014measures that reduce corruption, improve performance, and let citizens see and evaluate that institutions serve the public interest.",
      "We can build broader public trust in institutions by committing to transparent, accountable, and evidence-based decision-making while ensuring meaningful public participation and protections for independent oversight. This approach respects both those who prioritize competent expertise and those who demand greater accountability and responsiveness, and it emphasizes clear communication, measurable results, and anti-corruption safeguards. By combining open data, regular independent audits, and accessible avenues for community input, institutions can demonstrate reliability and earn consent across diverse perspectives."
