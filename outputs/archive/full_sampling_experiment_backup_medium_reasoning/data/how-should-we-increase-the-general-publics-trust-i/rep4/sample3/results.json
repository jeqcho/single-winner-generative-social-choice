By committing to regular communication, accessible oversight, and demonstrable reforms, institutions can rebuild confidence across the political spectrum.",
      "To rebuild public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to transparent, accountable, and evidence-based practices while protecting the impartial rule of law and respecting legitimate local and cultural differences. Institutions should increase two-way communication and meaningful public participation, establish independent oversight and clear performance metrics, and promptly address corruption or incompetence to demonstrate responsiveness. By combining measurable reforms with open dialogue and civic education, we can create institutions that are both effective and legitimate across diverse constituencies.",

Institutions must also actively listen and respond to community concerns, incorporate diverse voices into governance, and demonstrate fairness and accountability through measurable reforms. By combining rigorous accountability with meaningful public engagement, we can build institutions that are both effective and legitimate in the eyes of the people.",

Recognizing diverse views\u2014including demands for expertise, fairness, and reform\u2014we should support oversight, conflict-of-interest safeguards, and measurable performance metrics while protecting impartiality and civil liberties. By committing to timely remedies for failures, regular public reporting, and inclusive civic education, institutions can rebuild credibility across the political and social spectrum.",

By committing to ethical standards, timely information, and safeguards against abuse, institutions can earn confidence across the political spectrum without sacrificing competence."
