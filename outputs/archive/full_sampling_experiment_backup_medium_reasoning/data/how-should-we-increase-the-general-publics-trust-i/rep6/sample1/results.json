      "To rebuild public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency, independent accountability, and demonstrable results with efforts to make institutions more inclusive and responsive to everyday people. This approach acknowledges legitimate calls for reform and oversight alongside concerns about preserving expertise and efficiency, and emphasizes clear standards, accessible communication, community participation, and measurable outcomes. By committing to open data, impartial review mechanisms, and regular public engagement, institutions can earn trust through fairness, effectiveness, and responsiveness.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to transparent decision-making, independent oversight, and regular, two-way public engagement. This approach recognizes both the need for expert, efficient governance and the public's demand for accountability and voice, and seeks to balance them through clear evidence-sharing, robust anti-corruption safeguards, and accessible channels for feedback. Consistent communication about goals and outcomes, plus demonstrable responsiveness when problems arise, will help rebuild confidence across diverse communities.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine clear, accountable governance\u2014through transparent decision-making, robust independent oversight, and measurable performance\u2014with greater public engagement that makes institutions responsive to everyday concerns. This balanced approach respects legitimate calls for reform while preserving institutional competence by protecting processes from undue politicization, enforcing anti-corruption standards, and ensuring independent review. By communicating openly about goals, trade-offs, and outcomes and creating accessible avenues for participation, institutions can earn legitimacy across diverse perspectives.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should adopt a balanced approach that combines transparent decision-making, independent oversight, and clear performance standards with meaningful avenues for citizen input and redress. This recognizes both concerns about bureaucratic inefficiency and fears of politicization or bias, and therefore emphasizes measurable results, protection of rights, and safeguards against corruption while streamlining processes to deliver reliable services. Regularly publishing accessible data, enforcing impartial accountability, and engaging diverse communities can build a shared foundation of credibility across political and social divides.",
      "To rebuild and strengthen public trust in institutions, we should combine greater transparency, consistent accountability, and meaningful public engagement so that decisions, evidence, and trade-offs are visible and understandable. Recognizing that some prioritize independent oversight while others emphasize expertise and efficient action, institutions can meet both needs by adopting clear standards, independent review, and open channels for input and feedback. By committing to ethical leadership, accessible information, and timely correction of mistakes, institutions can increase credibility and responsiveness without sacrificing the capacity to act."
