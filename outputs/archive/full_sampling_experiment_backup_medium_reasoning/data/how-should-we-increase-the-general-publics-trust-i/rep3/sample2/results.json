      "To rebuild and broaden public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to consistent transparency, independent accountability, and clear, evidence\u2011based decision\u2011making while guarding institutions from undue political influence. This requires open, accessible communication, meaningful community engagement and oversight, stronger ethics and whistleblower protections, and measurable performance metrics so citizens can evaluate results for themselves. By combining respect for professional expertise with genuine opportunities for public input and timely corrections when mistakes occur, institutions can demonstrate integrity and earn the confidence of people across the political and social spectrum.",
      "While some call for sweeping reforms and others emphasize preserving stable expertise, we can agree that institutions should earn trust through greater transparency, clear accountability, and demonstrable fairness. Practical steps include independent oversight and regular public reporting of performance and outcomes, stronger protections for impartial expertise and a free press, and routine opportunities for meaningful public input and community representation. By committing to measurable reforms, open communication, and equitable service delivery, institutions can rebuild legitimacy across diverse constituencies while retaining the capacity to act effectively.",
      "To rebuild public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and accountability measures with meaningful citizen participation, independent oversight, and clear protections for expertise and privacy. This balanced approach acknowledges calls for reform and efficiency while ensuring decisions are open, fair, and verifiable, making institutions more responsive, resilient, and resistant to misinformation.",
      "To rebuild public trust in institutions, leaders should combine greater transparency and accountability with meaningful public engagement, ensuring decisions are evidence-based and clearly explained. This approach respects healthy skepticism by instituting independent oversight and accessible channels for feedback, while also enabling institutions to deliver reliable services efficiently. By committing to openness, measurable performance, and citizen participation, diverse communities can find common ground in stronger, more trustworthy institutions.",
      "To rebuild public trust in institutions, leaders and organizations should commit to consistent transparency, independent accountability, and measurable results while respecting legitimate concerns about privacy and bias. This means providing clear, accessible information about decisions and outcomes, welcoming independent oversight and community input, and enforcing ethical standards to deter misconduct. Complementing these reforms with investment in civic education and accessible avenues for redress can bridge differing views by showing institutions are both competent and responsive to the public they serve."
