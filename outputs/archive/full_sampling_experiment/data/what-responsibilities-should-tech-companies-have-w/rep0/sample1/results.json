While perspectives differ on the balance between convenience, personalization, and security, a shared commitment to minimizing data retention, robust security practices, independent oversight, and meaningful consent can protect individuals without unduly hampering beneficial technological progress.",

This approach balances innovation and business needs with individuals\u2019 right to privacy, acknowledging both the value of data-driven services and concerns about misuse, and calls for accountable practices and oversight to maintain trust."
