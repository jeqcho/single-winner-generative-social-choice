    "Tech companies should commit to transparent, accountable handling of user data that balances innovation with respect for individual privacy: provide clear, accessible explanations of what data is collected and why, obtain meaningful consent for sensitive uses, and implement strong security and minimization practices. Regulators, civil society, and industry should collaborate to establish proportionate standards and oversight that protect users\u2019 rights without unduly stifling beneficial services, while allowing individuals reasonable controls over their data and remedies for misuse.",
    "Tech companies should respect user privacy by collecting only the data necessary to provide services, being transparent about what is collected and why, and giving users clear, usable choices about how their data is used. They should safeguard data with strong security practices and be accountable through independent oversight and meaningful remedies for misuse, while balancing innovation and legitimate business needs through proportionate, rights-respecting approaches.",
    "Tech companies should respect user privacy by minimizing data collection, being transparent about how data is used, and implementing strong security protections, while allowing users meaningful control over their information and options for informed consent. Recognizing that data is valuable for improving services and innovation, companies should balance responsible use with clear limits, independent oversight, and accountability to ensure trust across stakeholders.",
    "Tech companies should treat user data with transparency, accountability, and respect by clearly explaining what is collected, obtaining meaningful consent, and using data only for stated, beneficial purposes while minimizing retention. Recognizing the needs of innovation, security, and user personalization as well as concerns about surveillance and misuse, companies should adopt strong privacy-by-design practices, independent oversight, and user controls that balance product functionality with individual rights. This approach protects users\u2019 privacy, supports responsible innovation, and builds public trust across diverse stakeholder perspectives.",
    "Tech companies should respect users' privacy by collecting only necessary data, being transparent about what is collected and why, and giving people meaningful control over their information. While recognizing companies\u2019 need to innovate and sustain services, they should implement strong security measures, accountable governance, and clear consent options so users, regulators, and businesses can trust that data use balances utility, safety, and individual rights."
