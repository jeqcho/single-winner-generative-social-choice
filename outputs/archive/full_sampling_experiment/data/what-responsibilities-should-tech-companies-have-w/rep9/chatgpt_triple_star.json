    "Tech companies should respect user privacy by collecting only the data necessary for clear, user-beneficial purposes, implementing strong security safeguards, and being transparent about data use while giving people meaningful control over their information.  This balances the need for innovation and service improvement with protections against misuse: companies should be accountable through clear policies, accessible consent and opt-out options, and independent oversight or standards that protect users without stifling legitimate product development.",
    "Tech companies should respect user privacy by collecting and using only the data necessary to provide and improve services, implementing strong security controls, and being transparent about practices in clear, accessible terms. They should give users meaningful choices and control over their personal information while complying with legal protections, and work with regulators, civil society, and users to balance innovation, safety, and individual rights.",
    "Tech companies should be transparent and accountable in how they collect, use, and share user data, providing clear choices and meaningful consent mechanisms while protecting privacy by default through robust security and minimal data retention. Recognizing the value of data for innovation and public services, companies should limit data use to stated purposes, allow users to access and delete their data, and adhere to independent oversight and enforceable standards to balance user rights, business needs, and societal benefits.",
    "Tech companies should respect user data and privacy by implementing transparent practices, meaningful consent mechanisms, and strong security safeguards while allowing for responsible uses that deliver value to users. Recognizing concerns about both innovation and abuse, companies should be accountable through clear policies, independent oversight, and options for users to control how their data is collected and shared. This balanced approach protects individual rights without unduly stifling beneficial services and research.",
    "Tech companies should protect user data by default, using transparent practices, clear consent mechanisms, and strong security measures while allowing reasonable uses that enable useful services and innovation. Recognizing both the need for privacy and the benefits of data-driven features, companies should minimize data collection, provide meaningful user control and accountability, and comply with robust oversight and standards to balance individual rights with societal and business needs."
