By setting science-based environmental limits, using market tools and targeted public funding to incentivize greener practices, and ensuring social safeguards for workers and vulnerable populations, we can balance conservation with opportunity and share the benefits of a resilient economy.",

Recognizing diverse priorities\u2014from urgent conservation to job creation\u2014we should prioritize pragmatic, evidence-based approaches that create green jobs, protect critical ecosystems, and allow businesses and communities to adapt, ensuring long-term wellbeing for both people and nature.",
      "We should pursue a pragmatic balance that protects essential ecosystems and public health while enabling sustainable economic opportunities, recognizing that long-term prosperity depends on a healthy environment.

By recognizing both the urgent need to safeguard ecosystems and the legitimate needs for livelihoods and development, governments, businesses, and communities can collaborate on pragmatic solutions \u2014 such as clean technologies, circular economy practices, and targeted supports for transition-affected workers \u2014 that deliver long-term economic resilience and healthier environments for current and future generations.",
