    "Sustainable prosperity requires that environmental protection and economic growth be pursued together rather than as opposing goals: policies should prioritize long-term ecological health while fostering innovation, job creation, and competitiveness through investments in clean technology, resource efficiency, and fair transition support for affected communities. By setting science-based environmental limits, using market tools and targeted public funding to incentivize greener practices, and ensuring social safeguards for workers and vulnerable populations, we can balance conservation with opportunity and share the benefits of a resilient economy.",
