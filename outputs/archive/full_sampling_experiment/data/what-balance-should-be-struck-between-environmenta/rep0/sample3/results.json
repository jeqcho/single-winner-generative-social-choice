      "Sustained prosperity and a healthy environment are mutually dependent, so policies should pursue economic growth that is environmentally responsible by investing in clean technologies, efficient resource use, and fair transition support for affected workers and communities. While recognizing legitimate concerns about costs and competitiveness, governments and businesses should adopt evidence-based regulations, incentives, and collaborative planning that protect ecosystems and public health while promoting innovation and inclusive economic opportunity.",
      "We should pursue an approach that protects vital ecosystems and public health while enabling sustainable economic opportunities, recognizing that long-term prosperity depends on a healthy environment. By investing in clean technologies, restoring natural capital, and designing policies that support workers and communities through transitions, we can balance conservation with responsible growth and share the benefits across society.",
      "Sustainable prosperity requires balancing environmental protection with economic growth by pursuing policies that safeguard critical ecosystems and public health while promoting innovation, jobs, and shared prosperity. By prioritizing cost-effective regulations, investment in clean technologies, and targeted supports for communities and industries in transition, we can reduce environmental harm without unduly constraining livelihoods, creating a more resilient economy that benefits current and future generations.",
      "Healthy, sustainable economies and a thriving environment are mutually dependent, so policy should pursue economic growth that internalizes environmental costs and invests in clean technologies and resilient infrastructure. By combining sensible regulation, market-based incentives, and support for innovation and worker transitions, we can protect ecosystems and public health while creating durable jobs and prosperity for communities.",
      "Sustainable prosperity requires balancing environmental protection with economic growth by prioritizing policies that foster innovation, green jobs, and efficient resource use so ecosystems are preserved while communities thrive. While stakeholders will differ on timing and scale, we can agree to pursue practical, evidence-based measures\u2014such as natural capital accounting, targeted regulations, and incentives for clean technology\u2014that minimize ecological harm without unduly stifling opportunity and ensure a fair transition for affected workers and regions."
