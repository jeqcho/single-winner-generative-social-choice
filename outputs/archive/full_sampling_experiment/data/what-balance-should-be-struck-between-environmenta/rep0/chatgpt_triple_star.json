While recognizing legitimate concerns about costs and competitiveness, governments and businesses should adopt evidence-based regulations, incentives, and collaborative planning that protect ecosystems and public health while promoting innovation and inclusive economic opportunity.",
    "We should pursue an approach that protects vital ecosystems and public health while enabling sustainable economic opportunities, recognizing that long-term prosperity depends on a healthy environment. By investing in clean technologies, restoring natural capital, and designing policies that support workers and communities through transitions, we can balance conservation with responsible growth and share the benefits across society.",

By prioritizing cost-effective regulations, investment in clean technologies, and targeted supports for communities and industries in transition, we can reduce environmental harm without unduly constraining livelihoods, creating a more resilient economy that benefits current and future generations.",
    "Healthy, sustainable economies and a thriving environment are mutually dependent, so policy should pursue economic growth that internalizes environmental costs and invests in clean technologies and resilient infrastructure.
