By setting clear environmental standards, investing in clean technologies, and creating incentives for businesses to adopt sustainable practices, we can foster prosperity while safeguarding ecosystems and public health, ensuring economic opportunities are widely shared during the transition.",
      "Sustainable prosperity requires policies that protect critical ecosystems and public health while enabling responsible economic opportunities; by investing in clean technology, resilient infrastructure, and fair transition programs we can create jobs and growth without sacrificing the natural systems we depend on. Recognizing legitimate concerns about costs and livelihoods, we should pursue pragmatic, evidence-based measures\u2014such as phased regulations, incentives for green innovation, and targeted support for affected workers and communities\u2014that balance near-term economic needs with long-term environmental integrity.",
      "We should pursue a balanced approach that protects critical ecosystems and public health while enabling sustainable economic development, recognizing that long-term prosperity depends on healthy natural systems.
