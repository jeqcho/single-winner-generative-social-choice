      "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the popular will and that abolishing it outright raises constitutional and regional worries, the system should be reformed to better reflect voter preferences and increase fairness. A practical middle ground is to retain the Electoral College framework but implement measures such as the National Popular Vote interstate compact or proportional allocation of electors by states, paired with protections for smaller states\u2019 representation; these reforms would preserve federalism while making outcomes more closely aligned with the national popular vote. ",
      "While recognizing concerns about both the Electoral College\u2019s disproportionate influence on small states and the risk that a purely national popular vote could marginalize regional interests, we should pursue reforms that preserve state representation while enhancing democratic legitimacy\u2014such as adopting a National Popular Vote compact or instituting proportional allocation of electors by state. Any change should be implemented through transparent, constitutionally grounded processes and include safeguards to protect minority and regional voices, promote voter access, and ensure an election system that reflects both majority will and federal principles.",
      "While recognizing concerns about both democratic equality and the protections the Electoral College was designed to provide, the United States should pursue targeted reforms that make presidential elections more representative without discarding safeguards for smaller states and regional interests. Practical steps\u2014such as allocating electoral votes by congressional district, adopting the National Popular Vote compact, or enhancing safeguards against faithless electors\u2014should be evaluated and implemented only if they increase voter equality, preserve federalism, and receive broad bipartisan support through clear legislative or constitutional processes.",
      "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the popular will and that small-state protections and federalism are also important, we should pursue targeted reforms that enhance democratic legitimacy without upending the constitutional balance. Practical steps\u2014such as adopting the National Popular Vote interstate compact, refining how faithless electors are treated, and encouraging proportional allocation of electors where feasible\u2014can increase voter equality and turnout while preserving states\u2019 roles in presidential elections. These measures aim to bridge priorities for majority representation and state interests through incremental, legally durable changes.",
      "While some advocate abolishing the Electoral College in favor of a national popular vote and others defend it as a safeguard for federalism and smaller states, a pragmatic path forward is to retain the constitutional framework while implementing targeted reforms to enhance fairness and public trust. These could include adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or reallocating electoral votes by congressional district with safeguards to prevent extreme gerrymandering, improving ballot access and voter education, and exploring bipartisan commissions to set clear rules so that every vote carries more equal weight without abrupt disruption to the federation\u2019s balance."
