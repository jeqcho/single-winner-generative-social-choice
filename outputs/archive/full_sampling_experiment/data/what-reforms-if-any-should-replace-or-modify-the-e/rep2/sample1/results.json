      "While recognizing concerns about both state representation and democratic equality, we should reform the Electoral College to preserve federalism and majority legitimacy by adopting measures such as proportional allocation of electoral votes, a national popular vote compact with safeguards for small-state interests, or a preferential voting system within states; any change should be enacted through a transparent, bipartisan process that protects minority rights, ensures accurate vote counting, and maintains incentives for candidates to campaign broadly rather than only in a few swing states.",
      "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the popular will and that it protects federalism and smaller states\u2019 influence, the system should be updated to increase both fairness and public confidence. A broadly acceptable reform would retain state-based electors but allocate them more proportionally and adopt a national popular-vote backup (such as a safeguard threshold or contingency runoff) to ensure the winner reflects broad voter support without entirely discarding the constitutional role of states. This approach balances respect for diverse constitutional interests with the goal of making every vote matter.",
      "While recognizing concerns about both disproportionate state influence and the loss of local voice, we should reform the Electoral College to preserve federalism while enhancing fairness and voter equality\u2014by adopting measures such as proportional allocation of electors within states, eliminating faithless electors, and exploring interstate compacts that ensure the national popular vote winner without abolishing state roles. These changes aim to respect state interests and regional representation while reducing distortions and incentives that undermine voter confidence in presidential elections.",
      "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the popular will and that abolishing it outright raises constitutional and regional objections, we should pursue pragmatic reforms that enhance fairness and public confidence without abrupt systemic upheaval. Possible consensus measures include adopting the National Popular Vote interstate compact or proportional allocation of electors by states, paired with safeguards for coalition-building and minority interests; these approaches aim to better align outcomes with voters\u2019 preferences while preserving federalism and encouraging cross-state engagement.",
      "While recognizing concerns about both unequal state influence and the potential for national popular vote to marginalize regional interests, a pragmatic reform would preserve federalism by keeping state-based electors but allocate them in a manner that increases proportionality and turnout (for example, by adopting a proportional or district-based allocation with safeguards for minority representation). This approach balances the goal of reflecting the national popular will with protecting smaller states\u2019 voice, and should be coupled with reforms to ballot access and voting administration to ensure fairness and public confidence."
