    "While recognizing the Electoral College's role in balancing state and regional interests and concerns about disproportional influence, we should pursue measured reforms that increase democratic legitimacy and voter equity\u2014such as abolishing faithless electors, adopting proportional electoral vote allocation or the National Popular Vote compact for states willing to join, and improving ballot access and voter education. These changes aim to preserve federalism and protect smaller states' voices while ensuring that each vote carries more equal weight and that election outcomes reflect the popular will.",
    "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the national popular will and that abolishing it outright raises constitutional and federalist challenges, we should pursue reforms that enhance democratic legitimacy while preserving states\u2019 roles in presidential selection. Practical middle-ground changes\u2014such as adopting the National Popular Vote interstate compact, allocating electoral votes proportional to statewide results, and ensuring uniform voting access and counting standards\u2014can reduce distortions, increase voter equality, and respect diverse state interests without requiring immediate constitutional amendment.",
    "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the popular will and that its abolition would face constitutional and political hurdles, we should pursue pragmatic reforms that enhance democratic legitimacy without upending federal balance. Practical steps\u2014such as allocating electors by congressional district, adopting the National Popular Vote compact, improving ballot access and voter education, and ensuring transparency in vote counting\u2014can mitigate perceived unfairness while preserving state interests; these measures offer a middle path that respects both the principle of majority rule and the constitutional role of states in presidential elections.",
    "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the popular will and that abolishing it raises constitutional and federalist challenges, the United States should pursue reforms that both enhance democratic legitimacy and preserve state interests. Practical steps\u2014such as adopting a national popular vote compact, awarding electoral votes proportionally within states, improving ballot access and voter education, and considering a constitutional dialogue for long-term change\u2014can reduce distortions while respecting regional representation. These measures can be implemented incrementally to build bipartisan trust and assess effects before pursuing more sweeping amendments.",
    "While respecting the Constitution and the value of state representation, we should pursue pragmatic reforms that make presidential elections more reflective of the popular will without discarding federalism\u2014such as adopting the National Popular Vote interstate compact, refining state-level allocation of electoral votes to better reflect voter preferences, and ensuring secure, uniform voting procedures. These measures balance concerns about minority and rural representation with the goal of equalizing each citizen\u2019s influence, and they should be implemented through transparent, incremental steps and ongoing bipartisan review."
