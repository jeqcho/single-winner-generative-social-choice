      "While some advocate abolishing the Electoral College in favor of a national popular vote and others defend it as a protector of federalism and smaller states, a balanced reform path would preserve state role in presidential elections while enhancing the democratic principle of equal voter influence. Practical compromises could include adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or a proportional allocation of electoral votes, combined with measures to increase transparency, ballot access, and voter education to ensure outcomes reflect both broad public support and respect for federalist principles.",
      "The electoral college should be reformed to better reflect the popular will while preserving federalism and state interests \u2014 for example, by adopting a proportional or district-based allocation of electors or by ensuring stronger safeguards for faithless electors and clearer contingency procedures. This approach acknowledges concerns that a pure national popular vote could marginalize smaller states and that blunt retention of the current system can distort outcomes, offering a pragmatic middle path that improves fairness, transparency, and public trust.",
      "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the popular will and that it protects the interests of smaller states, a pragmatic reform package would keep an institution that preserves federalism while ensuring election outcomes more closely reflect national voter preferences. This could include adopting a national popular tiebreaker or a proportional allocation of electoral votes within states, along with stronger safeguards for ballot access and vote counting to bolster legitimacy \u2014 balancing efficiency, fairness, and state representation. ",
      "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the popular will and that its abolition would require a difficult constitutional overhaul, we should pursue reforms that increase fairness and public confidence without upending federalism. Practical steps\u2014such as adopting the National Popular Vote interstate compact, allocating electors by congressional district with safeguards against gerrymandering, or exploring ranked-choice voting for presidential contests\u2014can be piloted and evaluated to balance majority representation with protection for smaller states. These measures aim to preserve the federation\u2019s role in presidential selection while making outcomes more reflective of voters' preferences and reducing incentives for partisan manipulation.",
      "While some advocate abolishing the Electoral College entirely and others seek to preserve it to protect smaller states, a practical middle ground is to reform its operation to better reflect the national popular will while retaining elements that protect regional interests. This could include adopting the National Popular Vote Compact or moving to proportional allocation of electors within states, combined with safeguards such as a small minimum number of electors per state to ensure less-populated areas retain a voice. Such reforms aim to increase voter equality and turnout while acknowledging concerns about federalism and minority rights, and should be enacted through broad bipartisan negotiation and clear legal pathways."
