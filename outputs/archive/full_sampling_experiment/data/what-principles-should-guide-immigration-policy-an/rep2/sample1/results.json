      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and border integrity with compassion for immigrants, creating a fair and orderly path to citizenship that rewards contributions, ensures security, and preserves national values. By combining enforceable entry and employment rules with humane treatment, due process, and practical pathways for long-term residents and high-skilled workers, policymakers can address economic needs, family unity, and public safety while respecting diverse perspectives on national identity and fairness.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with a humane, orderly process that recognizes immigrants' economic contributions and family ties. By combining clear, enforceable entry and enforcement rules with streamlined legal pathways, background checks, and targeted humanitarian protections, we can uphold national interests while offering a fair, attainable path to citizenship for those who meet established legal and civic criteria.",
      "Immigration policy should balance border security and rule of law with humanity and economic openness by enforcing clear, fair rules while providing realistic, earned pathways to citizenship for long-term residents who contribute to their communities. Recognizing concerns about safety, jobs, and fiscal impact, policies should include robust vetting, labor and integration supports, and streamlined legal channels to reduce irregular migration, while ensuring due process and family unity so the system is practical, humane, and sustainable.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security, economic needs, and humanitarian commitments by establishing fair, transparent rules that prioritize orderly legal pathways, border integrity, and timely adjudication. It should recognize the value immigrants bring to communities and the importance of enforcing laws, offering a realistic, earned path to citizenship for long-term residents who meet clear requirements such as background checks, taxes, and integration steps, while also protecting vulnerable populations and preserving sovereign control over admissions.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with a humane, practical pathway to citizenship that recognizes immigrants\u2019 contributions to the economy and society. Policies should combine fair, enforceable rules and efficient procedures with measures that protect national security and labor markets, while offering opportunities for integration, family unity, and regularization for long-standing, law-abiding residents. This approach acknowledges concerns about sovereignty and resources while creating predictable, transparent pathways that uphold human dignity and enable immigrants to fully participate in and strengthen their communities."
