This balanced approach acknowledges differing priorities\u2014sovereignty and public safety on one hand, and compassion and opportunity on the other\u2014while seeking practical reforms that strengthen communities and the economy.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and national security with a humane, fair process that recognizes economic needs and family unity; pathways to citizenship ought to be earned through clear requirements, background checks, and contributions to the community while allowing for compassionate exceptions. By combining orderly, enforceable rules with opportunities for legal integration\u2014such as skills-based visas, family reunification, and measured routes from temporary status to permanent residency\u2014society can uphold borders and sovereignty while affirming shared values of opportunity and human dignity.",
      "An immigration policy should balance national security and economic needs with respect for human dignity by enforcing orderly, fair processes that prioritize border integrity, merit and family reunification, and humanitarian protections. It should create a clear, attainable path to citizenship for long-term residents who meet reasonable requirements\u2014such as background checks, tax compliance, employment or community contribution, and language or civics preparation\u2014while addressing labor market demands and investing in efficient, humane administration; this approach recognizes both the need for lawful immigration controls and the moral and practical benefits of integrating people who are already contributing to society.",
      "Immigration policy should balance a secure, orderly system with compassion for families and recognition of immigrants' economic and cultural contributions, by enforcing clear, fair rules while providing humane pathways for those who meet established criteria.
