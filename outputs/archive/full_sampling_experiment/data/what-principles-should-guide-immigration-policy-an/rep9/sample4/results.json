By combining orderly, enforceable rules with opportunities for legal integration\u2014such as skills-based visas, family reunification, and measured routes from temporary status to permanent residency\u2014society can uphold borders and sovereignty while affirming shared values of opportunity and human dignity.",

It should create a clear, attainable path to citizenship for long-term residents who meet reasonable requirements\u2014such as background checks, tax compliance, employment or community contribution, and language or civics preparation\u2014while addressing labor market demands and investing in efficient, humane administration; this approach recognizes both the need for lawful immigration controls and the moral and practical benefits of integrating people who are already contributing to society.",
