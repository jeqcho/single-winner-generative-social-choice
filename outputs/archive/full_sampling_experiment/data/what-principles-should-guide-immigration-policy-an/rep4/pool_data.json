There should be a realistic, clearly defined path to citizenship for long-term residents, especially those who work, pay taxes, and have U.S.-born kids, along with protections for Dreamers. We should prioritize family unity, refugees fleeing real danger, and high-skill immigration that keeps the U.S. competitive in fields like technology, while avoiding policies that demonize people based on where they come from.",
