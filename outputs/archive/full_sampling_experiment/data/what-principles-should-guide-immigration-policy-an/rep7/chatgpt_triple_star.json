    "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with a humane, orderly process that recognizes immigrants\u2019 contributions and the United States\u2019 values. A fair path to citizenship should combine clear, attainable requirements\u2014such as background checks, taxes, and language or civic knowledge\u2014with opportunities for families and high-demand workers to regularize status, while preserving discretion to address security and labor-market needs. This approach acknowledges concerns about sovereignty and legal process while honoring economic realities and humanitarian obligations, seeking practical compromises that strengthen community integration and shared prosperity.",
    "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and national security with compassion and economic practicality, creating a fair, transparent path to citizenship for those who contribute to their communities while addressing border integrity and labor needs. By combining enforceable standards\u2014such as background checks, language and civics requirements, and orderly processing\u2014with humanitarian protections for refugees and families, policymakers can honor diverse values and build public trust. This pragmatic approach recognizes both the needs of the nation and the dignity of newcomers, seeking durable solutions through bipartisan, evidence-based reforms.",
    "Immigration policy should balance the needs for secure, well-managed borders with a humane, orderly path to citizenship that recognizes immigrants' contributions to the economy and society. Policies ought to uphold the rule of law and prioritize public safety while providing realistic, fair avenues for undocumented residents and aspiring immigrants to regularize status through clear requirements, background checks, and opportunities for integration such as language, work, and civic education. This approach respects legitimate concerns about enforcement and resources while acknowledging humanitarian obligations and the benefits of a diverse, stable population.",
    "Immigration policy should balance humane treatment and national interests by creating orderly, fair pathways that secure borders, enforce laws, and recognize economic and humanitarian contributions of immigrants. Policies should combine realistic enforcement and visa systems with attainable routes to citizenship for those who meet clear requirements\u2014such as background checks, work or community service, and payment of fees or fines\u2014while preserving due process and family unity. This approach acknowledges legitimate concerns about sovereignty and security as well as the moral and economic arguments for welcoming newcomers, and seeks pragmatic reforms that build public trust and integration.",
    "Immigration policy should balance a secure, orderly system that enforces the rule of law with humane, practical pathways to legal status that recognize economic needs, family unity, and long-standing contributions by immigrants. While some emphasize enforcement and others prioritize inclusion, common ground exists in strengthening border security and immigration infrastructure alongside clear, attainable routes to citizenship, rigorous background checks, and opportunities for integration such as language, job training, and civic orientation. This approach protects national interests, upholds human dignity, and fosters social cohesion by ensuring fairness, accountability, and predictable outcomes for applicants and communities alike."
