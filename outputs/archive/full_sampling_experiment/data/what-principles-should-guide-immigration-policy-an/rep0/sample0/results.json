A shared pathway to citizenship should include clear, achievable requirements\u2014such as background checks, payment of fines or taxes, and demonstrated commitment to civic integration\u2014while providing protections for vulnerable individuals and mechanisms to address labor needs and family unity. This compromise respects concerns about orderly borders and sovereignty while offering practical, compassionate solutions that strengthen communities and the economy.",
