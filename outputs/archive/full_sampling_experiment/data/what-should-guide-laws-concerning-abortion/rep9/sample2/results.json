Policy should protect bodily autonomy and equitable access to services, include safeguards for minors and conscientious medical practice, and prioritize comprehensive sex education and supportive services that reduce unwanted pregnancies and support those who choose to parent.

      "Laws on abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy and the moral concerns about fetal life by protecting access to safe, legal care while allowing reasonable, evidence-based limits that reflect public health, maternal wellbeing, and gestational development. Policymaking should prioritize reducing unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education and contraception, ensure equitable healthcare access, and include safeguards for informed consent and exceptions where pregnancy endangers the health or life of the pregnant person, recognizing the sincere ethical differences across society.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should protect the health, autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people while also recognizing profound moral concerns about fetal life by ensuring safe, timely access to reproductive healthcare alongside reasonable limits informed by medical evidence and respect for conscience. Policy should prioritize reducing unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education and accessible contraception, support parents and children with robust social services, and ensure that any restrictions are narrowly tailored, medically sound, and protect the clinician\u2013patient relationship.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy and bodily integrity with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential human life by ensuring safe, legal access to reproductive health care while permitting reasonable limits that reflect genuine medical, ethical, or developmental considerations. Policies should prioritize evidence-based medical guidance, equitable access to contraception and support for parents and families, and protections for those with conscientious objections, so that legal frameworks reduce harm, safeguard health, and accommodate deeply held moral views without criminalizing or unduly restricting care."
