Policy should focus on minimizing harm\u2014providing comprehensive reproductive healthcare, accurate information, and support for families\u2014while accommodating conscience protections for providers and recognizing the diverse moral convictions held by citizens.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant people\u2019s autonomy and bodily integrity with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential human life, allowing early access while imposing reasonable, evidence-based safeguards as pregnancy progresses. Policy should be informed by medical science, prioritize equitable access to healthcare and supportive services, and include exceptions for serious health risks, ensuring decisions are made with compassion and without criminalizing those seeking or providing care.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should protect individuals' health, dignity, and ability to make personal medical decisions while also respecting sincerely held moral concerns about fetal life by setting clear, evidence-based limits and supports. Policy should ensure safe, timely access to reproductive healthcare, meaningful counseling, and social services that reduce unwanted pregnancies and support parents, while permitting narrowly defined restrictions grounded in medical necessity, gestational viability, and widely shared protections for maternal health."
