Policy should be guided by evidence-based medicine, respect for personal conscience, and support for pregnant people\u2014through comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and social services\u2014so that decisions are made in context rather than criminalized, with reasonable limits informed by medical viability and compelling state interests.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should protect public health and individual safety while respecting deeply held moral convictions by ensuring access to safe, timely medical care and supporting informed, voluntary decisions. Policy should balance the rights and well\u2011being of pregnant people with reasonable limits informed by medical evidence, gestational considerations, and support for families, and be accompanied by measures that reduce unwanted pregnancies and expand access to contraception, comprehensive sex education, and social services.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should protect individual autonomy and reproductive health while also recognizing ethical concerns about fetal life by ensuring safe, legal access with reasonable limits informed by medical evidence and gestational milestones. Policy should prioritize comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and maternal support services to reduce unintended pregnancies, and include exceptions and thoughtful regulations that reflect medical realities and respect sincerely held moral beliefs.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should protect the health, autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people while recognizing society\u2019s interest in fetal life, balancing access to safe reproductive care with reasonable, evidence-based safeguards. Policy should be informed by medical expertise, prioritize measures that reduce unwanted pregnancies (such as comprehensive sex education and contraception access), and allow time-limited limits only when supported by clear harms, ensuring exceptions for the life and health of the pregnant person and equitable access across communities."
