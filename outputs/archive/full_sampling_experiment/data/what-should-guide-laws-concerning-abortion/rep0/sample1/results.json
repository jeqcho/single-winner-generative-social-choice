      "Laws concerning abortion should protect individual autonomy and reproductive health while also recognizing ethical concerns about fetal life by ensuring safe, legal access with reasonable limits informed by medical evidence and gestational milestones. Policy should prioritize comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and maternal support services to reduce unintended pregnancies, and include exceptions and thoughtful regulations that reflect medical realities and respect sincerely held moral beliefs.",

Policy should be informed by medical expertise, prioritize measures that reduce unwanted pregnancies (such as comprehensive sex education and contraception access), and allow time-limited limits only when supported by clear harms, ensuring exceptions for the life and health of the pregnant person and equitable access across communities."
