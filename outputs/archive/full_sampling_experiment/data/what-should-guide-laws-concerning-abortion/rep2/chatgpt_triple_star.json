    "Laws concerning abortion should protect the health, dignity, and autonomy of pregnant people while recognizing society\u2019s interest in supporting fetal development, by ensuring safe, legal access to abortion alongside meaningful resources for prenatal care, childbirth, and parenting or adoption support. Policy should be guided by medical evidence, respect for deeply held moral convictions, and pragmatic protections\u2014such as clear limits on late-term procedures except for serious health risks\u2014paired with investments in education, contraception access, and social services to reduce unwanted pregnancies and help families thrive.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for personal autonomy with recognition of legitimate moral concerns about fetal life by ensuring safe, timely access to abortion services while allowing reasonable, evidence-based limits informed by gestational development and maternal health. Policy should focus on reducing unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education and accessible contraception, protecting healthcare providers' conscience rights within agreed standards, and ensuring decisions are guided by medical evidence, compassion, and support for families.",
    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy and bodily integrity with concern for potential human life, grounding policy in evidence-based medicine, public health, and compassion. Reasonable regulation can protect health and safety, ensure access to accurate information and timely care, and include exceptions or supports that acknowledge complex circumstances, while allowing room for conscience protections and compassionate counseling for those with moral objections.",
    "Laws governing abortion should protect individual autonomy and healthcare access while recognizing the societal interest in safeguarding potential life, balancing these aims through clear, evidence-based limits and supports. Policies should ensure safe, legal care is available, provide counseling and social services to those facing pregnancy, and allow reasonable, narrowly tailored regulations that reflect medical consensus and respect conscientious objections without unduly restricting access. ",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for personal autonomy with protection for fetal life by ensuring safe, legal access early in pregnancy while allowing reasonable limits agreed upon through democratic processes as gestation progresses. Policy should prioritize comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and maternal health care to reduce unintended pregnancies, and include clear exceptions to protect the health and life of the pregnant person, with measures guided by evidence, compassion, and respect for sincere moral diversity."
