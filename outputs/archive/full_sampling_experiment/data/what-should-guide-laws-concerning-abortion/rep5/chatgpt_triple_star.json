    "Laws concerning abortion should protect individual health, autonomy, and dignity while acknowledging society\u2019s interest in fetal well\u2011being by ensuring safe, accessible reproductive healthcare alongside reasonable, evidence\u2011based safeguards. Policy should be informed by medical best practices, respect for personal conscience, and practical supports\u2014such as comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and maternal care\u2014to reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion. By balancing reliable medical guidance, respect for differing moral perspectives, and measures that promote healthy families, laws can minimize harm and uphold shared values of compassion and responsibility.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy and bodily integrity with careful consideration for fetal development and the moral concerns of the community, recognizing that reasonable disagreements exist about when and how these values apply. Policy should protect access to safe, legal reproductive health care while allowing thoughtfully defined limits\u2014guided by medical evidence, respect for human dignity, equitable access, and support for parents\u2014to minimize harm and ensure that personal conscience and public interest are both fairly weighed.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy with a commitment to protect health and reduce harm, ensuring that decisions are made safely, compassionately, and based on best medical evidence. Policy should preserve access to necessary care, support people with resources and counseling, and allow reasonable limits informed by clear medical criteria and respect for plural ethical views.",
    "Laws governing abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy and reproductive health with consideration for legitimate ethical concerns about fetal life by ensuring safe, legal access to care while allowing reasonable limits based on gestational development and compelling state interests. Policy should prioritize evidence-based medical standards, protect the health and socioeconomic wellbeing of pregnant people, and include supports\u2014such as counseling, maternal health services, and family planning\u2014to reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should protect individual autonomy and health while recognizing society\u2019s interest in supporting potential life, by ensuring safe, legal access to reproductive care alongside meaningful support for parents and families. Policymaking should be guided by medical evidence, respect for diverse moral convictions, and pragmatic measures\u2014such as comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and social services\u2014that reduce the need for abortion and help people carry pregnancies to term when they choose.
