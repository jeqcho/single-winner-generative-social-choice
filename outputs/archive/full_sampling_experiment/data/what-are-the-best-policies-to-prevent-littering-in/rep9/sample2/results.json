      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced approach that combines clear enforcement of reasonable penalties with convenient infrastructure, such as well-placed bins and regular cleaning, and ongoing public education that fosters civic pride and responsibility. This strategy respects concerns about personal freedom and fair treatment by focusing enforcement on repeat or egregious offenders while investing in accessible disposal options and community-led campaigns to change norms.",
      "Effective prevention of littering in public spaces combines clear, consistently enforced rules with practical infrastructure and community engagement: visible bins, regular collection, and targeted public education reduce barriers and change norms, while fair penalties deter repeat offenses. This balanced approach respects concerns about personal responsibility and limited public budgets by prioritizing cost-effective measures, involving local stakeholders in solutions, and evaluating outcomes to adjust strategies over time.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced combination of clear regulations, accessible waste and recycling infrastructure, and sustained public education that respects individual responsibility and community standards. By pairing reasonably enforced penalties with positive incentives, convenient disposal options, and collaborative community cleanup programs, jurisdictions can reduce litter while accommodating both personal freedom and shared public-interest goals.",

This mix respects concerns about personal responsibility and effective deterrents while recognizing that accessible disposal options, signage, and local stewardship programs make compliance easier and foster shared civic pride."
