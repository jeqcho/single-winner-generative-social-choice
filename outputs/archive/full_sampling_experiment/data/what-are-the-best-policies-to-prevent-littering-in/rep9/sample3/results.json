This strategy respects concerns about personal freedom and fair treatment by focusing enforcement on repeat or egregious offenders while investing in accessible disposal options and community-led campaigns to change norms.",

This balanced approach respects concerns about personal responsibility and limited public budgets by prioritizing cost-effective measures, involving local stakeholders in solutions, and evaluating outcomes to adjust strategies over time.",
