While some emphasize individual responsibility and others prioritize policy or investment, communities can agree on balanced approaches\u2014providing more bins and signage, supporting outreach and youth engagement, and applying consistent, proportionate penalties\u2014to reduce litter while respecting equity and public resources.",
      "Effective prevention of littering in public spaces combines clear, consistently enforced rules with accessible infrastructure and public education: invest in sufficient, well-placed receptacles and regular cleaning, pair these with fair enforcement and visible consequences, and run community-focused campaigns that explain environmental and economic impacts. This approach respects concerns about personal freedom and government overreach by prioritizing convenience and voluntary compliance first, while recognizing the need for targeted enforcement and community stewardship where problems persist.",
