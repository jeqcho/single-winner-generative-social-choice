This balanced approach recognizes individual responsibility and the need for supportive public services, while allowing communities to tailor programs\u2014such as volunteer cleanups, deposit-return schemes, or targeted outreach\u2014to local values and budget realities.",

This approach respects differing views by pairing supportive measures that make responsible behavior easy and socially rewarded with clear, consistent rules that deter habitual littering."
