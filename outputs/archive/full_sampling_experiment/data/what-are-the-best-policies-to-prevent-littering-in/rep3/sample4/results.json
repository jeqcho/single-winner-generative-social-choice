By investing in convenient waste and recycling bins, consistent public education, and community-led cleanup programs\u2014while applying proportionate enforcement for repeat offenders\u2014cities can reduce litter without relying solely on punishment, respecting both environmental goals and individual circumstances.",

This approach respects individual freedom while protecting community health and the environment, and can be adapted to local needs and resources through stakeholder input and regular evaluation.",
