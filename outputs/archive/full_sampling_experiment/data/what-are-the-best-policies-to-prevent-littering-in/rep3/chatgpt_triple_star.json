    "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a combination of practical infrastructure, consistent enforcement, and community engagement: provide accessible, clearly labeled waste and recycling receptacles, enforce reasonable penalties for repeated offenders, and invest in education and local stewardship programs that build civic pride. This balanced approach recognizes the need for clear rules and consequences while also addressing root causes\u2014such as convenience, awareness, and social norms\u2014so that individuals, businesses, and government share responsibility for cleaner public spaces.",
