      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced mix of education, convenient infrastructure, and proportionate enforcement: public awareness campaigns and school programs cultivate civic responsibility, while adequate, well-placed bins and regular maintenance make proper disposal easy. Targeted fines and community-led initiatives can reinforce standards without criminalizing poverty, and transparent evaluation of programs ensures policies adapt to local needs and respect diverse viewpoints.",
      "Reducing litter in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced mix of clear regulations, practical infrastructure, and community engagement: enforceable fines and signage set expectations, ample and conveniently placed waste and recycling bins make compliance easy, and education campaigns plus volunteer cleanups foster local ownership. This combined approach respects those who favor stronger enforcement and those who prioritize education and services, while focusing resources on measures proven to reduce litter effectively.",
      "Effective prevention of littering in public spaces combines clear, consistently enforced rules with convenient waste and recycling infrastructure, supported by public education and community engagement. By pairing fair penalties for repeat offenders with positive incentives, local clean-up programs, and visible public information campaigns, communities can respect individual responsibility while addressing underlying causes such as lack of access to bins and awareness.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced approach that combines clear enforcement, accessible waste and recycling infrastructure, and sustained public education. While some prioritize strict penalties and others emphasize community engagement or convenience, most stakeholders can agree that consistent rules, well-placed bins, and campaigns that foster civic pride and practical incentives together reduce litter effectively and equitably.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces is best achieved through a combination of clear, consistent enforcement of anti-litter laws, accessible and well-maintained waste and recycling infrastructure, and public education campaigns that foster civic pride and responsibility. By pairing reasonable penalties for deliberate littering with convenient disposal options, community-led cleanup initiatives, and targeted outreach that respects different cultural and economic perspectives, municipalities can reduce litter while balancing fairness, cost-effectiveness, and personal freedom."
