By focusing on policies that target criminal misuse and mental-health crises, protect public safety, and preserve responsible ownership, we can respect constitutional rights while making communities safer for everyone.",

By focusing on measures that target risks rather than blanket bans, and by upholding due process and lawful use, we can build policies that honor responsible gun ownership and better protect communities.",

By focusing on background checks, mental-health interventions, safe-storage requirements, and enforcement of existing laws\u2014while preserving due process and lawful ownership\u2014we can reduce violence and accidental harm while honoring Second Amendment freedoms.",

By focusing on prevention, enforcement of existing laws, and improved mental-health and safety education, we can respect constitutional rights while enhancing public safety."
