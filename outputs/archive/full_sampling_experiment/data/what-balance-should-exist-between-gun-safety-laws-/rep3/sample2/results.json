By focusing on measures that target risks rather than blanket bans, and by upholding due process and lawful use, we can build policies that honor responsible gun ownership and better protect communities.",

By focusing on background checks, mental-health interventions, safe-storage requirements, and enforcement of existing laws\u2014while preserving due process and lawful ownership\u2014we can reduce violence and accidental harm while honoring Second Amendment freedoms.",
