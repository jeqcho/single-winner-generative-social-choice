      "Protecting public safety and upholding the Second Amendment are both vital goals; a balanced approach pairs reasonable, evidence-based firearm regulations\u2014such as universal background checks, safe storage requirements, and targeted prohibitions for those proven dangerous\u2014with robust protections for lawful ownership, hunting, and self-defense. By focusing laws on reducing harm and preventing access by high-risk individuals while preserving responsible citizens\u2019 rights and ensuring due process, policymakers can build bipartisan trust and practical solutions that respect constitutional freedoms and save lives.",
      "Protecting public safety and preserving the Second Amendment are both legitimate goals; a sensible balance respects lawful gun ownership while implementing evidence-based measures that reduce gun violence, such as universal background checks, safe storage requirements, and targeted restrictions on high-risk individuals and weapons. By focusing on policies that enhance responsible ownership, improve enforcement, and fund mental health and community violence prevention, we can uphold constitutional rights while meaningfully lowering risks to the public.",
      "We can uphold the Second Amendment while supporting sensible, evidence-based safety measures that reduce gun violence and protect communities\u2014such as comprehensive background checks, red flag laws with due process, secure storage requirements, and restrictions on access for those proven dangerous. By combining respect for lawful ownership and recreational use with targeted policies that prevent harm, we honor constitutional rights and advance public safety in ways that most stakeholders can accept.",
      "Respecting the Second Amendment while protecting public safety requires sensible, evidence-based laws that prevent gun violence without unduly restricting lawful ownership and self-defense. Common-sense measures\u2014such as universal background checks, secure storage requirements, red-flag orders with due process, and targeted bans on high-risk weapons or accessories\u2014can reduce harm while preserving responsible citizens\u2019 rights, and should be implemented alongside investments in mental health, community violence prevention, and firearms education.",
      "A balanced approach recognizes the constitutional right to bear arms while affirming the government\u2019s responsibility to reduce gun violence through narrowly tailored safety measures. Common-sense regulations\u2014such as universal background checks, safe-storage requirements, and prohibitions for those with violent criminal histories or severe mental-health risks\u2014can protect public safety without unduly burdening law-abiding gun owners, fostering a shared commitment to both individual rights and community security."
