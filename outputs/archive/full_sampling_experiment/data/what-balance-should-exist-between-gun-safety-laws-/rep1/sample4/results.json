Balancing rights and responsibilities in this way focuses enforcement on those who endanger others, preserves legitimate ownership, and makes everyday places\u2014schools, stores, worship spaces\u2014safer for everyone.",

      "Respecting the constitutional right to keep and bear arms while protecting public safety requires a balanced approach that preserves lawful ownership and responsible use alongside sensible, evidence-based restrictions to reduce gun violence. Common ground can be found in measures that enhance background checks, promote safe storage and training, and keep firearms out of the hands of those who pose a clear risk, while safeguarding hunting, sport shooting, and self-defense for law-abiding citizens.",
      "We can uphold the Second Amendment while adopting targeted, evidence-based safety measures that reduce gun violence\u2014such as universal background checks, safe-storage requirements, and prohibitions on access for people demonstrably at high risk\u2014without broadly disarming law-abiding citizens. By focusing on policies that protect public safety, respect responsible ownership, and include avenues for due process and regular review, we can build bipartisan support and practical solutions that address both security and constitutional rights.",
      "We can respect the Second Amendment while pursuing practical, evidence-based measures that reduce gun violence and keep communities safe, such as universal background checks, safe storage requirements, and prohibitions for those proven dangerous. By combining the rights of responsible gun ownership with targeted safeguards, we honor constitutional freedoms and protect public safety, and we commit to ongoing evaluation and dialogue to adjust laws based on effectiveness and civil liberties concerns.",
      "A balanced approach recognizes the constitutional right to keep and bear arms while advancing reasonable, evidence-based safety measures that prevent violence and protect the public. By focusing on universal background checks, safe storage requirements, and targeted restrictions for those demonstrably high-risk\u2014paired with respect for lawful ownership and recreational use\u2014we can reduce harm without undermining responsible gun ownership.",
      "We can uphold the Second Amendment while supporting sensible, evidence-based measures that reduce gun violence\u2014such as universal background checks, safe storage requirements, and targeted bans on weapons designed solely for mass casualty\u2014so long as these policies include due process and respect lawful ownership. By focusing on proven safety interventions, improving mental-health and community-based prevention programs, and ensuring transparent enforcement, society can protect public safety without eroding constitutional rights."
