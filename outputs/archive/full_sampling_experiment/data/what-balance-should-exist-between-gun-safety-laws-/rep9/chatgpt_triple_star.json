    "A balanced approach recognizes the constitutional right to bear arms while also prioritizing public safety by implementing evidence-based regulations that prevent access to firearms by those likely to cause harm, such as through background checks, red flag laws, and safe storage requirements. By focusing on targeted, enforceable measures that respect lawful ownership and enhance community protections, policymakers can reduce violence without undermining responsible citizens\u2019 Second Amendment rights.",
    "Protecting both public safety and the constitutional right to keep and bear arms requires sensible, narrowly tailored laws that prevent harm\u2014such as universal background checks, red flag measures with due process, and safe-storage requirements\u2014while preserving lawful ownership for self-defense, hunting, and sport. By focusing on evidence-based policies that target risky behavior and illegal access rather than broadly restricting rights, communities can reduce violence while respecting legitimate Second Amendment interests.",
    "Protecting public safety and respecting the Second Amendment are both legitimate goals; a balanced approach upholds the right to responsible firearm ownership while implementing evidence-based measures that reduce gun violence. Common-sense standards\u2014such as effective background checks, safe-storage requirements, red-flag mechanisms with due process, and targeted prohibitions for those proven dangerous\u2014can help prevent harm without broadly stripping law-abiding citizens of their constitutional rights.",
    "We uphold the constitutional right to keep and bear arms while recognizing the shared responsibility to reduce gun violence through sensible, evidence-based safety measures. Common-sense policies\u2014such as universal background checks, safe-storage requirements, and targeted restrictions for those demonstrably dangerous\u2014can protect communities without unduly infringing on lawful ownership, and should be paired with investments in mental-health services, education, and enforcement to address root causes.",
    "Protecting public safety and respecting the Second Amendment are both essential goals, so sensible gun policy should combine lawful access for responsible, law-abiding owners with targeted measures that reduce violence\u2014such as background checks, safe storage requirements, and enforcement against illegal trafficking. By focusing on evidence-based regulations that prevent misuse while preserving recreational and self-defense rights, policymakers can build consensus across perspectives and continually assess outcomes to balance liberty with community safety."
