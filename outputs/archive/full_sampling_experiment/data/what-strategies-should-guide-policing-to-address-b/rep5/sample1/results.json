      "Policing should balance proactive public safety with unwavering respect for civil rights by emphasizing de-escalation, transparency, and accountability alongside evidence-based crime prevention and community partnership. While recognizing the need for effective enforcement to protect people and property, agencies should adopt clear limits on use of force, independent oversight, data-driven policies, and robust training to build trust and ensure fair treatment for all.
