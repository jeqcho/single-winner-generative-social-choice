Recognizing the legitimate concerns of communities for safety and of advocates for justice, departments should adopt evidence-based practices, community engagement, independent oversight, and clear policies that minimize biased enforcement and excessive force. By measuring outcomes, sharing data openly, and continuously refining practices with community input, law enforcement can build trust and legitimacy while maintaining order and protecting everyone's rights.",
