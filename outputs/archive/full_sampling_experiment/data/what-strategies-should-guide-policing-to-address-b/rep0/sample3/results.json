Recognizing the need for effective law enforcement, agencies should limit intrusive tactics, ensure transparency and independent oversight, invest in de-escalation and bias-awareness training, and collaborate with community stakeholders to build trust and address underlying causes of crime.",
      "Policing should be guided by strategies that simultaneously protect public safety and uphold civil rights by prioritizing de-escalation, transparency, and accountability while ensuring officers have the training and resources needed to respond effectively. Recognizing the legitimate concerns of communities for safety and of advocates for justice, departments should adopt evidence-based practices, community engagement, independent oversight, and clear policies that minimize biased enforcement and excessive force. By measuring outcomes, sharing data openly, and continuously refining practices with community input, law enforcement can build trust and legitimacy while maintaining order and protecting everyone's rights.",

While recognizing differing views on methods and priorities, agencies should adopt clear policies on use of force, impartial training, independent oversight, and investment in community services so that enforcement is effective, respects individual liberties, and earns public trust.",
