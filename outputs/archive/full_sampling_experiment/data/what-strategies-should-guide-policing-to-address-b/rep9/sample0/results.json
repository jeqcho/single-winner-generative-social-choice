      "Policing should prioritize public safety while steadfastly protecting civil rights by combining transparent, accountable practices with community partnership and clear, rights-respecting use-of-force standards. Recognizing that communities and officers both seek secure neighborhoods, policies should invest in training, de-escalation, bias mitigation, and independent oversight alongside robust support for mental-health and social services to reduce confrontations. This balanced approach honors the need for effective law enforcement while ensuring that enforcement is fair, impartial, and subject to meaningful review."
