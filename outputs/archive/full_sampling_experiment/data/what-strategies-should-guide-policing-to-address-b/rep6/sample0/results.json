      "Policing should prioritize both public safety and the protection of civil rights by combining community-led prevention, transparent accountability, and evidence-based tactics that minimize harm. While recognizing the need for effective law enforcement to reduce crime, agencies must build trust through independent oversight, clear use-of-force limits, regular bias and de-escalation training, and investment in non-police alternatives for mental health and social services. These measures balance the perspectives that emphasize security with those demanding liberty and fairness, fostering safer communities where rights are respected.",

By combining clear standards of conduct, independent oversight, de-escalation and bias-reduction training, and community-informed policing strategies, agencies can reduce harm, improve legitimacy, and ensure equitable treatment for all residents.",

Recognizing concerns about crime and about discrimination or abuse of power, jurisdictions should adopt evidence-based practices, civilian oversight, data-driven monitoring, and community-led input to build trust and ensure both safer neighborhoods and equal treatment under the law.",
