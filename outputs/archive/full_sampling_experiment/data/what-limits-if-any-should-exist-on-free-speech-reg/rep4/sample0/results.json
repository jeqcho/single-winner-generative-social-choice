      "Free speech should be broadly protected as a foundation for democratic debate, but it is reasonable to limit expressions that intentionally incite violence, coordinated harassment, or credible threats against individuals or groups; such narrow, clearly defined restrictions protect safety without silencing legitimate criticism. At the same time, civic education and counter-speech should be promoted to challenge hateful ideas in the public sphere, ensuring that restrictions are applied transparently, proportionately, and subject to independent oversight so differing values and minority rights are respected.",
      "Free speech is a fundamental value that should be broadly protected, but it is reasonable to limit expressions that intentionally incite violence, harassment, or discrimination against identifiable groups; such narrowly tailored restrictions protect public safety and equal dignity without silencing legitimate debate. At the same time, laws and policies should preserve robust, nonviolent discussion, provide clear definitions to avoid arbitrary enforcement, and prioritize education and counter-speech as primary responses to hateful ideas.",
