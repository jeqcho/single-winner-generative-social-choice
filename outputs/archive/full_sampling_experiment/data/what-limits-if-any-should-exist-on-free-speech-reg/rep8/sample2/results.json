      "Free speech should be broadly protected as a cornerstone of democratic debate, while narrowly limited only where speech directly and intentionally incites imminent violence, constitutes targeted harassment or credible threats, or knowingly spreads harmful falsehoods that cause imminent, serious harm. This approach recognizes the value of open expression and the need to protect vulnerable communities, balancing civil liberties with responsibilities to prevent real-world harm by relying on clear legal standards and due process rather than broad or vague bans.",
      "Free speech should be broadly protected to foster open debate and protect dissenting views, but it must not include direct, targeted threats, credible calls to violence, or speech that intentionally organizes or incites imminent harm against vulnerable groups. Recognizing concerns about overreach and censorship, limits should be narrowly defined, applied transparently, and subject to clear legal standards and independent review so that legitimate criticism and unpopular ideas remain permissible while preventing speech that poses a real, demonstrable risk to others' safety and equal participation in society.",
      "Free speech is a fundamental right that should be broadly protected, yet it is reasonable to limit expression that intentionally incites imminent violence, harassment, or clear and targeted demeaning of vulnerable groups where harm is likely to occur. At the same time, restrictions should be narrowly defined, proportionate, and subject to transparent legal standards and safeguards to avoid suppressing legitimate debate, satire, or criticism; public policy and education should complement legal limits to reduce hate and strengthen social cohesion.",
      "Free speech should be broadly protected as essential to democratic debate, but reasonable limits are justified where expression directly and intentionally incites imminent violence or involves targeted threats, harassment, or coordinated dehumanization that foreseeably leads to harm. At the same time, responses to non\u2011violent hateful expression should prioritize counter-speech, education, and protections for vulnerable communities rather than broad censorship, balancing individual liberty with public safety and dignity.",
      "Free speech is a foundational right that should be broadly protected, but it is reasonable to limit expressions that intentionally incite violence, direct threats, or targeted harassment that cause imminent harm; meanwhile, non-violent expressions of unpopular or offensive ideas should generally be countered with more speech, education, and community norms rather than legal punishment. This approach respects the need to protect vulnerable people from real danger while preserving open debate and allowing societies to address offensive views through dialogue, context-sensitive policies, and clear, narrowly drawn legal standards against harm."
