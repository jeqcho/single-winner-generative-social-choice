I think the law should clearly restrict hate speech that directly incites harm, harassment, or discrimination, while still protecting people\u2019s right to express unpopular or offensive opinions. The focus should be on preventing concrete damage to people\u2019s safety and dignity, not on policing every hurt feeling.",
