      "Free speech is a fundamental right that should be broadly protected, but it is not absolute; narrowly tailored limits are justified where speech directly incites imminent violence, constitutes targeted harassment or credible threats, or intentionally spreads demonstrably false claims that cause immediate, significant harm. At the same time, restrictions should be clearly defined, proportionate, and subject to transparent oversight to avoid chilling legitimate debate and to protect minority voices, while promoting education, counterspeech, and community standards as complementary tools to address harmful expression.",
      "Free speech is a fundamental right that should be broadly protected, but it is reasonable to limit expressions that intentionally incite violence, direct harassment, or targeted dehumanization of identifiable groups; these narrow, well-defined restrictions protect public safety and the rights of others without silencing legitimate debate. At the same time, laws and policies should be precise, proportionate, and subject to due process, while educational and community efforts should promote respectful dialogue and counter harmful ideas through transparency and rebuttal rather than overly broad censorship.",
      "Free speech should be broadly protected to foster open dialogue and the exchange of ideas, but it should not extend to credible, targeted threats or deliberate incitement of imminent violence or unlawful acts against individuals or protected groups. Reasonable limits \u2014 narrowly tailored, established by clear legal standards, and accompanied by robust counter-speech, education, and support for affected communities \u2014 can balance the values of expression and public safety while respecting plural viewpoints.",
      "Free speech is fundamental, but it is not absolute: protections should generally extend to robust debate and unpopular ideas while prohibiting targeted, intentional incitement of violence, direct threats, and coordinated harassment that deprive others of safety and equal participation. Reasonable limits should be narrowly defined, transparent, and subject to independent oversight to prevent misuse, while education and counter-speech should be prioritized to address prejudice and build social resilience.",
      "Free speech should be broadly protected as essential to democratic discourse, but it should not be a shield for targeted, intentional harm; narrowly tailored limits on speech that directly incites violence, harassment, or credible threats against identifiable individuals or groups are justified to protect safety and equal participation. At the same time, policies and norms should preserve robust debate and artistic expression, rely on clear legal standards rather than vague bans, and prioritize education, counter-speech, and restorative measures to address prejudiced views without unduly silencing dissenting opinions."
