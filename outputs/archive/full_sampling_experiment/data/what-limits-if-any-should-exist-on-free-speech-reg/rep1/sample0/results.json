At the same time, laws and policies should avoid vague or overly broad restrictions that could chill dissent, and should be coupled with non\u2011legal responses\u2014education, counter-speech, and support for affected communities\u2014to address harmful ideas while preserving robust public discourse.",
      "Free speech is a fundamental right that should be protected, but it is not absolute; narrowly tailored limits are appropriate where speech directly and intentionally incites violence, credible threats, or targeted harassment that deprives others of their safety and equal participation. At the same time, laws and policies should avoid broadly censoring unpopular or offensive ideas, favoring transparent, proportionate measures and noncriminal responses (education, counterspeech, platform moderation) to address harm while preserving robust public debate.",
      "Free speech is a fundamental right that should be broadly protected, but it is reasonable to limit expressions that intentionally and directly incite violence, credible threats, or targeted harassment that foreseeably harms individuals or vulnerable groups. At the same time, laws and policies should guard against vague or overly broad restrictions that stifle legitimate debate, dissent, or reporting; instead, restrictions should be narrowly defined, proportionate, and subject to transparent oversight to balance free expression with protection from real, demonstrable harm.",
      "Free speech should be broadly protected to preserve open debate and the exchange of ideas, but reasonable limits are justified where speech directly and intentionally incites violence, harassment, or credible threats to individuals or protected groups. At the same time, responses to offensive or hateful expression should prioritize noncriminal remedies\u2014such as counter-speech, education, and restorative measures\u2014while ensuring any legal restrictions are narrowly defined, transparent, and subject to due process to avoid abuse and protect minority viewpoints.",
      "Free speech should be vigorously protected as a foundation for democratic debate, while reasonable limits may be applied to narrowly defined, direct harms such as credible threats, targeted incitement to violence, or deliberate harassment that silences vulnerable groups. At the same time, restrictions should be precise, legally justified, and subject to transparent oversight to avoid suppressing legitimate dissent, academic inquiry, or honest disagreement about controversial ideas. By focusing limits on clear, demonstrable harm rather than offensive or unpopular speech, societies can uphold both open expression and the safety and dignity of those at risk."
