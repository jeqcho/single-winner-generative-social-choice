Recognizing legitimate concerns about bias, inefficiency, or secrecy, institutions should adopt independent oversight, clear performance metrics, and accessible channels for feedback and redress, balancing expertise with greater public participation to rebuild confidence across diverse communities.",

This approach balances calls for oversight and reform with the need for stable governance by inviting public input, enforcing clear ethical standards, and regularly reporting outcomes so citizens can judge performance and hold institutions responsible.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to transparent decision-making, consistent accountability, and accessible communication that explains both goals and trade-offs. While acknowledging that people value different balances of efficiency, oversight, and individual liberty, institutions can build broad support by demonstrating integrity through independent oversight, regular public reporting, and meaningful avenues for citizen input."
