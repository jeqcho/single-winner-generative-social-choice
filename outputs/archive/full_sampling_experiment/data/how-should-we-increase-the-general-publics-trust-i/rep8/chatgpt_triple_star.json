    "To rebuild public trust in institutions, we should increase transparency, strengthen accountability, and ensure meaningful public participation in decision-making so that actions and outcomes are visible and responsive to citizens\u2019 needs. This approach balances the need for effective, expert-led governance with safeguards\u2014such as independent oversight, clear performance metrics, and accessible channels for feedback\u2014that address concerns about bias, secrecy, or unresponsiveness across the political spectrum.",

    "To increase public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to transparent decision-making, consistent accountability, and meaningful community engagement so that policies are both understandable and responsive to people\u2019s needs. Recognizing legitimate concerns about bias, inefficiency, or secrecy, institutions should adopt independent oversight, clear performance metrics, and accessible channels for feedback and redress, balancing expertise with greater public participation to rebuild confidence across diverse communities.",
    "To increase public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to transparent decision-making, consistent accountability, and accessible communication while protecting institutions\u2019 ability to act effectively. This approach balances calls for oversight and reform with the need for stable governance by inviting public input, enforcing clear ethical standards, and regularly reporting outcomes so citizens can judge performance and hold institutions responsible.",
    "To increase public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to transparent decision-making, consistent accountability, and accessible communication that explains both goals and trade-offs. While acknowledging that people value different balances of efficiency, oversight, and individual liberty, institutions can build broad support by demonstrating integrity through independent oversight, regular public reporting, and meaningful avenues for citizen input."
