By committing to clear, content-neutral rules for events and dialogue, promoting media literacy and conflict-resolution resources, and ensuring fair, transparent processes for addressing violations, campuses can both safeguard free speech and foster an inclusive learning environment where ideas are contested respectfully.",

By combining strong commitments to open inquiry with defined boundaries that prevent targeted intimidation, campuses can uphold academic freedom and mutual respect.",
