By committing to open dialogue, transparent procedures for addressing conflicts, and educational efforts that teach debate and critical thinking, campuses can foster both liberty of thought and community wellbeing.",

      "Universities should protect robust free expression while also fostering respectful, inclusive learning environments: free speech must be defended so ideas can be challenged and debated, but institutions should set clear, content-neutral rules to prevent harassment and ensure safety. By combining strong procedural protections for speech with proactive education, dialogue, and support for marginalized students, campuses can uphold academic freedom while promoting constructive engagement and mutual respect.",
