    "University campuses should protect robust free expression while also ensuring a safe, inclusive learning environment: institutions can uphold the principle that speech should not be suppressed merely for being controversial, yet set and fairly enforced conduct standards against harassment, threats, and disruption. By promoting open dialogue, supporting diverse viewpoints, and investing in education on civil discourse and conflict resolution, campuses can balance academic freedom with the dignity and wellbeing of their community members.",
    "Universities should protect robust free expression while also ensuring campuses are safe and inclusive for all students; this means defending the right to share controversial ideas but pairing that protection with clear policies against harassment and bias that silence others. By fostering open debate, providing contextual education and forums for civil discourse, and enforcing narrow, content-neutral rules to prevent threats or targeted intimidation, campuses can uphold free speech and mutual respect simultaneously.",
    "University campuses should protect the free exchange of ideas while also maintaining a safe, respectful environment for all students; this means upholding robust free-speech principles but pairing them with clear conduct rules and educational programs that promote civil discourse. By committing to neutral enforcement of policies, transparent procedures for addressing harms, and resources that support both expression and inclusion, campuses can foster vigorous debate without tolerating harassment or intimidation.",
    "Universities should protect robust free expression as essential to learning while also upholding policies that prevent harassment and threats so all students can participate safely. By committing to clear, narrowly tailored rules, transparent due process, and open forums for dialogue, campuses can balance the need for challenging ideas with respect for individual dignity and academic integrity.",
    "Universities should protect robust free expression as essential to learning while also maintaining policies and practices that safeguard safety, inclusion, and the ability to engage in constructive discourse. This means upholding broad speech rights, ensuring neutral and transparent event procedures, and providing resources for respectful dialogue and support for communities affected by harmful speech."
