      "The government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, quality basic healthcare by setting and enforcing standards, subsidizing care for those who cannot afford it, and supporting public health infrastructure, while preserving choices for private providers and insurers to foster innovation and competition. This balanced approach recognizes the shared interest in broad coverage and health outcomes, respects concerns about efficiency and personal freedom, and focuses on practical mechanisms\u2014such as income-based subsidies, preventive care investments, and clear regulatory safeguards\u2014to make universal access sustainable and effective.",
      "While people differ on whether healthcare should be fully government-run or market-driven, the government should ensure that every person has access to essential, affordable healthcare through a mix of public provision, targeted subsidies, and regulatory safeguards. By guaranteeing a basic standard of care, protecting against catastrophic costs, and allowing private options to innovate and expand choice, this balanced approach respects individual freedom while promoting equity and public health.",
      "The government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, quality basic healthcare by setting minimum standards, subsidizing coverage for those who cannot afford it, and regulating providers to protect safety and fairness, while preserving room for private innovation and choice. This approach acknowledges concerns about cost and government overreach by focusing public resources on essential care and protections, yet allows private options and market-driven improvements for additional services.",
      "Government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare services while preserving pathways for private innovation and choice. By guaranteeing a core set of essential benefits, strengthening public health infrastructure, and partnering with private providers and insurers, policymakers can protect vulnerable populations, control costs, and encourage competition and innovation to improve care.",
      "While people disagree on the extent of government involvement in healthcare, most can agree the public sector should ensure everyone has access to affordable, high-quality basic care and protections against catastrophic costs. The government can achieve this through a mix of policies\u2014such as targeted public coverage for the vulnerable, standardized consumer protections, incentives for cost control and innovation, and support for a competitive private sector\u2014so that access, quality, and fiscal responsibility are balanced."
