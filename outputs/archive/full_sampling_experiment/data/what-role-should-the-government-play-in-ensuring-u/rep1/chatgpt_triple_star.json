    "The government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare by setting minimum standards, subsidizing care for those who cannot afford it, and regulating the market to prevent abusive practices, while preserving room for private innovation and choice. This balances the shared goal of universal coverage and public health protection with respect for individual preferences and the efficiencies that competition and private providers can offer.",
    "While recognizing differing views on individual choice and fiscal responsibility, the government should ensure a baseline of accessible, affordable, and quality healthcare for all\u2014targeting coverage for the most vulnerable and removing barriers to essential services\u2014while allowing for a mix of public and private delivery options. This approach balances personal flexibility and innovation with shared responsibility, using clear standards, targeted subsidies, and accountability measures to contain costs and protect health outcomes.",
    "The government should ensure that all residents have access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare\u2014by setting standards, providing targeted public funding for those who cannot afford coverage, and regulating markets to control costs and protect patients\u2014while supporting a pluralistic system that preserves choice through private insurers and providers. This approach recognizes both the need for a safety net and individual flexibility, balancing public responsibility for universal access with incentives for innovation and efficiency from the private sector.",
    "While people differ on the best path to universal healthcare, the government should ensure baseline access to essential, affordable care while preserving room for private innovation and choice. By guaranteeing core preventive and emergency services, subsidizing care for those who cannot afford it, and setting standards for quality and transparency, government action can protect vulnerable populations and reduce cost-shifting without eliminating competitive options that drive efficiency and innovation.",
    "Government should ensure that every person can access affordable, high-quality basic healthcare while preserving choices and innovation in the health sector; this can be achieved through a mix of public coverage for essential services, targeted subsidies or safety nets for those unable to pay, and regulatory measures that promote competition, transparency, and cost control. By combining public responsibility for universal access with incentives for private involvement and individual choice, policymakers can respect fiscal realities and diverse values while reducing gaps in care and improving population health."
