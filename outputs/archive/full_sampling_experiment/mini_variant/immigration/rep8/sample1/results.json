      "Immigration policy should balance a secure, orderly system with a fair, humane pathway to citizenship that recognizes both the law and the dignity of migrants. Policies can combine effective border and enforcement measures with clear, attainable requirements for residency and naturalization, opportunities for family unity and labor needs, and protections for refugees and long-standing community members. This approach respects rule of law and national interests while acknowledging diverse moral views and the economic and social contributions of immigrants, seeking practical compromises that uphold security, compassion, and shared responsibility.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national sovereignty and security with humane treatment and opportunity, creating a regulated, transparent path to citizenship that upholds the rule of law while recognizing economic needs and family unity. Such a framework should combine secure borders and effective enforcement with clear, accessible legal pathways, fair adjudication, and avenues for integration\u2014ensuring newcomers contribute to and are protected by the social and civic compact. ",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with a humane, pragmatic path to legal status for long-term residents and contributors, prioritizing family unity, economic needs, and public safety. Recognizing concerns about fairness and resource limits, the system should be transparent, enforceable, and provide clear, attainable criteria for citizenship that include background checks, taxes or fees, and requirements that encourage civic integration and contribution.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with fair, humane pathways for people who contribute to our communities and economy; this means enforcing orderly entry while streamlining legal channels, protecting due process, and prioritizing family unity and labor needs. Recognizing concerns about security and fiscal impact alongside the value of immigrants\u2019 skills and humanitarian obligations, a practical path to citizenship should combine clear eligibility criteria, background checks, and requirements that encourage integration (work, taxes, language) with opportunities for those with long-standing ties or compelling humanitarian claims to earn permanent status.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and economic needs with a humane respect for human dignity by enforcing clear, fair rules that prioritize public safety while creating realistic pathways for hardworking, law-abiding immigrants to contribute and integrate. A bipartisan approach can recognize the need for secure borders and efficient enforcement alongside streamlined legal channels, family reunification, and earned paths to citizenship that include background checks, taxes, and probationary requirements\u2014ensuring accountability while enabling integration and economic contribution.
