      "Immigration policy should balance national security and the rule of law with compassion and economic reality, creating orderly processes that manage borders while enabling legal pathways for work, family reunification, and refuge. Recognizing valid concerns about sovereignty and fairness as well as the human and economic contributions of immigrants, a consensus approach would pair enforceable entry rules and reasonable enforcement with clear, attainable pathways to citizenship for those who meet established criteria and contribute positively to society.",

By combining reliable legal channels, reasonable enforcement, and targeted integration supports like language and job training, policymakers can honor humanitarian obligations, uphold the rule of law, and adapt to labor and demographic needs, recognizing that reasonable compromise is required to respect both compassionate and sovereignty-based concerns.",
