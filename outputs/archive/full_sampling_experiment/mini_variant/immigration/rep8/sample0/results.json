Recognizing concerns about borders and rule of law as well as the value of immigrants\u2019 labor and families, policies should prioritize orderly, efficient processing, targeted enforcement against serious wrongdoing, and accessible opportunities for integration through work, language, and civic education. This approach seeks to protect public safety and uphold legal standards while honoring humanitarian obligations and strengthening communities.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and economic needs with a fair, humane approach that recognizes immigrants' contributions and dignity; practical reforms can secure borders, enforce laws, and streamline legal pathways to meet labor demands while preventing exploitation. A common-sense path to citizenship should include background checks, requirements that demonstrate commitment to civic values and integration, and a realistic, time-bound process with opportunities for those already contributing to communities to regularize their status. This approach respects rule of law and address concerns about uncontrolled migration while offering a compassionate, orderly route for immigrants to fully participate in society.",

Recognizing concerns about sovereignty and resource strain as well as the economic, cultural, and moral benefits of immigration, policymakers should pursue pragmatic reforms\u2014streamlined legal channels, clear enforcement priorities, and targeted support for integration\u2014that uphold national interests and human dignity."
