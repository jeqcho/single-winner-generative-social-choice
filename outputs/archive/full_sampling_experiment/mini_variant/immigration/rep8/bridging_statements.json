    "statement": "At 50, raised in Ohio with Irish roots and a career coordinating logistics in tech, I believe immigration policy should be practical, humane, and efficiently run\u2014protecting our communities while giving hardworking people a clear, earned path to belong. Having listened to many views, I think we can bridge security and compassion by enforcing orderly borders and background checks while streamlining legal pathways, prioritizing family unity, economic need, and opportunities for long-term contributors to fully integrate.",
    "original_statement": "Immigration policy should balance compassion with practicality, providing a clear, accessible path to citizenship for people who work hard, follow the law, and contribute to our communities and economy. As someone who works in a globally connected tech field, I see firsthand how immigrants bring vital skills and innovation, and our laws should reflect that reality. We also need due process, humane enforcement, and protections that keep families together while respecting security concerns. Ultimately, our approach should reflect American values of fairness, opportunity, and human dignity."

    "original_statement": "As a Black Latina New Yorker who believes deeply in equality and social justice, I think immigration policy should be humane, fair, and focused on keeping families together and protecting people from violence and poverty. There should be a clear, affordable, and realistic path to citizenship for people who work hard, pay taxes, and contribute to our communities, including in essential jobs like hospitals. We need strong protections against exploitation and discrimination, especially for undocumented workers who keep our economy running but live in fear. A just system should treat immigrants with dignity, recognizing that this country has always been built by people coming here for a better life."
