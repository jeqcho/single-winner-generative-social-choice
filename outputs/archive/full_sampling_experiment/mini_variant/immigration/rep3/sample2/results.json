      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and orderly procedures with compassion and respect for human dignity, creating a clear, fair path to citizenship that rewards contribution while protecting national security and economic stability. Recognizing concerns about borders and labor markets as well as the moral imperative to reunite families and offer refuge, policies should be transparent, enforceable, and designed to integrate newcomers through meaningful language, job training, and civic education. This approach honors both community cohesion and the benefits of immigrants\u2019 skills and ambition, while allowing for regular review and adjustments based on economic needs and public safety data.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and national security with compassion and respect for human dignity by creating transparent, orderly pathways for legal entry and a fair, achievable path to citizenship for long-term residents. Policies should secure borders and enforce reasonable standards while expanding legal avenues for work, family reunification, and asylum, paired with clear requirements and support for integration such as language and civics programs. This approach recognizes legitimate concerns about sovereignty and economic impact while honoring humanitarian obligations and the contributions immigrants make to communities and the economy.",
      "Immigration policy should balance a sovereign nation\u2019s right to control its borders with a humane, orderly system that recognizes the economic contributions and dignity of immigrants; this means enforcing clear, fair rules while expanding legal pathways and support for integration. We can respect concerns about security and rule of law by investing in effective enforcement and vetting, while also offering a transparent, merit- and family-based path to citizenship that includes language and civic education to promote social cohesion and shared responsibility.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and economic needs with compassion and respect for human dignity, creating a fair, orderly system that welcomes those who contribute while protecting borders and public resources. A pragmatic path to citizenship should include clear eligibility criteria, requirements that demonstrate integration and ability to support oneself, and avenues to address humanitarian cases\u2014paired with efficient processes and accountability measures to uphold the rule of law. This approach acknowledges concerns about sovereignty and public order while recognizing the economic, cultural, and moral benefits of immigration and offering a realistic, humane route for long-term residents to become full members of society.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and the rule of law with compassion and practical pathways for people who contribute to our communities, ensuring borders are orderly while treating migrants with dignity. A workable path to citizenship ought to combine clear, attainable requirements\u2014such as background checks, demonstrated employment or community ties, and contribution to civic obligations\u2014with fair processing timelines and safeguards for families and vulnerable individuals, reflecting both the need for orderly systems and the country\u2019s humanitarian values."
