I\u2019ve listened to many perspectives\u2014from calls for strict borders to pleas for compassion\u2014and I think we can bridge them with a clear, efficient path to citizenship that requires work, respect for our laws and language, and protections for families and the vulnerable.",
    "original_statement": "As someone who believes strongly in individual liberty and limited government, I think immigration policy should prioritize secure borders, clear and consistently enforced rules, and a transparent, merit-based legal process. The path to citizenship should be straightforward, demanding respect for the Constitution, basic civic knowledge, and a clean record, while still offering fair opportunities for people who want to work hard, contribute, and integrate into our communities. From my experience in the military, I value both national security and the idea that America is strengthened by those who choose it and commit to it."

    "original_statement": "As a public school teacher and the granddaughter of Spanish immigrants, I believe our immigration policy and path to citizenship should be humane, fair, and rooted in the reality that immigrants strengthen our communities and classrooms.
