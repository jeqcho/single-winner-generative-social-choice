Recognizing concerns about border control and rule of law alongside humanitarian obligations and the economic benefits of immigration, reforms should be pragmatic, evidence-based, and include clear criteria, timely processing, and opportunities for integration such as language, education, and work authorization.

      "Immigration policy should balance national security and economic needs with humanitarian responsibility by enforcing fair, transparent rules that prioritize border integrity, workplace verification, and expedited processing for low-risk applicants while providing clear, attainable pathways to citizenship for those who contribute to their communities. Recognizing concerns about rule of law and cultural cohesion as well as the compassion for families and refugees, the system should include robust legal channels, targeted enforcement against criminal activity, and programs that support integration, language acquisition, and workforce participation. This pragmatic approach seeks to uphold sovereignty and public safety while honoring commitments to human dignity and the economic realities of a globalized labor market."
