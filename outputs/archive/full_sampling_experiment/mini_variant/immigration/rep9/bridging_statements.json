I\u2019ve heard many grown\u2011ups say we should be fair and keep everyone safe, so maybe we can agree on clear, kind rules that help hardworking families become part of our neighborhood while making sure our communities stay safe and strong.",

Grown\u2011ups should make rules that keep everyone safe, but also help families stay together and give kids a chance to learn, play, and become part of the place they live."

    "original_statement": "I think people who want to live here should be kind and follow the rules, just like we have rules in my house and at school. My parents say America is a place where families can find safety and a better life, so we should help good people who need it, but make sure we know who they are and that they respect our laws. My church teaches that we should care about others, especially people who are struggling, so I think the path to becoming a citizen should be fair and not too scary or confusing for families."

I\u2019ve listened to many perspectives\u2014concerns about security and the rule of law as well as calls for dignity and a realistic path to citizenship\u2014and I think common ground is a fair, transparent process that rewards contribution, requires accountability (like background checks and civic learning), and invests in integration so newcomers and longtime residents can thrive together.",

A just path to citizenship should reward those who contribute to their communities, follow the law, and integrate culturally and linguistically, without tearing families apart or trapping people in decades-long limbo."
