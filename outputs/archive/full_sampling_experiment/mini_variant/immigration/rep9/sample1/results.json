Policies ought to combine efficient legal channels, clear enforcement priorities, and practical pathways for long-term residents to earn status\u2014while addressing labor needs, family unity, and integration supports such as language and civic education.

      "Immigration policy should balance the nation\u2019s economic and security needs with a commitment to human dignity by enforcing orderly, fair borders while creating realistic pathways to citizenship for long-term residents and contributors. Policies should combine effective border management and lawful entry systems with clear, humane procedures for family reunification, refugee protection, and skills-based admission, paired with accountability measures and support for integration such as language and employment services. This approach acknowledges concerns about sovereignty and rule of law while recognizing the social and economic benefits of welcoming immigrants and offering a credible route to full membership for those who meet established requirements.",
