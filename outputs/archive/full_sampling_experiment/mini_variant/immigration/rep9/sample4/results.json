      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and border security with humane treatment and realistic opportunities for integration, recognizing both a nation's right to control entry and immigrants' contributions to society. Policies should streamline lawful pathways, enforce fair and efficient adjudication, and provide conditional routes to citizenship for those who meet security, economic, and community-integration criteria, while offering targeted protections for refugees and vulnerable individuals. By combining orderly processes, enforcement of standards, and support for inclusion, this approach respects diverse concerns about sovereignty, fairness, and shared prosperity.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and rule of law with compassion and recognition of immigrants\u2019 contributions, creating a fair, efficient path to citizenship for those who meet clear requirements and demonstrate commitment to integration. By combining robust border management and vetting with accessible legal channels, labor protections, and targeted pathways for longtime residents, policymakers can respect diverse concerns while upholding shared values of opportunity, family unity, and economic vitality.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with a humane, economically sensible path to legal status for those already contributing to our communities; this approach recognizes the need to control entry while offering orderly, merit- and family-based avenues that reflect national interests. By combining clear enforcement priorities, streamlined legal processes, and realistic pathways to citizenship tied to background checks, taxes, and integration requirements, we can uphold sovereignty, protect public safety, and honor our values of opportunity and family unity.",
      "Immigration policy should balance secure, orderly borders and enforcement with a fair, humane pathway to legal status that recognizes economic needs, family unity, and human rights. While respecting the rule of law and the need to manage flows, the approach should create realistic, merit- and need-based legal channels, clear due-process protections, and targeted pathways to citizenship for long-standing residents and essential workers, alongside practical measures to integrate newcomers and protect vulnerable migrants.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with a fair, humane process that recognizes immigrants' economic contributions and family ties; practical pathways to citizenship should be merit- and need-based while allowing for humanitarian relief and family reunification. By combining sensible enforcement, transparent legal pathways, and investments in integration (language, job training, and civic education), policymakers can uphold national interests and values while respecting human dignity and strengthening communities."
