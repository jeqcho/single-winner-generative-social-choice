This approach acknowledges concerns about security and rule of law while affirming shared values of opportunity and compassion, and it calls for practical reforms\u2014clear eligibility criteria, timely adjudication, and robust integration supports\u2014that build public confidence and respect diverse viewpoints.",

Such a framework acknowledges legitimate concerns about borders and workplace protections, while also recognizing the economic and social benefits of immigrants and the moral imperative to treat families and vulnerable people humanely.",
