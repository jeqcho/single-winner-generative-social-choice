Recognizing concerns about jobs, safety, and cultural cohesion alongside the contributions immigrants bring, a fair path to citizenship should include clear eligibility criteria, requirements for language and civic knowledge, background checks, and opportunities for integration and mobility that reflect both societal needs and individual dignity.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and border security with a fair, humane pathway to legal status that recognizes immigrants\u2019 contributions and family unity. By combining enforceable entry and employment rules with attainable, merit- and need-sensitive routes to citizenship, streamlined processing, and protections for vulnerable people, policymakers can uphold public safety and economic interests while honoring humanitarian commitments and shared community values.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with a humane, practical pathway to citizenship that recognizes immigrants\u2019 contributions and upholds national values; this means enforcing fair, transparent procedures while creating realistic routes for long-term residents, families, and high-demand workers to fully integrate. Policies should address public concerns about safety and economic impact through effective enforcement and verification, while also investing in fair processing, integration services, and reasonable timelines that promote social cohesion and economic opportunity for all.",
      "Immigration policy should balance a sovereign nation\u2019s right to control its borders with a commitment to humane treatment and opportunity for newcomers, by enforcing clear, fair rules that prioritize security, economic needs, and family unity. A practical path to citizenship should combine accountability\u2014through background checks, penalties for serious violations, and demonstrated civic and economic integration\u2014with accessible, timely processes that recognize immigrants\u2019 contributions and preserve core values of fairness and the rule of law.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with a humane, efficient pathway to citizenship for those who contribute to society and follow established requirements; this means clear, enforceable rules, fair processing, and sensible accommodations for refugees and longtime residents. Recognizing concerns about economic impacts and national security, policymakers can build consensus by prioritizing skill- and family-based admissions, rigorous vetting, and integration support such as language and job training so newcomers can fully participate and strengthen the community."
