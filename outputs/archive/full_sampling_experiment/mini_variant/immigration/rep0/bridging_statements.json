    "statement": "I\u2019m a 17-year-old Black girl from Wisconsin juggling school, work as a cashier, and raising kids at home, and I believe immigration policy should be fair, practical, and centered on keeping families together while keeping communities safe. I\u2019ve heard lots of views\u2014some want stricter enforcement, others want compassion and easier paths\u2014but we can agree on clear rules, humane treatment, and a realistic path to citizenship for people who work, pay taxes, and contribute to our neighborhoods.",
    "original_statement": "I think immigration policy should balance being fair and humane with keeping the country safe and stable. People who work hard, follow the laws, and contribute to their communities should have a clear, realistic path to citizenship, not be stuck in limbo for years. Families shouldn\u2019t be torn apart, and kids who grow up here, go to school here, and call this place home should have a real chance to belong. At the same time, the government should do proper background checks and make sure the system isn\u2019t abused so people don\u2019t feel like the rules don\u2019t matter."

I hear people across the spectrum calling for secure, orderly systems and for fair, attainable paths to citizenship for those who work, pay taxes, and integrate; sensible policy should marry firm, transparent enforcement with humane, practical routes to full membership so communities and the rule of law both thrive.",
    "original_statement": "As a Catholic and a conservative, I believe immigration policy should balance compassion with respect for the rule of law and the stability of our communities. We should welcome those who come legally, work hard, and embrace our language, civic traditions, and responsibilities, while firmly enforcing our borders and immigration laws. A fair, orderly path to citizenship ought to prioritize security checks, economic self-sufficiency, and genuine commitment to American values, not political advantage."
