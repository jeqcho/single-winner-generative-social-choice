Recognizing legitimate concerns about economic and security impacts, a fair pathway should include clear eligibility criteria, background checks, reasonable timelines, and expectations for integration such as language and civics preparation, while offering avenues for long-term residents and DREAMers to earn full status through demonstrated contribution and adherence to the law.",

By combining reasonable enforcement, clear legal avenues for work and residency, and targeted programs for integration and skills development, policymakers can protect national interests while honoring economic needs and human dignity. This approach acknowledges concerns about sovereignty and fairness while creating predictable, attainable routes that reward compliance and facilitate assimilation.",

By combining secure, orderly entry and enforcement with clear, attainable requirements for legal status \u2014 including background checks, work requirements, and opportunities for family unity and integration \u2014 policymakers can address concerns about fairness, economic needs, and human dignity while upholding national interests.",
      "Immigration policy should balance a humane commitment to family unity and economic opportunity with practical measures that secure borders and ensure orderly, lawful entry; this means creating fair, transparent pathways to citizenship that include background checks, language and civic integration supports, and reasonable timelines for adjudication. While people differ on the scale and immediacy of reforms, most can agree on protecting public safety, honoring existing legal processes, valuing immigrants\u2019 contributions, and investing in integration programs that help new citizens fully participate in civic and economic life.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the country's economic and security needs with a commitment to human dignity by creating orderly, enforceable pathways that prioritize skilled and family reunification while addressing humanitarian obligations. A fair pathway to citizenship should include clear eligibility criteria, accountability measures such as background checks and tax compliance, and reasonable, timely processes that integrate immigrants into communities and the workforce. This approach respects rule of law and border integrity while recognizing the economic and social contributions of newcomers and offering a humane, practical route for those already contributing to society."
