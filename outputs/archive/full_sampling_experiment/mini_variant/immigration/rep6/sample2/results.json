By combining realistic pathways to citizenship for long-term residents and DREAMers, streamlined legal channels for labor and family reunification, and robust enforcement against exploitation and fraud, we can respect rule of law, uphold humanitarian values, and strengthen social and economic cohesion.",
      "Immigration policy and the path to citizenship should balance national security and economic needs with humane treatment and respect for human rights, creating clear, fair, and efficient processes that uphold the rule of law. Recognizing concerns about borders and labor markets as well as the humanitarian and family-reunification imperatives, policy should combine orderly admission and enforcement with realistic pathways to legal status for longtime residents and high-demand workers, accompanied by integration supports and accountability measures.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with compassion and practical pathways for people who contribute to our communities and economy. While some emphasize enforcement and orderly processes and others prioritize humanitarian relief and inclusion, we can agree on clear, fair rules that prioritize public safety, streamline legal channels, and create accountable, merit- and need-based paths to permanent residency and citizenship. Such a framework should include humane treatment, support for integration (language, work authorization, and social services), and regular review to adapt to economic and security needs. This approach respects differing priorities while promoting stability, opportunity, and shared responsibility.",
      "A sustainable immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with a humane, pragmatic pathway to citizenship for long-term residents who contribute to society, emphasizing skills, family unity, and respect for due process. It should acknowledge legitimate concerns about national security and economic impacts while investing in fair, efficient legal channels, robust integration programs, and transparent enforcement so that communities, employers, and newcomers can plan and prosper together."
