    "original_statement": "As someone who believes strongly in individual liberty and limited government, I think immigration policy should prioritize secure borders, clear and consistently enforced rules, and a transparent, merit-based legal process. The path to citizenship should be straightforward, demanding respect for the Constitution, basic civic knowledge, and a clean record, while still offering fair opportunities for people who want to work hard, contribute, and integrate into our communities. From my experience in the military, I value both national security and the idea that America is strengthened by those who choose it and commit to it."
