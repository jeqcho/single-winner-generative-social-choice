      "Immigration policy should balance national security and rule of law with compassion and respect for human dignity by enforcing clear, fair rules while providing realistic, merit- and need-based pathways to citizenship. Recognizing both the contributions immigrants make to the economy and the legitimate concerns about borders and integration, the system should include effective enforcement, streamlined legal channels, opportunities for labor mobility and family reunification, and responsible routes to legalization tied to background checks, language and civics requirements, and phased access to benefits. This approach honors different viewpoints by protecting public safety and national interests while affirming shared values of opportunity and inclusion.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and national security with a humane, practical path to citizenship that recognizes immigrants\u2019 economic contributions and family ties. By combining secure, enforceable borders and clear, fair enforcement with streamlined legal channels, earned pathways for long-term residents, and targeted protections for vulnerable people, policymakers can uphold sovereignty while honoring humanitarian and economic interests. This approach acknowledges concerns about order and resource allocation while finding common ground in shared values of opportunity, responsibility, and community integration.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with compassion and opportunity, creating clear, fair pathways to work, family reunification, and citizenship for those who contribute to society. Policies should recognize legitimate concerns about safety and economic impact while streamlining legal processes, enforcing standards consistently, and investing in integration programs that uphold human dignity and promote shared prosperity.",
      "Immigration policy should balance a nation\u2019s right to secure its borders and enforce laws with a humane, pragmatic pathway to citizenship for those who contribute to society and respect civic obligations. By combining fair enforcement, streamlined legal immigration channels, workplace and humanitarian protections, and clear, attainable requirements for naturalization, policymakers can honor rule of law while recognizing family unity, economic needs, and human dignity. This approach acknowledges legitimate concerns about security and sovereignty while creating predictable, accountable routes for immigrants to fully integrate and contribute.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with a humane, efficient system that welcomes newcomers who contribute economically and socially; this means enforcing fair entry rules while expanding legal pathways, streamlining processing, and providing clear, achievable routes to citizenship for those who meet established requirements. Recognizing concerns about national security, economic impact, and community cohesion, policymakers should invest in border management, labor-aligned visas, and integration supports\u2014such as language and job training\u2014so that families and employers can plan reliably and society benefits broadly."
