      "Immigration policy should balance national security and economic needs with humane treatment and respect for human dignity, creating clear, efficient pathways to legal status and citizenship for those who contribute to the country while protecting borders and enforcing fair rules. Recognizing concerns about jobs, public resources, and rule of law, policy should include robust vetting, opportunities for skills-based and family reunification admissions, and pathways to citizenship that require demonstrated commitment to civic responsibilities and integration. By combining enforcement with predictable legal channels and support for integration, we can uphold sovereignty and community safety while honoring humanitarian obligations and fostering economic vitality.",
      "Immigration policy should balance a commitment to humane treatment and opportunity with practical measures to protect national security and economic stability; this means clear, enforceable rules for entry and employment, along with fair pathways to legal status for those who contribute to their communities and follow the law. Recognizing differences in opinion about borders and enforcement, we can find common ground by improving border management, streamlining legal immigration channels, investing in integration services (language, job training, and civic education), and providing transparent, merit- and hardship-based routes to citizenship that uphold the rule of law while honoring family unity and human dignity.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and national security with compassion and respect for human dignity by creating transparent, enforceable pathways that prioritize family unity, economic contribution, and public safety. Recognizing concerns about border control and legal integrity as well as the moral and economic arguments for welcoming newcomers, a fair system would streamline legal immigration, strengthen enforcement against exploitation and unauthorized entry, and provide clear, merit- and need-based routes to citizenship coupled with accountability and integration supports such as language and employment programs.",

      "Immigration policy should balance the nation\u2019s economic and security interests with respect for human dignity by enforcing orderly, transparent rules while creating realistic, fair pathways for long-term residents to earn citizenship. Recognizing legitimate concerns about borders and labor markets as well as the contributions of immigrants and refugee protections, policy should combine effective enforcement, streamlined legal channels for work and family reunification, and attainable, merit- and time-based naturalization options that include checks for public safety and requirements for civic integration."
