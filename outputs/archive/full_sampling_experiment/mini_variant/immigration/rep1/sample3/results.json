      "Immigration policy and the path to citizenship should balance national security and economic needs with humane treatment and respect for human dignity by enforcing orderly, predictable rules that prioritize border integrity and lawful entry while creating realistic, transparent pathways for long-term residents to gain legal status. A consensus approach recognizes legitimate concerns about public safety and job protection while also acknowledging the contributions of immigrants and the moral imperative to reunite families and provide refuge; policies should therefore combine effective enforcement, streamlined legal immigration channels, labor-driven visas, and conditional pathways to citizenship tied to background checks, tax compliance, and community contributions. ",

While some prioritize rule of law and national security and others emphasize compassion and inclusion, common ground exists in creating streamlined legal channels, robust labor and integration supports, and clear, attainable criteria for citizenship that uphold public safety and economic stability.",

Recognizing concerns about sovereignty, border control, and labor markets as well as the humanitarian and economic benefits of immigration, policymakers should pursue transparent, enforceable rules that prioritize family unity, skills-based pathways, and timely adjudication to integrate newcomers while protecting communities.",

By combining clear rules, reasonable enforcement, opportunities for earned legalization (including background checks, language and civics requirements, and pathways for family unity and refugees), and targeted investments in integration and border infrastructure, we can respect law and national interests while upholding human dignity and fostering social cohesion.",
