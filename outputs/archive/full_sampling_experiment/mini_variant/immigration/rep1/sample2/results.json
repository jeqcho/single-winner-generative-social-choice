      "Immigration policy should balance the nation's economic and security needs with a commitment to human dignity by enforcing fair, transparent rules that allow legal entry, protect borders, and provide a realistic, orderly path to citizenship for those who contribute and comply with the law. Recognizing both the value immigrants bring and concerns about rule of law and resources, policies should combine strong labor and border enforcement, streamlined legal avenues responsive to labor market needs, and clear, attainable requirements for naturalization that include background checks, language and civic knowledge, and opportunities for families to remain intact. This approach respects diverse viewpoints by upholding sovereignty and public safety while offering humane solutions that integrate newcomers as productive, accountable members of society.",

Recognizing concerns about resource stress and national sovereignty alongside the humanitarian and economic benefits of immigration, policies should streamline legal channels, enforce clear requirements, and include opportunities for family unity, skills-based admission, and conditional pathways to permanent residency tied to background checks, work, and civic participation."
