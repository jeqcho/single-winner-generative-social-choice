We need a clear, humane path to citizenship that recognizes people\u2019s contributions to our communities and economy, protects families from being torn apart, and rejects criminalizing those who are simply seeking safety and opportunity. Security and order matter, but they shouldn\u2019t be used as excuses for cruelty or discrimination, especially against people from places like the Caribbean or Latin America.

    "statement": "As a 37-year-old nursing assistant, a busy mom in a cohabiting household, and a Catholic who values privacy and personal freedom, I believe immigration policy should blend compassion for families and workers with practical, enforceable rules that protect communities and public services. Having listened to many reasonable but differing views, I support a clear, affordable path to citizenship for law-abiding people who contribute and keep families together, paired with sensible border and vetting measures that respect the rule of law and public safety.",
    "original_statement": "As someone who was born here but comes from an immigrant family, I think immigration policy should balance strong, secure borders with a fair, realistic path to citizenship for people who work hard, follow the law, and contribute to their communities. We need a process that isn\u2019t so complicated and expensive that it punishes families, especially those with kids, while still making sure background checks and public safety are taken seriously. I believe people who\u2019ve lived here for years, paid taxes, and been part of our neighborhoods\u2014like many who work in healthcare and care for our elderly\u2014deserve a chance to come out of the shadows and become citizens over time."

    "statement": "As a 33-year-old medical assistant who takes my work seriously, values family and faith, and believes in responsibility and order, I think immigration policy should balance secure, well-enforced borders with a humane, earned path to citizenship for people who work, pay taxes, and keep families together. I respect the many viewpoints that prioritize either compassion or rule of law, and I believe common ground is possible by requiring clear, fair standards\u2014like background checks, English and civic learning, and steady employment\u2014while streamlining processes so deserving long-term residents aren\u2019t left in limbo.",
    "original_statement": "I believe immigration policy should prioritize security, the rule of law, and fairness to those who follow the legal process. We should welcome immigrants who are willing to work hard, respect our laws, and contribute to our communities, but there must be strong border enforcement and no automatic path to citizenship for those who enter illegally. A reasonable path to citizenship should be orderly, involve learning English, paying taxes, and passing background checks, so that becoming an American remains a serious and respected commitment."
