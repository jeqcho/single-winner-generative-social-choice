      "Immigration policy should balance respect for national sovereignty and security with a humane, orderly pathway to citizenship that recognizes immigrants' economic contributions and family ties. Policies should combine enforceable borders and fair legal processes, including clear, attainable requirements and timelines for naturalization, while providing protections for vulnerable individuals and mechanisms to integrate newcomers through language, employment, and civic education. This approach acknowledges concerns about law and resources while affirming shared values of opportunity, responsibility, and community cohesion.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and economic needs with humanitarian responsibilities by enforcing lawful entry while providing fair, achievable pathways to citizenship for long-term residents and high-need workers. Recognizing concerns about rule of law and resource impacts, the approach should include robust border management, merit- and need-based admissions, due-process protections, and clear timelines and requirements for integration, with periodic review to adjust for changing labor markets and humanitarian crises.",
      "Immigration policy should balance a secure, orderly system with humane treatment by enforcing clear rules, protecting borders, and expediting legal pathways to work and family reunification; at the same time it should recognize economic needs and respect human dignity by offering fair, transparent routes to permanent residency and citizenship for those who meet demonstrated commitments to integration. While people differ on the pace and scale of change, common ground exists in strengthening enforcement against fraud and criminal activity, investing in timely adjudication and integration services, and creating realistic, merit- and need-based pathways that reward contribution and adherence to the law.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with humane treatment and realistic paths to citizenship for those who contribute to our communities; this means enforcing entry rules while creating transparent, fair, and timely processes for work visas, family reunification, and eventual naturalization. We can respect national sovereignty and public safety while investing in efficient administration, rigorous vetting, and integration supports\u2014such as language, job training, and civic education\u2014to ensure newcomers contribute economically and socially and that communities impacted by immigration are supported.",
      "Immigration policy and the path to citizenship should balance national security and rule of law with compassion and economic practicality by enforcing orderly, transparent rules while creating realistic, humane pathways for immigrants who contribute to society. Recognizing legitimate concerns about border control and fair labor markets, policymakers should streamline legal processes, prioritize family unity and integration through language and job training, and include accountable mechanisms to address misuse\u2014so that the system is secure, fair, and reflects both the country\u2019s values and economic needs."
