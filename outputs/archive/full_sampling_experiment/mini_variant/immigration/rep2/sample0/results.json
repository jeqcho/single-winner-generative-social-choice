Policies ought to combine effective enforcement and secure borders with clear, fair criteria for legal entry, work authorization, and a realistic, merit- and humanitarian-informed pathway to citizenship that includes opportunities for integration and contribution. By investing in efficient processing, robust vetting, and programs that support language, job training, and civic participation, the system can both uphold rule of law and harness immigrants' skills for shared prosperity.",

Recognizing concerns about border control, rule of law, and labor market impacts, policies should include robust border management, mechanisms to prioritize skilled and family reunification, and transparent, attainable requirements for legalization that reward integration, civic participation, and respect for the law.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with a humane, orderly process that recognizes economic needs and family unity; practical reforms such as clear pathways to legal status, merit- and need-based admissions, and streamlined adjudication can reduce irregular migration while protecting national interests. A mutual commitment to enforcing standards, protecting vulnerable migrants, and integrating newcomers through language, work, and civic opportunities can bridge concerns about sovereignty and community impact, yielding policies that are fair, pragmatic, and broadly supported.",
