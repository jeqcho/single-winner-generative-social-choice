A pragmatic path to citizenship should combine earned legalization\u2014through background checks, payment of fines or taxes, and demonstrated contribution to the community\u2014with clear requirements and attainable steps that preserve rule of law while recognizing family unity and humanitarian obligations.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and rule of law with humane treatment and economic opportunity, creating a fair, orderly system that welcomes newcomers who contribute while ensuring borders are managed and legal processes respected. It should include clear pathways to citizenship for those who meet rigorous requirements\u2014such as background checks, tax and civic participation, and language or employment benchmarks\u2014while providing temporary protections for vulnerable populations and streamlined legal channels to reduce irregular migration. This approach recognizes concerns about sovereignty and social cohesion alongside the moral and economic benefits of immigration, seeking pragmatic reforms that earn broad public support.",

      "Immigration policy should balance national security and the rule of law with compassion and the economic and cultural benefits newcomers bring, creating clear, fair pathways to legal status that reward work, family unity, and contribution to community. While recognizing concerns about border control and resource limits, policies should streamline legal immigration, provide orderly routes for asylum seekers, and offer pragmatic, merit- and need-based paths to citizenship that integrate newcomers through language, civic education, and opportunities for mobility."
