    "statement": "Tech companies should be able to use data to run and improve services, but they must earn trust through plain\u2011English transparency, true opt\u2011in consent for anything beyond what\u2019s necessary, and simple tools to access, delete, and limit sharing of personal information. They should minimize what they collect, secure it to high standards, and be legally accountable for misuse or preventable breaches, with extra protections for sensitive data and minors. This approach preserves innovation and choice while setting clear, enforceable guardrails so people aren\u2019t treated like products."

    "statement": "Tech companies ought to be straight with folks in plain English about what they collect, why they need it, and whether it\u2019s being shared or sold, with simple yes/no controls and an easy way to delete your data\u2014especially when it comes to kids. They should collect the minimum, lock it down with strong security, and face real consequences if they\u2019re careless or dishonest, the same way any other business would. I don\u2019t want government running the tech world, but I do want clear, enforceable rules that protect family privacy while still letting companies innovate and make an honest buck."
