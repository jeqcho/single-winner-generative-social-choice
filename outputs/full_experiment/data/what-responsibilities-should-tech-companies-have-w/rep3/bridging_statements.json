    "statement": "Tech companies should keep people\u2019s information super safe and only take what they really need, and they must tell families in simple words (in our language) what they\u2019re collecting and why. They should ask first\u2014especially for kids\u2014and let parents easily say \u201cno,\u201d see what\u2019s saved, and delete it. If a company uses or sells data to make money, there should be clear rules and real trouble for the company if they break trust or let data leak."
