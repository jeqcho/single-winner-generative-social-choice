    "statement": "I\u2019d support a practical path that moves us toward \u201cone person, one vote\u201d while respecting the country\u2019s regional balance: adopt the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact and pair it with clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, recounts, and elector binding. If full adoption stalls, states should at least end winner-take-all by allocating electors proportionally so fewer voters\u2014especially in \u201csafe\u201d states\u2014are effectively written out of the story. Either way, the goal is simple: make every ballot matter, so candidates must speak to all communities and take nationwide responsibilities like protecting our land and wildlife seriously."
