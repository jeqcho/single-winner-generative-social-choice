    "statement": "Keep the Electoral College, but reform it so outcomes track the will of voters more closely and people in \u201csafe\u201d states aren\u2019t ignored. A practical compromise is to end winner-take-all by encouraging proportional or district-based allocation nationwide, bind electors to their state\u2019s certified results, and set clear, uniform standards for transparency, security, and timely certification across states. That preserves the federal balance and protects smaller states while making every vote feel more meaningful and strengthening trust in the process."

    "statement": "Keep the Electoral College for now, but make the outcome track the people\u2019s will more closely by ending winner\u2011take\u2011all and requiring proportional (or district-based) allocation in every state, with electors bound to the certified results and clear, uniform national standards for ballot access, counting, and transparency. Pair that with ranked-choice voting within states to reduce \u201cwasted vote\u201d pressure and encourage broader coalition-building. This preserves the federal balance smaller states value while making every vote matter more equally and reducing the outsized power of a handful of swing states."
