    "statement": "A practical compromise is to make the right choice the easy default: invest in plenty of well-placed, clearly labeled trash and recycling bins (and keep them serviced), using data and simple tech to target hotspots and prevent overflow. Pair that with fair, consistent enforcement\u2014meaningful fines for repeat or blatant littering, with community service cleanup as an option\u2014so accountability matches impact. Build the long-term norm through school- and community-based education and clean-up partnerships, and require businesses that generate heavy packaging waste to help fund prevention and cleanup so the burden isn\u2019t pushed onto taxpayers and volunteers alone."
