Public art and community projects that transform once-littered corners into places of beauty can also shift behavior; people are far less likely to deface what they feel some pride and ownership in."

    "statement": "I think the best way to stop littering is to make it really easy for people to throw trash away, like having more bins and recycling cans in parks and near playgrounds. At my church they tell us to take care of God\u2019s creation, so I feel like people should have to help clean up sometimes if they litter on purpose, kind of like a consequence and a lesson. It would also help if schools and communities did fun projects or contests about keeping our neighborhoods clean so kids and adults remember not to just drop trash on the ground."
