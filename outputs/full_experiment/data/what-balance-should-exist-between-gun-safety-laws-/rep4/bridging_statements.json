    "statement": "We can honor the Second Amendment for law\u2011abiding adults while treating gun ownership like any other high\u2011risk system: clear standards, accountability, and safeguards that reduce preventable harm. A workable compromise is universal background checks, mandatory safe storage, and focused red\u2011flag procedures with strong due\u2011process protections, paired with better enforcement against trafficking and straw purchases. That approach protects responsible ownership for self\u2011defense, hunting, and sport while prioritizing the sanctity of life and the everyday safety of schools, workplaces, and communities."
