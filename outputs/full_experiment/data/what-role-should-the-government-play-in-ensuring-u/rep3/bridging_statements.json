    "statement": "Healthcare should be treated as a basic public good\u2014like clean water and safe air\u2014so the government must guarantee that every person can get preventive care, emergency treatment, essential medicines, and disability supports without fear of medical debt. To respect choice and keep things practical, a universal public plan can set a solid floor while private plans and providers remain available for additional coverage, with clear rules against denial for preexisting conditions and strong oversight to rein in prices and waste. Done right, that protects the vulnerable, supports rural and local clinics, and keeps our communities healthy enough to care for one another and the natural world we depend on."
