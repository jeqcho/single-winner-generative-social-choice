    "statement": "I\u2019m for strong free-speech rights, and I don\u2019t want the government in the business of policing \u201coffensive\u201d opinions, but there\u2019s a clear line when words become true threats, direct incitement to violence, or targeted harassment that keeps people from living and participating in public life safely. As a Catholic, I think we can protect everyone\u2019s dignity by keeping legal limits narrow and focused on concrete harm, while leaving room for tough debate and criticism. Outside those narrow cases, the better answer is firm community standards\u2014at work, in schools, and on platforms\u2014and more speech: calling out hate, teaching responsibility, and backing it up with consequences short of criminalizing ideas."

    "statement": "Free speech should stay broad and viewpoint-neutral, with the government stepping in only when words become true threats, direct incitement of imminent violence, or targeted harassment that effectively blocks someone\u2019s ability to live, work, or participate safely in public life. Outside those narrow lines, the best response to hateful ideas is strong counter-speech and community leadership\u2014especially in schools, workplaces, and online spaces\u2014through clear conduct rules and consistent enforcement rather than criminalizing unpopular opinions. That approach protects the First Amendment while still holding people accountable when speech is used as a weapon against others\u2019 safety and dignity."

    "statement": "Free speech should stay broad enough to protect unpopular viewpoints and honest debate, but it shouldn\u2019t cover true threats, targeted harassment, or direct incitement to violence\u2014especially when it undermines people\u2019s ability to learn, work, and participate safely in public life. A practical compromise is to keep legal limits narrow and behavior-based (threats, stalking, coordinated intimidation), while schools, workplaces, and platforms enforce clear, viewpoint-neutral conduct rules that prevent hostile environments and protect vulnerable groups. The long-term answer is strong education, community accountability, and counter-speech that builds dignity and inclusion without handing the government sweeping power to police opinions."
