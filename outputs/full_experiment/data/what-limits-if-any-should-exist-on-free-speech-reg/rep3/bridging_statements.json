    "statement": "Free speech should remain broad so people can argue, criticize, and dissent without fear, but it should not protect true threats, direct incitement to violence, or sustained targeted harassment that makes people unsafe because of who they are. The legal line should be narrow and clearly defined, while communities, schools, workplaces, and faith groups set strong standards that discourage dehumanizing talk and support those being targeted. Like caring for a local habitat, we protect the open commons best by stopping the most dangerous pollution of it\u2014without letting authorities police every offensive opinion."
