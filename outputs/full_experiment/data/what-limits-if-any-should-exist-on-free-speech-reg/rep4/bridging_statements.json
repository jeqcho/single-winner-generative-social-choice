But there should be clear, narrowly defined consequences when words become conduct\u2014credible threats, targeted harassment, stalking, or direct incitement to violence\u2014since that\u2019s about public safety, not hurt feelings. Outside that line, the best answer to hateful talk is firm community standards, employers and platforms setting their own rules, and steady counter-speech rooted in the dignity of every person."

    "statement": "Free speech should be protected as broadly as possible, but it shouldn\u2019t cover true threats, incitement to imminent violence, stalking, or severe, targeted harassment that effectively denies people equal access to workplaces, schools, or public life. Rather than vague \u201chate speech\u201d bans, we should enforce narrowly defined laws against threats and harassment and expect platforms and employers to set clear conduct rules, while leaving room for controversial debate and criticism of ideas and institutions. As a community, we should pair those guardrails with strong counterspeech, education, and a firm commitment to human dignity so everyone can participate without fear."
