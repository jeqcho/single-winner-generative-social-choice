    "statement": "We should set clear, achievable protections for clean air and water and steadily cut emissions, but do it in a way that keeps energy reliable and affordable and doesn\u2019t wipe out working people or small businesses. The best path is practical and market-driven: reward American innovation in cleaner power, efficiency, and resilient infrastructure, with reasonable timelines and less red tape, while investing in job training and transition support for communities tied to legacy energy. That balance protects the outdoors and natural resources I value and strengthens economic and national security at the same time."
