    "statement": "We can agree that a healthy climate, clean air and water, and protected wildlife habitat are the bedrock of any lasting economy, so environmental safeguards should set clear, science-based boundaries for growth. Within those guardrails, we should use incentives, local conservation projects, and steady investment in clean energy, efficiency, and restoration to create reliable jobs and keep household costs manageable. The transition must be fair\u2014prioritizing support, retraining, and help with energy bills for workers, small businesses, and people on fixed incomes\u2014so no community is sacrificed while we care for creation."
