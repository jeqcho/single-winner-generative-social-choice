    "statement": "Abortion laws should respect the sanctity of unborn life while keeping women safe by relying on medical evidence and protecting the doctor\u2013patient relationship, not turning personal faith into blanket criminal penalties. A workable compromise is to allow early-pregnancy access with informed consent and reasonable safeguards, and to set tighter limits later in pregnancy with clear exceptions for the mother\u2019s life and serious health risks, rape or incest, and severe fetal anomalies. At the same time, we should reduce the need for abortion by expanding access to contraception and accurate education, and by strengthening practical supports for families, adoption, and prenatal care so choosing life is a real option."
