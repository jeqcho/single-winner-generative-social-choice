    "statement": "Abortion law should protect personal liberty and privacy while acknowledging the state\u2019s legitimate interest in potential life, using clear, medically grounded rules rather than religious or partisan dictates. Guarantee safe, legal access early in pregnancy, and allow later limits that include firm exceptions for the pregnant person\u2019s life and health, rape or incest, and severe fetal anomaly, with decisions centered on the patient and clinician. Pair any legal framework with robust prevention and support\u2014comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, maternal healthcare, disability-aware services, and economic help\u2014so fewer families face crisis choices and no one is coerced by circumstance."

    "statement": "As a Catholic who leans conservative, I believe our laws should affirm the value of unborn life while also recognizing that pregnancy can involve rare, tragic medical realities where the mother\u2019s life must be protected and doctors need clear latitude to act. A workable compromise is to limit elective abortion as pregnancy progresses, paired with well-defined exceptions for life-threatening conditions and severe medical complications, and to keep decisions grounded in medical evidence and due process rather than politics. At the same time, we should invest in prevention and real support\u2014affordable contraception, sex education, prenatal and maternal care, adoption services, and practical help for low-income families\u2014so fewer women ever feel cornered into an abortion."
