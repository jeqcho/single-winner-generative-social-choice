    "statement": "Laws on abortion should treat pregnancy decisions as private healthcare choices made by the pregnant person with medical professionals, while also recognizing society\u2019s real interest in reducing unwanted pregnancies and supporting families. A workable compromise is to protect safe, legal access early in pregnancy and guarantee clear exceptions later for life/health risks, severe fetal complications, and cases like rape, with any limits written to follow medical evidence\u2014not politics. At the same time, we should invest in contraception, comprehensive sex education, and affordable healthcare and family supports so fewer people ever face this decision and no one is forced into it by finances or lack of care."

    "statement": "Our abortion laws should start from a respect for unborn human life while also facing the hard medical and moral realities families deal with, so they must include clear, workable exceptions to protect the mother\u2019s life and serious health, and handle tragic cases like rape with compassion rather than punishment. Decisions should stay as close as possible to the woman, her doctor, and her conscience, with the state setting reasonable, medically grounded limits as pregnancy advances. At the same time, we should put real resources behind prevention and support\u2014better prenatal care, adoption help, counseling, contraception, and practical assistance\u2014so fewer women feel cornered into abortion in the first place."

    "statement": "Abortion law should keep early-pregnancy decisions primarily between the pregnant person and their clinician, protected by privacy and evidence-based medical standards, while allowing carefully defined limits later in pregnancy with clear exceptions for the life and serious health of the mother, rape/incest, and severe fetal anomalies. At the same time, we should reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education and reliable contraception, and make it more realistic to carry a pregnancy to term through strong supports like prenatal care, paid leave, childcare help, and adoption resources. The goal is less politics and punishment, more compassion, medical clarity, and practical options for families."
