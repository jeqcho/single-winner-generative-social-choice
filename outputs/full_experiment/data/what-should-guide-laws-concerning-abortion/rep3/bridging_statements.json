    "statement": "Laws should keep moms safe and let families and doctors make hard choices in private, with rules that are kind and not scary. The rules should also try to protect babies as much as they can, especially later when the baby is growing big, but still help in emergencies when the mom is very sick or hurt. And grown-ups should make it easier to have a baby by helping with doctors, money, and learning about how to prevent surprise babies."

    "statement": "Abortion law should protect both the dignity of the mother and the value of unborn life by allowing early-pregnancy decisions to remain primarily between a woman, her family, and her doctor, while setting clearer limits as the pregnancy advances, with firm exceptions for medical emergencies, rape, and incest. As a society, we should pair any legal boundaries with practical support that reduces desperation\u2014affordable prenatal care, adoption support, and help for families\u2014so choosing to carry a pregnancy isn\u2019t just a moral expectation but a realistic option. Above all, the law should aim for compassion, medical clarity, and accountability without turning private crises into criminal ones."

    "statement": "Our abortion laws should start from compassion and humility: protect the health, privacy, and moral agency of the pregnant person, while also recognizing the serious value many place on unborn life and avoiding one-size-fits-all bans that endanger women. I can live with legal early-pregnancy access as essential healthcare, paired with clear, medically grounded safeguards later in pregnancy tied to viability and serious health circumstances, written so doctors can act quickly without fear. Just as importantly, we ought to reduce the need for abortion by investing in comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception and healthcare, and practical support for parents, disability needs, and adoption\u2014so fewer families are pushed into desperate choices."
