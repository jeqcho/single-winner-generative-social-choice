    "statement": "We can support strong, well-funded policing for real threats while insisting on clear, enforceable limits: de-escalation as the default, force only as a last resort, and mandatory body cameras with independent, transparent review when serious incidents occur. Police should focus on community-based work\u2014knowing the neighborhoods and treating people respectfully\u2014while mental health and other nonviolent crises are handled with dedicated civilian responders when appropriate. That kind of professionalism protects public safety and civil rights at the same time, and it helps good officers do their jobs without excusing the few who abuse their power."

That accountability should come with strong support for officers who follow the rules\u2014proper staffing, practical training, and leadership that removes repeat offenders quickly without demonizing the whole profession. For nonviolent mental-health and crisis calls, pair police with specialized responders so armed officers focus on genuine threats while building trust through consistent, neighborhood-based engagement."

    "statement": "We can strengthen public safety and civil rights at the same time by setting clear, enforceable use-of-force standards that prioritize de-escalation, requiring body cameras with consistent policies, and ensuring independent, transparent review when serious force is used. Police should be resourced and supported to respond decisively to real threats, while shifting appropriate mental health and other nonviolent calls to trained co-responders so armed officers aren\u2019t the default for every crisis. Using public, privacy-conscious data on stops and force to spot patterns, improve training, and reward constitutional, community-trust-building performance can rebuild legitimacy without demonizing the many officers who do the job well."
