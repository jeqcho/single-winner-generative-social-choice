    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, how mistakes are handled, and that the rules apply equally to everyone. A practical middle ground is to combine strong integrity safeguards with broad, fair access: clear standards and independent oversight; auditable records and routine, publicly reported reviews; secure data practices that protect privacy; and plain-language communication that is timely, multilingual, and honest about uncertainties. Institutions should invite community participation through open meetings, citizen advisory panels, and easy ways to ask questions and file complaints\u2014then respond with evidence, not spin. When transparency, accountability, and respectful service are built into everyday operations, confidence can rise even among people who disagree about politics.",

Trust grows when everyday people can watch the process, understand the rules, see consistent enforcement, and know misinformation is met with clear facts\u2014not partisan spin.",

That starts with radical, practical transparency: publish clear goals, budgets, contracts, and timelines; explain decisions in plain language; and provide public dashboards that show what\u2019s working, what isn\u2019t, and why. Pair that openness with real accountability: independent audits and inspectors general with teeth, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight, strong ethics and anti-corruption rules, and prompt, public reporting of mistakes along with concrete fixes.\n\nTrust also depends on respectful access and inclusion. Institutions should communicate in multiple languages and formats, protect privacy, and make it simple for residents to ask questions, appeal decisions, and get timely responses. Finally, institutions should build trust locally by partnering with trusted community anchors\u2014schools, libraries, faith groups, veterans\u2019 and immigrant-serving organizations\u2014and by offering civics and media-literacy education that helps people spot misinformation without telling them what to think. When people can see the rules, see the evidence, and see that everyone is treated consistently, trust grows even when outcomes aren\u2019t everyone\u2019s preferred result.",
