    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and verify how decisions are made\u2014and when rules are applied consistently to everyone. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, checkable safeguards (clear standards, documented chain-of-custody, independent audits, and transparent reporting of errors and fixes) with genuine accessibility (plain-language, multilingual information; convenient service options; and respectful treatment at every point of contact). Institutions should publish performance metrics, open their processes to public observation and qualified third-party review, enforce real consequences for misconduct, and invest in frontline staff training so interactions feel fair and competent. When accountability is visible and service is reliable, confidence rises across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on practices people can see, understand, and independently verify. That means transparent, auditable processes (such as voter\u2011verified paper records and routine post\u2011election audits), clear and timely public reporting of results and any issues, and nonpartisan, community\u2011level oversight with well\u2011trained staff and volunteers. Trust also grows when institutions make participation and information genuinely accessible: plain\u2011language explanations, multilingual materials, outreach through trusted local partners like schools, libraries, and community organizations, and safe, convenient options for eligible people to take part without unnecessary barriers. Finally, institutions should openly acknowledge mistakes, explain how they\u2019re fixed, and consistently enforce rules\u2014because accountability, respectful service, and verifiable procedures are what turn skepticism into confidence.",

That means using auditable records (like voter-verified paper ballots or equally inspectable paper trails), routine post-election audits with published findings, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and transparent reporting of problems and fixes. Oversight should be independent and nonpartisan, with room for bipartisan and community observation so people can see procedures are followed without partisan interference. Trust also grows when institutions communicate in plain language, provide information in multiple languages and formats, and partner with schools, libraries, community groups, and local leaders to teach how the system works and to counter misinformation respectfully. Finally, access must be practical and fair\u2014safe, well-staffed locations; reasonable early and mail options with clear verification; and consistent standards\u2014so integrity and participation reinforce each other.",
