    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can both participate easily and verify that results are accurate. A strong middle ground is to set clear, consistent rules; make registration and voting accessible (including disability access and multilingual information); and protect security with transparent chain-of-custody procedures, auditable paper records, and routine independent post-election audits with publicly posted results. Oversight should be visibly nonpartisan, with opportunities for trained community observers, and officials should communicate what is known, what is still being counted, and why delays can be normal. Finally, sustained civic education and rapid, factual corrections to misinformation\u2014without punishing good-faith questions\u2014help people feel respected and confident that every eligible vote is counted fairly.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the process is easy to understand, visibly fair, and independently verifiable for every eligible voter. We should provide clear, nonpartisan explanations of registration, ballots, counting, and certification in plain language and in the languages people use in their communities, with accessible options for seniors and people with disabilities. Elections should be secured with auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper backups), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent audits (including risk-limiting audits) with results reported promptly and transparently. Oversight should be nonpartisan and include bipartisan and community observation so people can see how issues are handled and corrected. Finally, sustained civic education and proactive responses to misinformation\u2014focused on explaining the process rather than political outcomes\u2014can help more people feel respected, informed, and confident that every valid vote is counted accurately.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on two goals at the same time: make the rules and results easy for ordinary people to understand, and make the system independently verifiable so trust doesn\u2019t depend on politics. That means clear, consistent procedures; accessible voting and public services for seniors, people with disabilities, and busy working families; and plain-language explanations available in the major languages used locally. It also means strong security and accountability: auditable paper trails or equivalent records, secure chain-of-custody, routine independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits), and timely public reporting of results, errors, and fixes. Oversight should be nonpartisan and community-visible\u2014inviting observers, publishing data, and holding open meetings\u2014while protecting privacy and preventing intimidation. Finally, institutions should invest in year-round civic education and respond respectfully to questions and misinformation with facts, transparency, and consistent enforcement of the rules, so people feel heard and can see fairness in practice.",
