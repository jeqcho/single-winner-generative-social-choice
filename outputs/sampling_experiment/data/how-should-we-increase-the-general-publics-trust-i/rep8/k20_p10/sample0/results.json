    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can clearly see how decisions are made, how mistakes are caught, and how leaders are held accountable. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, verifiable safeguards (auditable paper records or equivalent voter-verifiable trails, routine risk-limiting audits, robust cybersecurity, and clear chain-of-custody procedures) with broad, fair access (reliable polling places, workable early or mail options, and consistent rules communicated ahead of time). Oversight should be genuinely independent and bipartisan, with public reporting that is timely and easy to understand\u2014using plain language, multilingual materials, and community partners like schools, libraries, and local civic groups. When institutions invite scrutiny, explain their work without spin, and respond quickly to credible concerns, trust can be earned across political, cultural, and generational lines.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can clearly see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and everyone can understand and participate. We should adopt transparent, consistently applied standards across jurisdictions, use verifiable voting systems with paper records and routine risk-limiting audits, and publish plain-language explanations and public-facing reporting on how ballots are counted and checked. Independent, bipartisan oversight, strong cybersecurity, and well-trained nonpartisan poll workers help show that results are protected from politics and error. Just as important, institutions must communicate early and often in multiple languages, design materials to be easy to use, and do community outreach through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups) so all communities feel respected, included, and confident that every eligible vote is counted with integrity.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should pair transparency with everyday accountability: make decisions and results easy for anyone to verify, and make it clear who is responsible when things go wrong. That means publishing plain-language explanations of rules and methods, using independent and bipartisan (or cross-partisan) oversight, and regularly releasing auditable evidence (e.g., public reports, open data where appropriate, and third-party evaluations) so people can see what was done and why. Trust also grows when institutions serve everyone respectfully\u2014providing multilingual communication, accessible services, and outreach through trusted community places like schools, libraries, clinics, and faith or civic groups. Finally, we should invest in competent staffing, strong cybersecurity and privacy protections, consistent standards across jurisdictions, and clear complaint/appeals processes that respond quickly and fairly. When institutions are verifiable, inclusive, and accountable, confidence rises across political and cultural differences.",
