We should set clear, consistent rules; publish plain-language explanations of how decisions are made and how money is spent; and back that up with independent oversight, routine audits, and transparent reporting when problems occur\u2014along with clear consequences for misconduct. At the same time, institutions must deliver respectful, reliable service to everyone by reducing confusing bureaucracy, protecting privacy, and making information accessible in multiple languages and formats. Finally, leaders and media should commit to timely, factual communication and support ongoing civic education and community forums where residents can ask questions, observe processes, and help shape improvements\u2014so trust is earned through verifiable performance, not partisan reassurance.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few visible, verifiable practices that ordinary people can understand and independently check. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; auditable paper ballots (or voter-verified paper records) with routine, independent risk-limiting audits; strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections; and timely, plain-language public reporting about results, errors, and how fixes were made. Trust also requires fair and accessible participation: clear, consistent rules; well-staffed and safe polling places; reasonable early or mail options where used; and voter education shared through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, faith groups, community organizations) in multiple languages and formats. When institutions invite public observation, explain decisions without partisan spin, and hold themselves accountable with evidence\u2014not slogans\u2014more people can accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",

That means clear, consistent rules; secure systems with a paper record that can be independently audited; routine post-election audits with results published in plain language; and transparent chain-of-custody and incident reporting when problems occur. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and community-facing, with trained observers and opportunities for the public to learn how the process works through schools, libraries, and local \u201copen house\u201d events. Trust also grows when access is fair and practical for working families, seniors, and people with disabilities, and when information is available in the languages communities use at home, including Spanish. If institutions communicate early, honestly, and without partisan spin\u2014showing what happened, what was checked, and how issues were fixed\u2014more people will accept outcomes even when they disagree, because the process is accountable and understandable.",
