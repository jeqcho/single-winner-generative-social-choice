    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can independently see that rules are fair, results are verifiable, and concerns are handled honestly. A durable middle ground is to pair strong, evidence-based security (auditable paper records or paper ballots, documented chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and modern cybersecurity) with equal emphasis on accessibility and service (convenient voting options, disability accommodations, and clear language access). Oversight should be nonpartisan and public-facing: bipartisan observation, transparent incident reporting with timely corrections, and easy-to-read explanations of what happened and why decisions were made. Finally, institutions should earn confidence year-round through consistent standards, open data where privacy allows, community briefings at schools/libraries/faith and civic groups, and clear consequences for proven misconduct\u2014so trust is built on demonstrated performance rather than slogans.",

We should strengthen transparent, auditable safeguards such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records, routine post\u2011election risk\u2011limiting audits, secure chain\u2011of\u2011custody, and strong cybersecurity, with bipartisan and independent oversight and public observation that protects voter privacy. At the same time, we should make participation practical and fair through well\u2011staffed accessible polling places, clear ballot tracking where available, reasonable early and mail options where lawful, and straightforward eligibility checks and accurate voter rolls administered with due process. Finally, institutions should explain how the system works in plain, nonpartisan language\u2014multilingual when needed\u2014using schools, libraries, and community partners, and publish easy-to-read dashboards and incident reports so misinformation has less room to spread and the public can see problems identified and fixed.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on things people can see, verify, and experience as fair: transparent rules, consistent procedures, and independent checks. That means using auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine post-election risk-limiting audits, and public reporting of what was checked and what was found\u2014explained in plain language.\n\nTrust also depends on equal, practical access and respectful service. Institutions should provide clear, multilingual information (including Spanish and other commonly used languages), accessible locations and accommodations, and straightforward options that fit real lives (in-person, early, and where allowed, secure mail voting), while enforcing eligibility rules and maintaining accurate rolls in a transparent, due-process way.\n\nFinally, institutions should invite the public in rather than talking down: open houses at local offices, trained nonpartisan staff, bipartisan/independent observers, and rapid, factual responses to mistakes or irregularities. When safeguards are real, results are verifiable, and communication is honest and understandable, confidence grows across communities and political viewpoints.",
