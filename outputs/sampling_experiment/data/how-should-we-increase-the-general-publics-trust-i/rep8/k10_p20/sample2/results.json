    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can clearly see how decisions are made, how mistakes are caught, and how everyone is treated fairly. We should set transparent, nonpartisan standards for election administration: auditable ballot records (with routine post-election audits like risk-limiting audits), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity practices, and timely public reporting of results and any issues with clear corrective steps. Oversight should be independent and balanced, with trained local officials and community observers, while protecting voter privacy and avoiding unnecessary barriers for eligible voters. Finally, institutions should invest in plain-language, multilingual public education\u2014using schools, libraries, and trusted community groups\u2014so families can understand the process and misinformation has less room to spread.",

That means using auditable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), protecting chain of custody, and conducting routine post-election risk-limiting audits with bipartisan or nonpartisan observers and timely public reporting of results and any incidents. We should pair strong cybersecurity and standardized best practices across jurisdictions with local, well-resourced election offices and well-trained poll workers so procedures are steady and reliable. Finally, trust grows when people can see and understand what\u2019s happening: provide plain-language, multilingual, and visual explanations of how voting, counting, and auditing work; offer accessible voting options for all eligible voters; and support nonpartisan civic education that counters misinformation while respecting voter privacy and equal access.",
