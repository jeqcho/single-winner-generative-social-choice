    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify outcomes independently, and experience fair, respectful service in everyday interactions. A practical middle path is to pair strong integrity safeguards (clear rules, secure records, routine independent audits, and transparent incident reporting) with broad, equal access to information and participation (plain-language explanations, multilingual materials, disability accommodations, and convenient ways to engage). Institutions should publish simple performance dashboards, admit mistakes quickly, explain corrective actions, and invite public observation and feedback through nonpartisan community forums and citizen advisory panels. Finally, consistent enforcement of standards and real accountability for misconduct\u2014without partisan spin\u2014helps people believe the system works for everyone, even when they disagree with particular results.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on what people can verify for themselves: transparent rules, accountable officials, and clear proof that outcomes match the evidence. That means auditable records (such as voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent paper trails), secure chain-of-custody, routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits), and timely public reporting of results and any issues\u2014along with plain-language explanations of what happened and how problems were fixed. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and open to bipartisan and community observers, with consistent standards and adequate funding so local offices can run reliable, well-staffed operations.\n\nAt the same time, trust depends on fairness and equal treatment: voting and public services should be accessible and respectful for eligible people, including working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and communities that need multilingual information. Institutions should also counter misinformation by proactively sharing factual, easy-to-check information through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, community groups) and by publishing the data and audit findings that let the public see the system working. When people can understand the process, observe it, and independently confirm results, confidence grows\u2014even among those who would prefer a different outcome.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should make important decisions easier to verify, easier to understand, and more accountable to the people they serve. That starts with transparent processes (publishing clear rules, timelines, and plain-language explanations of how decisions are made), independent oversight and routine audits that are publicly reported, and open disclosure of mistakes with prompt corrective action. Institutions should protect privacy and security, use consistent standards, and invite public observation and feedback in respectful ways\u2014through community meetings, schools, libraries, and trusted local partners\u2014with information available in multiple languages and accessible formats. Trust grows when services are reliable and fair for everyone, when leaders are held to measurable performance standards, and when everyday people can see that rules are applied consistently without partisan spin.",
