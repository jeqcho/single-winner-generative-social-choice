    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and know that mistakes are acknowledged and corrected. A practical middle-ground approach is to combine (1) transparent, evidence-based standards and regular independent audits, (2) clear accountability for leaders and staff\u2014including public reporting of performance, conflicts of interest, and corrective actions, (3) straightforward, plain-language communication that is timely, multilingual where needed, and honest about uncertainty, and (4) meaningful public participation through open meetings, citizen review panels, and easy ways to give feedback without retaliation. Institutions should protect privacy and individual rights while also enforcing consistent safeguards against corruption and abuse. When transparency, fairness, and service are built into everyday operations\u2014not just promised during crises\u2014trust can be rebuilt across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "We can rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014by combining strong, verifiable safeguards with clear, everyday transparency and fair access. That means using auditable paper ballots (or voter-verified paper records), protecting chain-of-custody, and conducting routine independent post-election risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and bipartisan where appropriate, with meaningful public observation, consistent procedures, and well-trained, adequately funded local administrators. Institutions should communicate early and often\u2014promptly reporting problems, corrections, and final certification\u2014through simple explanations, multilingual materials, and trusted community partners (schools, libraries, churches, and civic groups) to reduce confusion and misinformation. At the same time, rules should protect both integrity and equal participation: secure registration and voter-roll maintenance, reasonable identity/eligibility verification, accessible polling places, and practical voting options for working families and seniors. Trust grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify outcomes independently, and feel the system is fair even when their side loses.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on reforms that are visible, verifiable, and fair, regardless of party. That means clear, consistent rules; secure chain-of-custody for ballots and records; auditable results (such as voter\u2011verified paper ballots or equally auditable records) with routine post\u2011election audits by independent professionals; and transparent public reporting that explains what happened, what was checked, and how issues were corrected. Trust also grows when institutions serve people respectfully and competently: straightforward, plain\u2011language communication (in the languages communities use), accessible options for working families, seniors, and people with disabilities, well\u2011trained staff, and meaningful opportunities for public observation and community oversight. Finally, institutions should proactively counter misinformation with timely, factual updates and publish performance metrics\u2014so everyday residents can see, not just be told, that the system is being run with integrity and accountability.",
