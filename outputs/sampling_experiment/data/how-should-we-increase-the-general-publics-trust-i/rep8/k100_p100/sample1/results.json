    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014we should focus on outcomes people can independently verify and service people can consistently experience. That means setting clear, publicly documented rules; funding competent, nonpartisan administration; and using transparent safeguards such as auditable records, secure chain-of-custody, and routine independent audits with results explained in plain language. Trust also grows when institutions communicate early and honestly about problems, publish what went wrong and how it was fixed, and invite meaningful observation and feedback without turning oversight into partisan theater. Finally, access and integrity must advance together: make it straightforward for every eligible person to participate and understand the process (with language and disability accommodations), while maintaining strong checks that deter and detect fraud or misconduct. When people can see the standards, see the evidence, and see consistent accountability, confidence can return even across deep political disagreements.",

Institutions should invite appropriate public observation and create \u201copen house\u201d opportunities so residents can see how systems work rather than relying on rumors.\n\nTrust also depends on fairness and access. Policies and services should be designed to be user-centered\u2014easy to navigate, accessible to people with disabilities, and reachable through trusted local partners like libraries, schools, clinics, and community organizations. Finally, institutions should proactively counter misinformation with timely, factual communication and consistent evidence-based practices, so confidence comes from verifiable procedures, not partisan messaging.",
