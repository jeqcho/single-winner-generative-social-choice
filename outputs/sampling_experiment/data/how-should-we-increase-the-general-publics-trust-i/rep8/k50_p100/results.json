    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and know that mistakes are acknowledged and fixed. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, measurable integrity safeguards (clear standards, independent audits/inspections, published performance metrics, and transparent incident reporting) with real accessibility and responsiveness (plain-language and multilingual explanations, open public meetings, easy ways to file complaints and track resolutions, and protections against discrimination or favoritism). Institutions should be locally present but held to consistent baseline rules, funded to do the job well, and overseen by diverse, nonpartisan boards with real authority. When transparency, accountability, and equal treatment are built into everyday operations\u2014not just promised during crises\u2014confidence can rebuild across political and cultural lines.",

That means using auditable paper records (or voter-verified paper backups), routine independent post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits), strong cybersecurity and chain\u2011of\u2011custody protections, and well-trained, adequately funded local election offices with nonpartisan and bipartisan oversight. Just as important, officials should communicate changes, problems, and results promptly and plainly\u2014using multilingual, accessible materials and community partners like schools, libraries, faith groups, and local organizations\u2014so people don\u2019t have to rely on rumors or partisan spin. When security is real, rules are consistent, access is fair, and the public can observe how decisions are made and mistakes are corrected, confidence grows even when people dislike the outcome.",

Trust grows when institutions treat people with respect, show their work, invite community observation and feedback, protect privacy, and deliver reliable service\u2014so families can see that the same rules apply to everyone and that accountability is real.",
