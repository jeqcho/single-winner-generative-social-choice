    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify outcomes, and feel they are treated fairly and respectfully. A practical middle-ground approach is to combine strong, evidence-based safeguards (auditable records such as paper trails, secure chain-of-custody, routine independent post\u2011election audits, and clear standards for cybersecurity) with broad, lawful access and consistent service (well-staffed accessible polling options, reasonable early or mail voting where allowed, and accommodations for disabilities). Institutions should publish plain-language, multilingual explanations of the rules, the counting and auditing process, and any problems found\u2014along with how they were fixed\u2014so misinformation has less room to spread. Finally, create visible, nonpartisan accountability: open public observation where appropriate, bipartisan and independent oversight, and regular community briefings by local officials, so trust is earned through transparency and performance rather than partisan reassurance.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the system easy to verify, easy to observe, and easy to understand, without making participation harder for eligible voters. That means using auditable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), routine risk-limiting post-election audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with meaningful public observation. Trust also depends on clear communication: publish timely results and plain-language explanations of how votes are counted, audited, and corrected when mistakes occur, using accessible formats and multiple languages through trusted local partners like schools, libraries, community centers, and civic groups. By pairing rigorous, inspectable safeguards with respectful, transparent public education and consistent rules, people can see for themselves that outcomes are accurate, fair, and accountable.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on steps that people across backgrounds can see, understand, and verify. That means transparent, consistently applied rules; secure, auditable records (including a voter\u2011verified paper trail where feasible); routine independent post\u2011process audits with results published in plain language; and clear chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity protections with honest incident reporting when problems occur. Trust also grows when institutions treat people with respect and make participation practical: accessible locations and hours, well\u2011trained staff, disability accommodations, and clear information in the languages communities use. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing, nonpartisan public education and community partnerships (schools, libraries, faith groups, veterans\u2019 and civic organizations) so residents can ask questions, observe appropriate parts of the process, and see how mistakes are corrected. When people can verify the work, understand the safeguards, and feel included and fairly treated, confidence rises\u2014even when outcomes are disappointing.",
