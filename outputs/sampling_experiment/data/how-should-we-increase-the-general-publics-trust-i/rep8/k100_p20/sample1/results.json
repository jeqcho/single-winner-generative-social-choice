At the same time, participation should be practical for eligible voters through well-run polling places, reliable early and mail options with verification, and accommodations for disabilities and language needs.\n\nTo reduce suspicion and misinformation, institutions should communicate in plain language before, during, and after major decisions: what will happen, how safeguards work, what went wrong if problems occur, and how issues are fixed\u2014without spin. Regular public briefings, open-data reporting where privacy allows, and opportunities for bipartisan and community observers (including trained nonpartisan citizen panels) can help people verify claims with their own eyes. Trust won\u2019t come from asking people to \u201cjust believe\u201d; it comes from making processes verifiable, outcomes explainable, and leaders accountable when standards aren\u2019t met.",

Trust also grows when voters get plain\u2011language, timely explanations of how votes are counted, what safeguards are in place, and why results may take time\u2014shared through local, trusted channels like schools, libraries, community centers, and faith and civic groups.

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on reforms that are visible, verifiable, fair, and practical for everyday people. That means using auditable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper backups), conducting routine risk-limiting audits with bipartisan and independent oversight, and publishing plain-language results that explain what was checked, what was found, and how any issues were fixed. We should also strengthen cybersecurity and secure chain-of-custody procedures, while keeping voting accessible through reliable polling locations, reasonable early voting and secure mail options, disability accommodations, and language access so every eligible voter can participate with confidence. Where communities disagree about policies like voter ID or voter roll maintenance, we should set clear, consistent rules statewide, pair them with free and easy ways to comply, and measure whether they reduce fraud without blocking eligible voters. Finally, rebuilding trust requires ongoing public-facing transparency\u2014community briefings, school/library/church-based nonpartisan education, open houses at election offices, and timely communication from officials and media that explains the process before, during, and after Election Day\u2014so people don\u2019t have to rely on rumors to understand how decisions are made.",
