    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are followed, and count on fair treatment no matter who they are or what they believe. We should set clear, consistent standards; publish simple explanations of how decisions, spending, and outcomes are measured; and invite independent review\u2014audits, inspector generals, courts, journalists, and qualified third parties\u2014so errors are found and corrected in the open. Institutions should communicate early and honestly about problems, protect privacy, disclose conflicts of interest, and enforce real consequences for misconduct. At the same time, trust improves when services work well in daily life: reliable staffing, responsive customer-service style help, accessible locations and hours, and materials in plain language and multiple languages. Finally, partnering with local community organizations and creating structured ways for residents to observe, give feedback, and participate helps replace rumors with firsthand understanding and makes accountability feel real.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on what people can see, understand, and independently verify: clear rules, transparent operations, and real accountability. That means using auditable systems (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records), protecting chain of custody, and conducting routine independent, risk-limiting audits with results posted publicly in plain language. Institutions should communicate early and often\u2014explaining how decisions are made, what safeguards exist, and how errors or anomalies are handled\u2014without partisan spin and with timely public reporting.\n\nTrust also grows when services are accessible and fair. Make participation straightforward for eligible people through reliable staffing and locations, reasonable early/absentee options where appropriate, strong cybersecurity and privacy protections, and consistent procedures that reduce confusion. Finally, invest in community-facing education and outreach\u2014through schools, libraries, community centers, faith groups, and local leaders\u2014using multilingual, easy-to-follow materials (including visual guides) and opportunities for respectful public observation. When institutions are transparent, verifiable, and responsive to everyday people, confidence increases even when outcomes are disappointing.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild broad public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on what people can verify, understand, and experience as fair. That means using secure, auditable systems (including paper records where feasible), routine independent and bipartisan checks like risk-limiting audits, strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections, and timely public reporting that clearly explains what was found and how problems are fixed. Trust also grows when access is reliable and consistent\u2014well-staffed locations, reasonable early and mail options where appropriate, clear rules, and strong language and disability access\u2014so eligible people can participate without unnecessary barriers. Finally, institutions should communicate in plain language (and with visuals for families), share information through trusted local places like schools, libraries, community centers, and faith groups, and partner with community leaders to calmly counter misinformation. When the process is transparent, accountable, and inclusive, people are more likely to accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",
