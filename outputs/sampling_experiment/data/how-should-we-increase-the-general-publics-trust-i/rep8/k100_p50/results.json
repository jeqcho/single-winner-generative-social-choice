    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can verify that rules are fair, results are accurate, and officials are accountable regardless of party. We should set clear, consistent procedures that protect both access and integrity: secure ballot handling with an auditable paper record, routine independent post-election audits with publicly posted findings, strong cybersecurity, and transparent reporting when problems occur and how they are fixed. Trust also depends on service and communication: plain-language explanations of how decisions are made, multilingual materials, accessible polling and voting options for working families, seniors, and people with disabilities, and nonpartisan partnerships with local community organizations to answer questions and counter misinformation. When oversight is open to observers across viewpoints and institutions respond quickly, respectfully, and with evidence, confidence can be rebuilt even among people who disagree politically.",

We should use secure, auditable systems with voter-verified paper records, routine risk-limiting audits, and clear chain-of-custody procedures, with meaningful nonpartisan and bipartisan observation and publicly posted audit results. At the same time, participation must be straightforward and accessible for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and immigrant communities through well-staffed polling places, secure early and mail options, and consistent rules that are explained in plain language and multiple languages. Institutions should communicate quickly and factually about procedures, mistakes, and fixes; invest in civic education and trusted community partnerships (schools, libraries, healthcare, and local groups); and counter misinformation with transparent data and calm, nonpartisan guidance. Trust is earned through visible accountability, respectful service, and verification that anyone can understand.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can clearly see how decisions are made, how mistakes are caught, and how everyone is treated fairly. A strong, bridging approach is to pair easy-to-understand transparency with verifiable safeguards: use auditable records (such as voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent), conduct routine independent risk-limiting audits, protect chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and publish clear, timely reports of results, discrepancies, and fixes in plain language. Trust also depends on equal and respectful access, so institutions should offer convenient options that work for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and language communities, with multilingual information and help from trusted local partners like schools, libraries, employers, faith groups, and community organizations. Finally, institutions should invest in nonpartisan civic education and rapid, evidence-based responses to misinformation, and create accountable channels\u2014public observation, bipartisan/independent oversight, and community feedback\u2014so people don\u2019t have to rely on political spin to believe the system is fair.",
