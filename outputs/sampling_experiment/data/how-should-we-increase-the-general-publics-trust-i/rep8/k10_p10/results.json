    "new_statement": "Increasing the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014requires results people can independently verify and leaders who are visibly accountable. We should standardize basic safeguards across jurisdictions, including auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), routine independent risk-limiting audits, strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody procedures, and transparent public reporting that is easy to understand. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan, with clear conflict-of-interest rules and open observation so all communities and political viewpoints can see the process is fair. At the same time, access must be protected through well-run polling places, reasonable voting options, disability and language accommodations, and consistent rules applied evenly. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and factually about problems and fixes, publish performance metrics, and invest in civic education that teaches how the system works\u2014so trust is built through clarity, competence, and proof rather than slogans.",

That includes secure, auditable systems with paper records where possible, routine independent risk\u2011limiting audits, and bipartisan oversight, paired with clear, plain\u2011language public reporting about how decisions are made and results are verified. Trust also depends on fair and consistent rules, well\u2011trained staff, and strong protections against intimidation, fraud, and cyber threats.

That means independent, nonpartisan administration; auditable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent voter-verifiable trails); routine risk-limiting audits and transparent reporting that any member of the public can understand; and strong cybersecurity and training for staff. Trust also depends on fairness and access: clear, stable rules; well-run polling locations; accommodations for seniors and people with disabilities; and language-accessible information so everyone knows how decisions are made and how to raise concerns. Finally, institutions should communicate early and plainly about errors, fixes, and results, publish data and processes for independent review, and counter misinformation with timely, evidence-based public education\u2014because trust grows when people can see both integrity and accountability in action.",
