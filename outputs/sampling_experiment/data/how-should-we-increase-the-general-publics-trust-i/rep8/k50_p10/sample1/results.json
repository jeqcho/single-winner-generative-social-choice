    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify outcomes, and expect the same fair treatment no matter who they are or where they live. A practical middle-ground approach is to pair strong security with clear transparency: use voting systems with auditable paper records, run routine post-election audits with published methods and results, and protect poll workers and election infrastructure with modern cybersecurity and safety planning. At the same time, keep administration professionally nonpartisan, welcome bipartisan and public observation under clear rules, and communicate early and often in plain language (and multiple languages where needed) about timelines, safeguards, and how concerns are investigated. Finally, make participation accessible\u2014reasonable early and mail options, disability accommodations, and consistent baseline standards\u2014so integrity and inclusion reinforce each other rather than compete.",

We should prioritize transparent, nonpartisan administration with strong security: paper ballots (or voter-verifiable records), routine risk-limiting post-election audits, and clear procedures for investigating and publicly explaining any irregularities. Results and safeguards should be communicated quickly in plain language, with proactive steps to counter misinformation and publish data that protects privacy while enabling accountability. Finally, trust requires equal respect and access for every eligible voter\u2014safe polling places, disability accommodations, language access, and consistent, easy-to-find voter information\u2014so participation feels both secure and welcoming across communities.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should focus on everyday basics: show your work, treat people fairly, and fix problems openly. That means clear, plain-language explanations of how decisions are made, where money goes, and what rules apply; independent oversight and regular audits with results shared publicly; and simple ways for the public to verify key claims (including accessible records, open meetings where appropriate, and respectful opportunities for observation and feedback). Institutions should protect privacy and safety while still being transparent\u2014using strong cybersecurity, consistent standards, and prompt, credible responses when mistakes or irregularities occur. Trust also grows when services are reliable and inclusive: easy-to-use processes, accommodations for disabilities, language access, and local community outreach through schools, libraries, and trusted community organizations. Finally, leaders should model accountability\u2014publish performance measures, enforce ethics rules, and accept responsibility when things go wrong\u2014so people across backgrounds can see the system is working for them, not for insiders.",
