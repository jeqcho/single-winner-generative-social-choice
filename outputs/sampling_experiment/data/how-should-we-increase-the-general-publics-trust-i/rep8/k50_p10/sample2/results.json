    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and experience services that work for everyone. We should strengthen transparency and accountability through clear standards, independent oversight, regular public reporting, and simple ways for residents to check outcomes for themselves (for example, open data, plain-language explanations, and public forums). Institutions should reduce conflicts of interest, enforce ethics rules consistently, and admit mistakes quickly with concrete corrective actions. At the same time, access must be practical and equal\u2014multilingual information, disability accommodations, and outreach through trusted local partners\u2014so no community feels ignored. Finally, institutions should communicate in a nonpartisan, evidence-based way and work with educators, libraries, faith groups, and community organizations to build civic understanding and resilience to misinformation.",

That means nonpartisan, transparent administration; paper ballots as a durable record; routine independent post\u2011election audits (including risk\u2011limiting audits); and strong cybersecurity and safety protections for voters and poll workers. Just as important, institutions must communicate clearly and promptly about how decisions are made and what safeguards are in place, using plain language and multilingual materials delivered through trusted local places like schools, libraries, community centers, and faith communities. Expanding accessible options for working families and people with disabilities, inviting bipartisan and everyday\u2011citizen oversight, and proactively countering misinformation with factual, consistent updates can help more people feel included\u2014and more willing to accept outcomes even when they disagree.",

That means clear, consistent rules applied the same way everywhere; strong security (including cybersecurity and protections for workers and voters); and verifiable records such as paper ballots with routine, independent audits that the public can observe. Institutions should communicate early and often in plain language and multiple languages, using formats that work for busy families and young people (short videos, pictures, school and library materials, community meetings, TV/radio), and they should promptly explain what happened when problems occur and how they were fixed. Trust also grows when communities are included: bipartisan and citizen oversight, partnerships with local leaders (schools, faith groups, clinics, neighborhood organizations), accessible services for people with disabilities, and fair access so working people can participate. Finally, institutions should actively counter misinformation with transparent evidence and accountability\u2014so even when people disagree with outcomes, they can still believe the system is honest, respectful, and worthy of confidence.",
