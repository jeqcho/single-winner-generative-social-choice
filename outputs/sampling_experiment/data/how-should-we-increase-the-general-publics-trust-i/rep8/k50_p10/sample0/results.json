    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and independently verify that rules are fair, consistently applied, and that errors are found and corrected. We should combine secure, auditable systems (such as paper records or equivalent verifiable trails), routine independent and cross-partisan audits, and strong privacy protections with clear, plain-language public reporting about how decisions are made and how results are confirmed. Trust also improves when access is practical and welcoming: well-trained nonpartisan staff, convenient voting options, and multilingual, community-based education delivered through schools, libraries, faith groups, and local organizations people already rely on. By emphasizing transparency, accountability, and respectful inclusion\u2014rather than partisan reassurance\u2014we give the public concrete reasons to believe outcomes are legitimate and that every eligible voice is treated with equal care.",

Finally, institutions should invest in clear, nonpartisan, plain-language and multilingual education\u2014shared through schools, libraries, and trusted local community organizations\u2014so every community can see how votes are cast and counted and feel confident that every eligible voter can participate fairly.",

When institutions show their work, invite broad oversight, and correct problems in the open, confidence can grow across political views and communities.",
