    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability, without feeling that participation is being made harder or that decisions are made behind closed doors. A practical middle ground is to set transparent baseline standards for every jurisdiction: voter-verifiable ballots (paper or paper-backed), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine independent audits with results published in plain language, and open observation rules that protect voter privacy. At the same time, we should keep voting workable for real life by maintaining multiple secure ways to vote, reducing long lines, and providing multilingual, accessible information through trusted local messengers. Institutions should also commit to correcting mistakes quickly and publicly, and to sustained civics education and proactive, nonpartisan communication so misinformation has less room to take hold.",

We should adopt transparent, consistently applied procedures that use auditable paper records (or equivalent voter-verifiable records), routine independent risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with publicly posted, plain-language audit results and explanations of any issues. At the same time, institutions should make participation practical and inclusive\u2014through well-run local administration, accessible options like early voting or secure vote-by-mail where offered, disability accommodations, and clear multilingual information\u2014paired with sustained, nonpartisan civics education and rapid, factual communication to counter misinformation.

Trust also grows when access is practical for real life\u2014reasonable early and mail options, enough staffed locations, and accommodations for disabilities\u2014while protecting privacy and civil rights. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often through trusted local messengers (schools, community groups, worksites, and faith and cultural organizations) with multilingual materials, straightforward explanations of decisions, and transparent ways to report problems and see them resolved.
