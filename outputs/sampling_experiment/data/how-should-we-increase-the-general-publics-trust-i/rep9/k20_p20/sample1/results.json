Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and open to observers from across the community, with timely reporting of problems and how they were resolved. Just as important, officials and civic partners should invest in year-round voter education and rapid, transparent corrections to misinformation so people see consistent facts, consistent procedures, and consistent accountability.",
