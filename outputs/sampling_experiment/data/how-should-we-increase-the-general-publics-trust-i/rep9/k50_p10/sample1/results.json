    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can both participate easily and verify that rules are applied fairly and consistently. A practical middle ground is to set clear, uniform standards: auditable voting records (such as paper-backed ballots), strong chain-of-custody and cyber protections, and routine independent audits with results published in plain language. At the same time, access should be strengthened through convenient options (early voting, vote-by-mail where available, well-run in-person sites) and customer-service\u2013level support for voters, including multilingual materials and help lines. Finally, institutions should invite public observation and community partnerships\u2014across political and cultural lines\u2014to explain processes, correct misinformation quickly with evidence, and hold officials accountable without turning election administration into a partisan fight.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in key institutions\u2014including elections\u2014we should pair strong, consistent safeguards with clear, everyday transparency and respectful outreach. That means verifiable records (like paper ballots or auditable systems where relevant), routine independent audits and public reporting, and simple explanations of how decisions are made, checked, and corrected when mistakes happen. Rules should be applied fairly across communities, with protections for eligible participation and reasonable security measures, and with trained professionals and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight so no single group controls the process. Just as important, institutions should communicate in plain language and in the languages people speak at home, partner with local schools, faith groups, and community organizations, and teach practical civics so families\u2014including young people and seniors\u2014can see the process, understand the evidence, and feel confident their voices are respected.",
