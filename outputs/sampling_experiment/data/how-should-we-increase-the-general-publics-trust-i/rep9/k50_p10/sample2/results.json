We should make key public processes\u2014especially elections\u2014transparent and verifiable by using a voter-verifiable paper record (or equivalent), routine independent audits with publicly posted results, strong chain-of-custody, and regular cybersecurity testing. Administration should be professionally nonpartisan, with bipartisan and community observer access and consistent rules that are applied the same way to everyone. At the same time, trust requires inclusion: convenient voting options, disability access, and multilingual, plain-language explanations of how decisions are made and how concerns can be reported and resolved. Finally, institutions should respond quickly to mistakes and misinformation by sharing evidence, correcting errors openly, and measuring performance publicly\u2014so confidence is earned through demonstrated integrity rather than partisan messaging.",
