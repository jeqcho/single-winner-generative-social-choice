    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, based on evidence, and with real accountability\u2014regardless of who is in power. Institutions should publish clear standards for how decisions are made, open up key processes to independent review (including public reporting of findings and corrective actions), and make essential information easy to understand through plain-language, multilingual communication. They should also protect individual rights and privacy, provide accessible ways for people to participate and raise concerns, and enforce consistent consequences for misconduct. When institutions deliver reliable service, explain their reasoning, admit mistakes, and show measurable improvement over time, trust can be earned across political and cultural lines.",

Institutions should communicate in plain language, share timely results and explanations when problems occur, invite respectful public observation and community participation, and partner with schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations to expand nonpartisan civic education and counter misinformation. Finally, services must be accessible to everyone\u2014through multilingual information, disability accommodations, well-trained staff, and convenient participation options\u2014so every community can participate confidently and hold institutions accountable.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should make important public decisions easier for people to see, understand, and verify\u2014without requiring them to \u201cjust trust\u201d leaders or headlines. That means setting clear, consistent rules; publishing plain-language explanations and open data about how decisions are made; and building routine, independent oversight and audits whose methods and results are public. Institutions should be locally present and responsive\u2014holding regular community forums, partnering with schools, libraries, faith and cultural groups, and offering multilingual, accessible information\u2014so people can ask questions and get answers from real officials, not rumors. Trust grows when systems are both secure and fair: strong privacy protections, strong cybersecurity and record-keeping, equal service across neighborhoods, and accountable consequences for corruption, harassment, or misinformation that targets the public. When institutions deliver reliable service, communicate transparently about problems, and invite public observation and participation, confidence can be rebuilt across political and cultural divides.",
