We should set transparent, enforceable standards for ethics and performance; publish understandable data and independent evaluations; and create regular, public ways for residents to ask questions and help shape priorities. Accountability must be real and nonpartisan: strong conflict-of-interest rules, independent inspectors and audits, protections for whistleblowers, and timely corrections when problems are found. At the same time, institutions should deliver reliable, respectful service\u2014equal access, plain-language communication in multiple languages, and community-based outreach\u2014so trust is earned through both open evidence and everyday competence.",

We should use voter-verified paper records (or auditable paper trails), routine independent risk-limiting audits, strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody procedures, and transparent, timely public reporting that explains results and any issues in plain language. Institutions should be run by well-trained, nonpartisan professionals with bipartisan and public observation opportunities, consistent rules that are clearly communicated, and real accountability when standards aren\u2019t met. At the same time, trust requires equal, practical access: well-resourced local offices, accessible polling locations, early and mail voting options with clear instructions, and multilingual information delivered through trusted community partners (schools, libraries, community centers) to reduce confusion and counter misinformation. When safeguards are visible, communication is honest, and participation is inclusive, confidence can be rebuilt across communities.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on visible fairness, verifiable results, and respectful service to every community. That means using voter-verified paper records (or an auditable paper trail), strict chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results and methods posted in plain language. Institutions should be nonpartisan and accountable, with consistent baseline standards, well-trained staff, and open public observation so people can see how decisions are made and corrected when errors occur. Trust also grows when access is real: clear multilingual information (including Spanish and other common local languages), ADA-compliant options, convenient hours and locations, and reliable mail/early voting where offered\u2014while protecting privacy and civil rights. Finally, we should invest in year-round civic education and local partnerships (schools, libraries, community groups, faith communities, and workplaces) to answer questions, counter misinformation with facts, and invite the public into the process, so confidence comes from evidence and lived experience\u2014not political claims.",
