    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when they earn it through visible fairness, competence, and humility. We should make key decisions and outcomes easier for the public to verify\u2014clear rules, open data where privacy allows, independent oversight and regular audits, and straightforward explanations of what happened when mistakes occur and how they were fixed. At the same time, institutions must treat people with respect by ensuring equal access to services and participation (including language support, disability accommodations, and options that work for busy schedules), enforcing protections against intimidation or discrimination, and applying standards consistently. Finally, sustained trust requires ongoing two-way communication: nonpartisan public education, community partnerships, and meaningful opportunities for feedback so people can see that their concerns change how institutions operate.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in our democratic institutions\u2014grows when people can see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and everyone can participate without barriers. We should commit to transparent, nonpartisan administration with verifiable voting systems (including paper records), routine independent post-election audits such as risk-limiting audits, strong cybersecurity, and clear, timely reporting when problems arise. Just as important, we need plain-language, multilingual public information and civics education that explain how ballots are protected, counted, and checked, along with accessible options for working people, disabled voters, and diverse communities (adequate polling locations, early voting, and secure mail or drop-off options). By pairing rigorous verification with respectful community outreach and protections against intimidation and misinformation, we can show\u2014consistently and nationwide\u2014that every eligible voter\u2019s voice is counted accurately and equally.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions, we should make decisions and services transparent, consistent, and easy for ordinary people to verify\u2014while treating everyone with fairness and respect. That means clear, plain\u2011language and multilingual communication about how rules work and how money is spent; strong, independent oversight (audits, inspectors general, and public reporting) with real consequences for misconduct; and reliable, secure systems that protect privacy and civil rights. Trust also grows when access is practical for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and rural communities\u2014through convenient hours, accessible locations, and straightforward online and in\u2011person options. Finally, institutions should partner with trusted local messengers (schools, veterans\u2019 groups, faith and community organizations, unions, and small businesses), respond quickly and honestly when problems occur, and invest in civic education and media literacy so people can distinguish facts from rumors. If people can see how decisions are made, confirm that standards are applied equally, and experience competent service in daily life, confidence will rise across communities and political differences.",
