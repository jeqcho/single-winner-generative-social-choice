    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are fair, understandable, and accountable\u2014especially in high-stakes areas like elections, public health, policing, and schools. We should set clear, consistent standards; publish plain-language explanations of how decisions are made; and make key data, contracts, and performance metrics easy to access and independently reviewed while protecting privacy and security. Institutions should use nonpartisan, professionally trained administrators; routine independent audits and oversight with representation from multiple viewpoints; and simple, reliable ways for the public to report problems and get timely responses. Trust also depends on equal treatment and real access, so services and information should be accessible across languages, disability needs, and communities, with regular community forums and partnerships with trusted local groups. Finally, leaders should acknowledge mistakes, correct them transparently, and enforce meaningful consequences for misconduct\u2014because trust is earned through consistent honesty, competence, and responsiveness.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on transparency people can verify, nonpartisan accountability, and practical access for every eligible voter. That means using auditable systems (such as voter-verified paper records), conducting routine independent post-election audits with publicly posted results, and strengthening cybersecurity and equipment reviews. Institutions should communicate clearly and consistently in plain language and multiple languages, explaining how decisions are made, how outcomes are checked, and how concerns are addressed. Trust also grows when services are easy to use and fairly delivered across communities\u2014through well-trained staff, dependable operations, and accessible options like early, in-person, and mail participation with strong privacy protections. Finally, we should invest in ongoing civic education and partner with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, community groups, and workplaces\u2014to counter misinformation with timely facts and demonstrate that rules are applied consistently and fairly.",
