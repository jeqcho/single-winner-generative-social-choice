    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that the rules are fair, the work is competent, and leaders are accountable\u2014regardless of party or ideology. We should standardize clear, easy-to-verify processes (including auditable records, independent oversight, and public reporting of performance and security), protect privacy and individual rights, and make participation practical for working people through accessible services and accommodations. Institutions should communicate in plain language, share data and decisions openly, admit mistakes quickly, and invite community partners to help educate the public and counter misinformation with timely facts. When institutions consistently deliver results, treat everyone with respect, and provide real ways for the public to monitor and challenge outcomes, trust can be rebuilt over time.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on processes people can verify, understand, and see working fairly in their own communities. That means nonpartisan, professionally run administration; secure voting systems with a clear paper trail; strong cybersecurity; and routine, transparent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with publicly available results. Trust also grows when participation is practical and inclusive: adequate and well-staffed polling places, early voting and secure vote-by-mail options with safeguards, disability accommodations, and clear information in plain language and multiple languages. Finally, institutions should proactively counter misinformation by communicating quickly and clearly\u2014through trusted local partners like community groups, schools, and service organizations\u2014so people know how decisions are made, how errors are caught, and how accountability is enforced while protecting voters\u2019 privacy and rights.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few standards everyone can verify: clear rules, transparent processes, and real accountability. That means using auditable paper records, strong cybersecurity, and routine independent post-election audits whose results are published in plain language. Administration should be professional and nonpartisan, with clear safeguards for privacy and voting rights, and with stable funding so polling places are well-staffed, respectful, and convenient.\n\nTrust also depends on equal, practical access: reliable early voting and secure mail options with sensible protections, disability accommodations, and clear information in the languages people use at home. Finally, institutions should communicate proactively\u2014through schools, local media, and trusted community partners\u2014so people can see how decisions are made, how mistakes are corrected, and how misinformation is addressed with timely, factual proof. When government consistently shows its work and welcomes oversight, more people across backgrounds can believe the system is fair and worth participating in.",
