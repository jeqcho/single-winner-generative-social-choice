    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can verify that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and the outcomes are explained clearly. A workable middle ground is to standardize core integrity protections nationwide (paper-backed or otherwise voter-verifiable records, strong chain-of-custody, cybersecurity safeguards, and routine independent post-election audits such as risk-limiting audits) while keeping voting accessible through well-managed options like early voting and vote-by-mail where feasible. Oversight should be truly nonpartisan and include representatives from multiple parties and community stakeholders, with transparent reporting, open observation, and clear procedures for recounts and challenges. Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, publish timely data about how ballots are processed, and respond quickly to misinformation with evidence and accessible public briefings. By pairing rigorous accountability with respectful, inclusive service at polling places and in outreach, institutions can demonstrate competence, neutrality, and earned trust over time.",

We should require voter-verifiable paper records (or equivalent), protect strong chain of custody and cybersecurity, and conduct routine, independent post-election risk-limiting audits with bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight. Election offices should publish timely, plain-language explanations of how ballots are cast, secured, counted, audited, and certified, with clear multilingual information and accessible voter education delivered through trusted community partners. By investing in well-trained poll workers, secure infrastructure, convenient voting options that protect privacy, and rapid, factual responses to misinformation and concerns, we can show that outcomes are accurate and that every eligible voter\u2019s voice is respected.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014we should make the rules and results easy to verify, easy to understand, and applied fairly to everyone. That means clear standards for security and privacy, paper or otherwise independently verifiable records, routine bipartisan/independent audits that the public can observe and review, and transparent reporting that explains what happened in plain language. Institutions should communicate early and often through trusted community channels (schools, libraries, healthcare settings, local leaders) with multilingual information, so families can access accurate guidance and know how to ask questions or report concerns. At the same time, we should protect access and civil rights by offering practical options (well-staffed polling places, early voting, and secure vote-by-mail where available), strong training and accountability for staff, and rapid, nonpartisan corrections of misinformation. When people can see the safeguards, understand the process, and know that problems are addressed openly and consistently, trust grows across generations and communities.",
