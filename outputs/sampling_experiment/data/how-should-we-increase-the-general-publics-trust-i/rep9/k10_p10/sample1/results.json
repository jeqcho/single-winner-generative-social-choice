    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, how mistakes are caught, and how leaders are held accountable\u2014regardless of party or ideology. We should set clear, nonpartisan standards for transparency (plain-language explanations, open data where privacy allows, and public reporting of performance), independent oversight (inspections, audits, and conflict-of-interest rules), and consistent consequences for misconduct. Institutions should make participation and feedback easy\u2014through accessible services, multilingual communication, and regular community forums\u2014while protecting individual privacy and security. By showing our work, measuring results, correcting errors quickly, and treating people with respect, institutions can earn confidence over time rather than asking for it.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in our elections, we should focus on processes that are secure, transparent, and easy for ordinary voters to verify and understand. That means nonpartisan administration with bipartisan oversight and public observers, routine risk\u2011limiting post\u2011election audits, and voting systems with auditable paper records (or equally verifiable equivalents) that can be independently reviewed. Election officials should communicate in plain language\u2014before, during, and after Election Day\u2014about how ballots are protected, how they are counted, and how any problems or discrepancies are investigated and resolved, with timely public reporting. Trust also depends on fair access: well\u2011trained poll workers, short lines, strong privacy protections, and clear materials in multiple languages and accessible formats, alongside outreach that counters misinformation with facts and transparency. With prudent investment in infrastructure, training, and voter education, we can make it clear that every eligible voter can participate and that every vote is counted accurately and accountably.",

That means clear rules applied consistently, independent and bipartisan oversight, routine audits and public reporting, and systems that leave an auditable trail (like paper records or equivalent verifiable backups) so results and services can be checked by ordinary people\u2014not just insiders. Institutions should communicate in plain language, quickly and honestly, including what went wrong and how it will be fixed, while protecting privacy and safety. Trust also grows when access is practical and welcoming: well-trained staff, short lines, strong customer service, disability and language access (including Spanish), and outreach through schools, community groups, and local leaders. Finally, institutions should show fiscal responsibility and integrity by preventing conflicts of interest, publishing performance metrics, and inviting the public to observe and ask questions\u2014so confidence comes from transparency, competence, and respect, not partisan messaging.",
