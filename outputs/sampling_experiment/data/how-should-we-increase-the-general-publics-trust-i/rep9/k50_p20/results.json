    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the rules are clear, the evidence is verifiable, and the process is welcoming to every eligible voter\u2014regardless of party or zip code. We should set baseline national standards that states can meet or exceed: voter-verifiable paper records (or equivalent auditable backups), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine risk-limiting audits, and transparent reporting of results and any problems with prompt correction. At the same time, access must remain broad and non-discriminatory, with practical options like early voting, accessible polling places, and secure vote-by-mail where offered. Finally, election offices should communicate in plain language, publish audit and security documentation, and partner with trusted local community groups, media, and schools to explain how the system works and to counter misinformation with facts rather than partisan spin.",

We should use voter-verifiable paper ballots (or paper-backed records), conduct routine risk-limiting post-election audits, enforce strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and provide bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with public observation that is respectful and accessible. Just as important, election officials should communicate in plain language with timely, factual updates and publish easy-to-read audit results so people can see how a result was confirmed. Finally, we should expand nonpartisan civic and voter education through schools, libraries, and community organizations, while maintaining broad, non-discriminatory access (including disability accommodations and practical voting options) so every eligible voter can participate confidently and know their vote is protected and counted.",

That means using verifiable ballots (paper where feasible, or voter-verifiable records), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) conducted with bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight and publicly reported in plain language. Trust also grows when voting is practical and inclusive\u2014reliable polling locations, disability accommodations, reasonable early and mail options, and accurate, easy-to-find information in the languages communities use. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often with facts, publish transparent performance and incident reports, invite public observation in respectful ways, and invest in year-round civic education so families and students understand how the process works. The goal is a system that is secure and accountable without making participation harder for eligible voters\u2014and where anyone can see how outcomes were reached.",
