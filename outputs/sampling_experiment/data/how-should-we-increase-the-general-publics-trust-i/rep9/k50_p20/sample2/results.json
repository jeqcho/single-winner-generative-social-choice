    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are followed, and experience fair treatment regardless of politics, identity, or zip code. We should set clear, publicly posted standards; publish plain-language explanations and timely data; and use independent, cross-partisan oversight and routine audits so mistakes are found and fixed rather than hidden. Institutions must pair integrity safeguards (strong security, privacy protections, clear chain-of-custody for records, and consequences for wrongdoing) with real accessibility (language access, disability accommodations, and multiple ways to participate). Finally, trust is earned through everyday performance: responsive customer-service style communication, community partnerships with trusted local messengers, and consistent accountability when outcomes fall short.",

Trust also grows when access is real and respectful: clear rules, well\u2011resourced local offices, accessible polling places and accommodations for people with disabilities, and information shared in multiple languages through trusted community channels. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often\u2014sharing data, standards, and timelines, correcting misinformation with facts, and providing clear ways for the public to observe, ask questions, and report concerns\u2014so accountability is visible and participation feels fair for everyone.",

Trust also grows when participation is practical for real lives: reliable local offices, well-trained nonpartisan staff, disability access, and multilingual communication (including Spanish and Asian/Pacific Island languages) through schools, community centers, faith communities, and workplaces.
