    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and verify how decisions are made\u2014and when the rules apply fairly to everyone. We should set clear, consistent standards for integrity across agencies (open records by default, plain-language explanations, published performance metrics, and independent audits or inspections), while protecting legitimate privacy and security. Institutions should invite real public oversight through community advisory boards, accessible complaint and appeal processes, and regular public briefings that explain what went right, what went wrong, and what will change. Finally, rebuilding trust requires dependable service: well-trained, nonpartisan staff, strong safeguards against corruption and misinformation, and equitable access so every community can participate and hold leaders accountable.",

We should use voter-verified paper ballots (or an equivalent paper record) with secure chain-of-custody and routine, independent risk-limiting audits whose methods and results are explained in plain language. Keep rules clear and consistently applied, allow respectful public observation and bipartisan oversight, and communicate promptly and factually when problems arise and how they were fixed. Make participation practical and inclusive with well-staffed, accessible polling places, multilingual information, and simple step-by-step explanations through schools, libraries, and trusted local groups so families can follow the process and feel confident their voice is counted.",
