We should set straightforward, consistent standards for security and transparency (a voter-verifiable paper record or equivalent, strict chain-of-custody, routine independent audits, and strong privacy and cybersecurity protections) while keeping administration locally accountable and open to bipartisan and public observation. At the same time, we should expand practical access\u2014well-trained staff, accessible polling places, reasonable early and mail options with safeguards, and multilingual, plain-language guidance\u2014so eligible voters can participate without confusion or hardship. Finally, institutions should publish timely, easy-to-read explanations of procedures and audit findings, respond quickly to credible concerns, and invest in ongoing civic education and community partnerships to reduce misinformation and rebuild confidence over time.",

We should use voter-verifiable paper ballots (or paper backups where technology is used), maintain strict chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity, and conduct routine, nonpartisan risk-limiting audits after every election, with methods and results published in plain language for the public to review.

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on measures that people of different backgrounds can see, understand, and verify for themselves. That means clear, consistent rules; strong privacy protections; and transparent, locally visible processes backed by independent oversight. In practice, this includes voter-verified paper records (or equally verifiable equivalents), secure chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine post-election risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language, and meaningful opportunities for bipartisan and community observation without intimidation. Trust also grows when participation is practical for everyone: accessible polling places, accommodations for disabilities, language access, and secure, convenient options such as early voting and mail voting with safeguards. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education and rapid, nonpartisan myth-busting\u2014through schools, community organizations, and trusted local messengers\u2014so people know what protections exist, how to report problems, and how accountability works when something goes wrong.",
