    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and concerns are handled openly. A practical middle ground is to set clear, nonpartisan standards that apply everywhere: reliable, auditable voting records (typically paper-backed), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine post-election audits with results published in plain language. Institutions should pair these safeguards with consistent, timely communication\u2014explaining what is known, what is still being checked, and how to report problems\u2014while welcoming public observation and independent oversight that represents the full community. Finally, investing in ongoing civic education and multilingual, accessible information through trusted local partners can reduce misinformation and help every eligible voter understand and verify how decisions are made.",

That means using secure, auditable voting systems (such as voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent paper records), routine independent risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and nonpartisan oversight with clear standards applied consistently. Just as important, institutions must communicate in plain language and multiple languages, publish timely and transparent results and audit findings, and invite public observation in accessible ways. Trust grows when people can understand how decisions are made, confirm that safeguards work, report concerns without fear, and know that access\u2014across communities, disabilities, and languages\u2014is protected while integrity checks are rigorous and evidence-based.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make key decisions and results easy for ordinary people to verify, and ensure rules are applied fairly to every community. That means investing in secure, auditable systems (such as voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent auditable records), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine independent post-election audits, and clear public standards for how votes are counted, challenged, and certified. Trust also grows when oversight is truly nonpartisan, when problems are acknowledged and corrected transparently, and when the public can observe the process in respectful, accessible ways.\n\nJust as important, institutions must communicate better: provide plain-language explanations, publish timely evidence and audit findings, and offer multilingual, disability-accessible information through trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, community organizations, workplaces, and healthcare settings\u2014so families can understand what\u2019s happening without needing insider knowledge. Finally, we should counter misinformation with rapid, factual updates and consistent media and official messaging that explains the process rather than inflaming conflict. When people can see how decisions are made, verify the safeguards, and access services without barriers, confidence in our institutions increases.",
