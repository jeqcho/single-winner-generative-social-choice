We should set clear, consistent standards for transparency and accountability: auditable voting records (such as voter-verified paper trails), routine independent post-election audits with publicly posted methods and results, and strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections. At the same time, institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, provide accessible options for seniors, disabled voters, and working families, and create safe, well-staffed sites with reasonable identification or verification processes that protect both integrity and equal access. Finally, rebuild trust through community-facing oversight\u2014bipartisan/nonpartisan observers, open data where appropriate, and partnerships with schools, libraries, and local organizations\u2014so neighbors can understand, witness, and verify how decisions are made.",
