Institutions should commit to radical clarity\u2014plain-language explanations of rules, budgets, and outcomes\u2014paired with independent oversight, open data where privacy allows, and regular public audits that explain what worked, what didn\u2019t, and what will change. At the same time, services must be reliable and accessible: clear customer-service standards, timely responses to complaints, consistent enforcement of rules, and genuine opportunities for community input through local forums, citizen advisory panels, and participatory budgeting. Trust is earned when institutions are competent, nonpartisan in their administration of shared rules, accountable for mistakes, and respectful of people across political and cultural lines.",

We should adopt clear, consistently applied standards with local accountability: voter-verified paper records, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results published in plain language for the public to review. At the same time, access must be practical and non-discriminatory\u2014well-staffed, accessible polling places; reasonable early voting and secure mail or drop-off options; and clear, multilingual information\u2014so participation is feasible for working families, seniors, and people with disabilities. Finally, institutions should invest in nonpartisan civic education and timely, transparent communication through trusted community partners (schools, libraries, community centers, and faith organizations) to answer questions, counter misinformation with facts, and show how accountability works in practice.",
