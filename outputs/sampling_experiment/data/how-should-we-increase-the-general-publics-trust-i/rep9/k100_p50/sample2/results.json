    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that rules are fair, decisions are evidence-based, and leaders are accountable to the public\u2014not to party, money, or insiders. We should require clear standards for transparency (plain-language explanations of how decisions are made), independent oversight (regular audits, inspectors general, and open data where privacy allows), and meaningful public participation (accessible hearings, community advisory boards, and responsive complaint processes). Institutions should deliver services competently and consistently across communities, protect personal privacy, enforce ethics rules with real consequences, and correct mistakes publicly and quickly. Finally, investing in civic education and trusted local messengers can reduce misinformation and help residents understand what institutions do, how to verify claims, and how to get problems fixed.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can see, understand, and independently verify that the rules are fair and every eligible vote is counted accurately. We should standardize voter-verified paper ballots (or paper-backed records) with clear chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight\u2014while publishing timely, plain-language results reports and audit explanations that the public and media can review. At the same time, elections must be accessible: safe, well-staffed polling places; practical options like early voting and secure mail voting where used; and clear multilingual, ADA-compliant information so working families, seniors, and disabled voters can participate confidently. By investing in local election infrastructure, poll worker training, transparent observation, and consistent fact-based communication that counters misinformation without partisan spin, we can demonstrate integrity in practice and rebuild confidence in our institutions.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the rules and results easy for ordinary people to see, understand, and verify. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration with consistent standards; voter\u2011verified paper records (or equally verifiable backups), strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity, and routine independent audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) with findings published in plain language and open data where appropriate. Trust also depends on fair access: safe and well\u2011staffed polling places, reliable early and mail options with clear safeguards, and strong disability and language access so English and Spanish speakers\u2014and other communities\u2014can participate without confusion or barriers. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, community groups and faith communities), invite public observation and questions, and respond quickly and transparently to problems so people across parties and backgrounds can see accountability in action.",
