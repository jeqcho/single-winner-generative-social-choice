    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, how mistakes are found, and how leaders are held accountable\u2014without needing to share a political identity to believe the evidence. We should set clear, consistent public standards for integrity (independent audits and inspections, open data where privacy allows, strong conflict-of-interest rules, and transparent procurement), and pair them with simple, plain-language explanations that show what the institution did, why it did it, and what would change if it fell short. At the same time, institutions must earn trust through everyday competence and fairness: reliable service, respectful treatment, accessible and multilingual communication, strong privacy and cybersecurity protections, and easy ways for residents to ask questions, observe key processes, and appeal decisions. Finally, we should reduce misinformation and polarization by publishing timely, verifiable facts, inviting credible cross-partisan and community oversight, and measuring performance publicly\u2014so confidence is built on transparent proof and real-world results rather than slogans.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the work of government easier for ordinary people to see, understand, and verify. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration with consistent rules; voter-verified paper records (or an equally auditable paper trail), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results explained in plain language. Trust also grows when participation is genuinely accessible: safe and well-staffed polling places, reasonable options like early and mail voting with clear safeguards, and strong accommodations for disability and language access\u2014Spanish and Asian/Pacific Island languages included\u2014so every eligible voter can take part without confusion or fear. Finally, institutions should communicate early and honestly when problems occur, invite public observation and community volunteers, partner with schools, libraries, faith groups, and local organizations for civics education, and counter misinformation with timely, factual updates. When people can verify outcomes themselves and feel respected by a system that works reliably in every neighborhood, confidence in our institutions rises.",
