    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and get clear answers when problems occur. A practical middle ground is to strengthen transparency and accountability (publicly posted standards, independent oversight and routine audits, open data where privacy allows, and real consequences for misconduct) while also improving everyday service (reliable staffing and funding, shorter wait times, accessible offices, and respectful treatment for every community). Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, explain what safeguards exist and what uncertainties remain, and correct mistakes quickly and publicly. Finally, inviting community participation\u2014citizen advisory panels, volunteer roles, and partnerships with schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations\u2014can help people experience the process firsthand, reducing misinformation and increasing confidence that institutions work for everyone.",

We should set clear, consistently applied standards and fund professional, nonpartisan administration that prioritizes security, privacy, and equal access. Practical steps include voter-verifiable paper ballots (or equivalent auditable paper records), strong chain-of-custody, routine independent risk-limiting audits with publicly posted methods and results, and robust cybersecurity and testing. Trust also requires transparent, plain-language communication\u2014delivered through local partners like schools, libraries, and community groups and available in multiple languages and accessible formats\u2014so voters know how ballots are cast, counted, and certified, and how issues are corrected. By pairing strong, evidence-based safeguards with welcoming, convenient voting options and respectful treatment of voters and election workers, institutions can earn confidence across political and cultural differences.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the work of government easy to verify, easy to understand, and fair to everyone. That means clear, consistent rules; secure systems that protect privacy; and results that can be independently checked through auditable records (such as voter-verified paper trails) and routine, nonpartisan post-election audits with publicly posted methods and findings. Trust also depends on access and respect: well-trained and protected frontline staff, reasonable wait times, reliable local administration with stable funding, and voting information that is plain-language, disability-accessible, and available in the languages communities use at home. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often\u2014explaining what safeguards exist, how problems are corrected, and why outcomes are legitimate\u2014while partnering with trusted local leaders (schools, libraries, faith and community groups) to strengthen civics education and reduce misinformation. When people can see the rules, see the checks, and see that everyone is treated equally, confidence grows.",
