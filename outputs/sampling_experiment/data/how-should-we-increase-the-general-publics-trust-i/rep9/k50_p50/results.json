    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify outcomes, and experience fair treatment in everyday interactions. We should set clear, consistently applied standards for transparency (plain-language explanations, open data where privacy allows, and public reporting of performance), accountability (independent oversight, regular audits, and real consequences for misconduct), and participation (easy, multilingual, ADA-accessible ways for the public to ask questions, give input, and observe key processes). Institutions should also invest in frontline service\u2014timely responses, respectful staff training, and community partnerships\u2014so trust is built not only through policies, but through reliable, humane experiences. Finally, we should counter misinformation with rapid, nonpartisan communication that corrects errors with evidence, while protecting civil liberties and avoiding unnecessary barriers that make people feel excluded.",

Trust also depends on equal, practical access: well\u2011staffed and ADA\u2011compliant polling places, reasonable early and mail voting options, and multilingual information so working families, seniors, and immigrant communities can participate confidently. Finally, institutions should communicate proactively through trusted local partners\u2014schools, libraries, community and faith groups\u2014invite public observation and volunteer service, and respond quickly and transparently to problems and misinformation. When safeguards are evidence\u2011based, visible, and inclusive, confidence rises because accountability is real and every eligible voice is respected.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy to verify, clearly explained, and fair for every community. That means setting transparent, consistently applied rules; using auditable records (such as paper trails where appropriate); conducting routine independent audits with publicly shareable findings; and protecting privacy and security with strong cybersecurity and clear chain-of-custody practices. Trust also grows when participation is practical for real lives: accessible locations, ADA compliance, reasonable early and mail options, shorter lines, and multilingual information so families\u2014including Spanish-speaking and Tribal communities\u2014can understand and use the system without confusion. Finally, institutions should communicate in plain language, publish data and timelines, invite respectful public observation and community feedback, and invest in ongoing civic education through schools and trusted local partners, so accountability is visible and confidence is built through evidence rather than politics.",
