We should standardize a few core safeguards nationwide while preserving local administration: voter-verified paper records (or paper backups), strong chain-of-custody, routine public post-election audits, and open observation by bipartisan teams and nonpartisan community members. Institutions must communicate in plain, multilingual language, publish easy-to-check data about processes and results, quickly correct mistakes, and explain how concerns are investigated. At the same time, access should be reliable and nondiscriminatory\u2014reasonable options for in-person, early, and mail voting; well-trained staff; and accommodations for disability and language needs\u2014so eligible voters can participate without confusion or fear. When the system is both secure and welcoming, and when officials are transparent about what works and what needs fixing, confidence can rebuild across communities.",
