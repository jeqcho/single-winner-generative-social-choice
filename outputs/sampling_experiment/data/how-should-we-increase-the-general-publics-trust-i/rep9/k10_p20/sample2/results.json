    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, check that rules are applied fairly, and experience services that work consistently in their daily lives. Institutions should publish clear, plain-language explanations of goals, authority, and results; release understandable data and independent evaluations; and create regular opportunities for community members\u2014including skeptics\u2014to observe, ask questions, and participate through advisory panels, public audits, and open meetings. Strong ethics rules, conflict-of-interest disclosure, and real consequences for misconduct should be paired with practical improvements like shorter wait times, accessible and multilingual information, and privacy protections for the public. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and honestly about mistakes, correct them transparently, and partner with trusted local organizations to counter misinformation with evidence rather than politics.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in our elections\u2014and in the institutions that run them\u2014grows when the rules are clear, the work is nonpartisan, and the results are independently verifiable. We should use secure, auditable voting systems with voter-verifiable paper records, strong cybersecurity, and documented chain-of-custody, followed by routine risk-limiting, publicly reported audits and prompt correction of any errors. Election administration should be professionally staffed and insulated from partisan pressure, with bipartisan oversight and opportunities for community observers and volunteers so neighbors can see the process up close. Finally, institutions must communicate early and often in plain language\u2014through trusted local partners\u2014and provide accessible, multilingual information and voting options (including disability accommodations, adequate polling places, and early/mail options) so every eligible voter can participate with confidence that outcomes reflect the evidence and the will of the people.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should make decisions and results easier for everyday people to verify, and ensure services feel fair and respectful across communities. That means clear, consistent rules; strong security and privacy protections; independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with publicly available audits; and straightforward, plain-language explanations of what was done, why, and what the evidence shows\u2014shared in accessible formats and multiple languages where needed. Trust also grows when institutions deliver reliably in people\u2019s daily lives: timely responses, transparent budgeting and performance measures, open meetings and records, and real accountability when mistakes happen. Partnering with trusted local organizations (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups), expanding opportunities for community members to observe and participate, and investing in civic education and media literacy can help counter misinformation and rebuild confidence that institutions work for everyone.",
