    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability, regardless of party or viewpoint. We should use verifiable systems (such as auditable paper records where appropriate), routine independent post\u2011process audits with publicly posted results, and strong protections against tampering or interference, alongside strict transparency about what went right, what went wrong, and how issues were fixed. At the same time, access should be practical for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and language-minority communities through well-funded service, clear multilingual information, and multiple secure ways to participate. Finally, institutions should communicate in plain language, correct false claims quickly with evidence, protect frontline staff from threats, and invite community observation and feedback so trust is earned through openness, competence, and fair treatment for everyone.",

We should use simple, auditable safeguards (verifiable paper ballots or equivalent auditable records, strict chain-of-custody, robust cybersecurity, and routine risk-limiting post\u2011election audits) with nonpartisan, bipartisan, and independent oversight, and publish timely, plain-language audit results and incident reports. Trust also depends on equal, practical access: well-funded polling places, safe early and mail options, disability accommodations, and clear multilingual voter information so every eligible voter can participate without confusion or undue barriers. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing, nonpartisan civic education and rapid, fact-based responses to misinformation\u2014working with trusted local partners like schools, libraries, and community organizations\u2014so accountability is visible, participation is welcomed, and confidence can be earned over time.",

That means nonpartisan administration; secure, auditable systems (including paper records where possible); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine, independent post\u2011process audits with results published quickly in plain language. Trust also depends on fair access: well-funded polling locations with reasonable wait times, flexible options like early and mail voting where allowed, and clear voter information in the languages communities use. Finally, institutions should communicate openly about problems and fixes, protect frontline workers from intimidation, and invest in practical civics education and community outreach (schools, libraries, veterans\u2019 groups, and local organizations) so misinformation loses power and people feel respected, included, and confident that the process is both secure and fair.",
