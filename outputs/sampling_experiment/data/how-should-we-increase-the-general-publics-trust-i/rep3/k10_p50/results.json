Trust also depends on equal access: information in the languages people use, disability accommodations, and voting options that fit different work and family schedules, while maintaining sensible security and chain-of-custody standards. Finally, institutions should partner with trusted local groups\u2014schools, libraries, community organizations, and faith communities\u2014to provide nonpartisan civic education and rapid, factual responses to misinformation, so people don\u2019t have to \u201ctake it on faith\u201d that the system is fair.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few simple, widely shared expectations: clear rules, visible accountability, equal treatment, and communication people can actually use. That means nonpartisan administration with consistent standards, secure and auditable records (including paper backups where appropriate), routine independent audits with publicly posted results, strong cybersecurity, and strict chain-of-custody so outcomes can be verified without relying on anyone\u2019s word. Trust also grows when participation is practical for real life\u2014well-staffed polling places, reasonable wait times, accessible sites and ballots for seniors and people with disabilities, and accurate voter information in plain language and the languages communities speak (including Spanish). Finally, institutions should correct mistakes openly, protect frontline workers from threats, and partner with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, community groups, and veterans\u2019 organizations\u2014to teach civics and counter misinformation with facts. When people can see how decisions are made, check the receipts, and be treated with respect, confidence can grow across generations and communities.",
