    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, based on evidence, and with clear accountability\u2014especially at the local level where impacts are felt. Institutions should publish plain-language explanations of how key decisions are made, what data and standards were used, who is responsible, and how the public can verify performance through independent audits and open records that protect privacy. Access and treatment must be equitable: services and information should be available in multiple languages and formats, with simple ways to report problems and receive timely, transparent responses. Leaders should commit to consistent rules, disclose conflicts of interest, enforce consequences for misconduct, and invite cross-partisan and community oversight so disagreement is expected but the process remains trustworthy. When institutions communicate candidly about mistakes, correct them publicly, and measure outcomes over time, confidence can be rebuilt without asking anyone to take trust on faith.",

Administration should stay locally accountable while meeting consistent, public standards for security and fairness, backed by strong cybersecurity and protections for election workers.\n\nAt the same time, institutions should earn confidence through respectful, factual communication: prompt disclosure of problems and fixes, open observation opportunities that protect voter privacy, and clear multilingual and disability\u2011accessible information so people don\u2019t have to rely on rumors. When people can see how decisions are made, how errors are caught, and how outcomes are proven\u2014while voting remains accessible and secure\u2014trust becomes easier to sustain even when we disagree about politics.",

Finally, we should invest in civic education and media literacy through schools, libraries, faith and community groups, and strengthen protections for public workers so they can do their jobs without political pressure.
