    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, based on evidence, and with real consequences for mistakes. Institutions should publish clear, plain-language explanations of how key decisions are made, share performance metrics and budgets in accessible formats, and invite independent audits and community observers so the public can verify claims rather than rely on slogans. At the same time, accountability must be practical and nonpartisan: strong ethics rules, transparent conflict-of-interest disclosures, consistent enforcement, and protections for whistleblowers and frontline workers. Trust also requires equal, respectful access\u2014services that work for rural and urban communities alike, multilingual and disability-friendly communication, and predictable channels for complaints and appeals. When institutions communicate early about problems, correct errors openly, and demonstrate measurable improvement over time, people across viewpoints are more willing to believe the system is working for them.",

We should make key public processes\u2014especially elections\u2014transparent and verifiable: use voter\u2011verifiable paper ballots (or paper backups), maintain strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody, and conduct routine, independent post\u2011process audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) with plain\u2011language public reports of what was checked and what was found. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and bipartisan, with safe opportunities for credentialed observers and community members to watch without compromising privacy. At the same time, institutions should serve everyone by providing accessible options (early voting, secure mail voting where offered, well\u2011staffed polling places), multilingual and disability\u2011friendly information, and timely, fact\u2011based communication that addresses problems openly and corrects misinformation without dismissing good\u2011faith concerns. When institutions consistently show their work, admit and fix mistakes, and treat every community with respect, trust can be earned and maintained.",
