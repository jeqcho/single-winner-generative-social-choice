    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, competently, and without favoritism. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, verifiable safeguards with clear public transparency: use voting systems with auditable records (including paper backups where feasible), conduct routine independent post-election audits with publicly posted methods and results, and enforce strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards. At the same time, expand access and understanding by offering predictable voting options, disability-friendly polling places, and multilingual, plain-language explanations of registration, voting, counting, and recounts. Institutions should welcome bipartisan and community observers, publish performance metrics and error-correction processes, and respond to concerns with facts and respectful dialogue\u2014so people don\u2019t have to rely on partisan voices to know the system is working.",

We should use voting systems with a voter-verified paper record, conduct routine independent risk-limiting audits, enforce strict chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity, and provide bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight that protects election workers from political pressure. Just as important, officials should communicate clearly and proactively\u2014using plain language, multilingual materials (including Spanish), and accessible formats for people with disabilities\u2014so voters know how ballots are cast, counted, and checked. By pairing verifiable safeguards with equal access (early voting, mail options where available, and barrier-free polling places) and consistent fact-based responses to misinformation and legitimate questions, we can build confidence across communities and political viewpoints.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on things people can see, check, and access. That means clear, consistent rules; secure and auditable systems (paper ballots or paper backups where machines are used); routine independent post-election audits (like risk-limiting audits); strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections; and transparent public reporting that explains what happened and why. Trust also depends on equal access: convenient voting options (early voting, mail or drop-off where allowed), barrier-free polling places for people with disabilities, and accurate information in plain language and multiple languages (including Spanish and other community languages). Finally, institutions should invite bipartisan and community observation, respond to concerns with documented facts (not insults), and enforce strong ethics and accountability for officials\u2014so people across backgrounds and political views can verify the process and feel that it is fair, secure, and respectful to everyone.",
