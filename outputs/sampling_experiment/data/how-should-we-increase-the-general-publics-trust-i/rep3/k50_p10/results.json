We should use voting systems with voter-verifiable paper records, conduct routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits), and enforce strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards. Election administration should be professional and nonpartisan, with meaningful bipartisan and community oversight and protection for election workers from political pressure. Just as important, officials should communicate in plain language and multiple languages (including Spanish), using clear explanations and practical examples of how registration, voting, counting, and verification work, while expanding access for eligible voters\u2014early voting, vote-by-mail where appropriate, and barrier-free options for people with disabilities. By pairing transparent safeguards with respectful, fact-based public education and open reporting, we can reduce misinformation, address legitimate questions, and strengthen confidence that every eligible vote is counted accurately.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few practical commitments that people across backgrounds can see and verify: clear, consistent rules; secure, auditable systems; equal access; and honest communication. That means using voting methods with a paper record (or equally verifiable audit trails), conducting routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits), enforcing strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and making key procedures and results easy to inspect through bipartisan and community oversight. Trust also depends on making participation straightforward and fair\u2014safe polling places, reasonable early and mail options where allowed, accessible voting for people with disabilities, and accurate multilingual information (including Spanish and other common household languages) so no family is left guessing how registration, voting, counting, and recounts work. Finally, institutions should address misinformation with transparent facts and concrete evidence\u2014without insulting people\u2019s concerns\u2014by publishing plain-language explanations, local demonstrations, and regular public Q&A. When people can both participate easily and verify outcomes, trust becomes something we earn through openness and accountability, not something we demand.",
