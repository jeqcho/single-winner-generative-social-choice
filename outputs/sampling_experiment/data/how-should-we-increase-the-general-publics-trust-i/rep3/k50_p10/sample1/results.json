    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections can grow when the system is easy to understand, hard to manipulate, and fair to every eligible voter. A workable middle ground is to use voter-verifiable paper ballots (or paper backups), clear chain-of-custody procedures, and routine post-election audits that are nonpartisan, publicly reported, and open to meaningful observation without disrupting the process. Election offices should communicate in plain language\u2014before and after Election Day\u2014about how ballots are protected, how audits confirm results, and how problems are handled, while also providing accessible voting options (early, mail, and in-person) with well-staffed, disability-accessible polling places and language support where needed. Finally, consistent baseline standards and adequate funding for local election officials, paired with responsible public messaging from leaders who respect verified outcomes, can reduce misinformation and help people across communities feel confident their vote is counted as cast.",

Election offices should be well-funded and independently overseen, with strong cybersecurity, consistent rules, and clear explanations of how ballots are protected and how problems are handled. At the same time, voting should remain accessible\u2014through adequately staffed polling places, reasonable hours, and secure early and mail options\u2014along with voter information in the languages communities use.

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the general public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few clear principles people across backgrounds can verify for themselves: fairness, transparency, accountability, and equal access. That means keeping core processes simple and auditable (paper ballots or voter-verifiable records, secure chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine post-election audits with publicly posted results), and ensuring administration is nonpartisan with meaningful oversight from multiple parties and independent reviewers. Trust also grows when institutions communicate early and often in plain language, publish clear timelines and explanations when problems occur, and make information accessible in the languages people use at home. Finally, institutions should make participation practical for working families and seniors\u2014well-staffed polling places, reasonable lines, early and mail options with secure tracking\u2014while investing in ongoing civics education and community partnerships (schools, libraries, local groups) that help people see how decisions are made and how they can hold officials accountable.",
