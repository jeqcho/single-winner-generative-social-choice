    "new_statement": "Trust in elections\u2014and in institutions generally\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability. A practical middle-ground agenda is to combine strong, verifiable safeguards (voter-verifiable paper records, routine independent post-election audits, secure chain-of-custody, and modern cybersecurity) with straightforward access for eligible voters (reliable early and Election Day options, clear registration procedures, accessible polling places, and accurate multilingual information). Administration should be locally grounded but insulated from partisan pressure through transparent standards, bipartisan or cross-partisan oversight, and public reporting that explains what happened, what went wrong, and how it was fixed. Finally, ongoing civics education and partnerships with trusted community organizations can help counter misinformation by replacing rumors with plain-language, checkable facts.",

Administration should be nonpartisan and transparent, with bipartisan or cross-partisan oversight, open communication about problems and fixes, and consistent standards that protect election workers from political pressure.\n\nFinally, institutions should invest in ongoing civics education and community outreach through trusted local partners to explain how decisions are made, how safeguards work, and how misinformation is corrected\u2014so accountability is visible, participation is respected, and confidence can be earned over time.",
