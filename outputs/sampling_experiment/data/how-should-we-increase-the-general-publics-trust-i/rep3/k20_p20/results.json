    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014rises when people can see clear rules, real accountability, and fair treatment regardless of party or background. We can move toward that by adopting verifiable, easy-to-explain systems (such as voter-verifiable paper records where possible), routine independent audits with public summaries, strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections, and transparent reporting when problems occur and how they are fixed. At the same time, access should be practical for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, rural voters, and multilingual communities, with consistent information that is plain-language and widely available. The goal is a process that is both secure and welcoming: tough on fraud and interference, tough on intimidation, and open enough that an ordinary person can understand and confirm how decisions were made.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make processes transparent, verifiable, and easy for everyday people to understand, while keeping participation fair and accessible. That means voter\u2011verifiable paper ballots (or paper backups), routine independent post\u2011election audits such as risk\u2011limiting audits, strong cybersecurity and clear chain\u2011of\u2011custody rules, and nonpartisan/bipartisan oversight with publicly reported results in plain language. At the same time, institutions should provide clear, timely, multilingual information; practical voting options (like early voting and well-run absentee or vote\u2011by\u2011mail where used); and accessible polling and ballot design for seniors, people with disabilities, and working families. Finally, consistent civics education and community outreach through trusted local partners\u2014paired with prompt, fact\u2011based correction of misinformation and transparency about problems and fixes\u2014can rebuild confidence that rules are fair, accountability is real, and every eligible person\u2019s voice is counted.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few practical commitments that people across backgrounds can see working in real life: make decisions and results transparent, make systems verifiable, communicate clearly, and treat everyone fairly.\n\nThat means using voter-verifiable paper records (or paper backups), routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits), strong cybersecurity, and clear chain-of-custody rules that are publicly documented. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan\u2014bipartisan where appropriate, with independent reviewers\u2014and local administrators should be protected from political pressure so rules are applied consistently.\n\nTrust also depends on whether people can understand and access the process. Institutions should provide timely, plain-language explanations of what happened and why, publish easy-to-read data and audit results, and offer accurate multilingual information and assistance. Voting (and other public services) should be convenient and accessible for working people, seniors, people with disabilities, and immigrant communities\u2014without weakening verification.\n\nFinally, institutions should be honest about mistakes: acknowledge problems early, show the fix, and let independent checks confirm it. Pair that with ongoing civics education and community outreach through trusted local organizations, so misinformation has less room to grow and people feel respected, heard, and confident that the same rules apply to everyone.",
