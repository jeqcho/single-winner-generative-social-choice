    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are followed, and experience fair, respectful service in their daily lives. A practical middle ground is to pair transparency and accountability with accessibility: publish clear standards and plain-language explanations of decisions; open data and records by default while protecting privacy; use independent, nonpartisan oversight (including regular audits and public reporting); enforce strong ethics rules, conflict-of-interest limits, and real consequences for misconduct; and create easy ways for the public to ask questions, appeal decisions, and get timely answers in multiple languages. Institutions should also invest in frontline capacity\u2014staffing, training, cybersecurity, and modern systems\u2014so services are reliable and consistent across communities. When outcomes are measurable, processes are visible, and people feel heard and treated equally, trust can grow without demanding blind faith in any party or leader.",

That means transparent, consistent rules; secure, auditable records (such as voter-verifiable paper trails); routine, publicly reported independent audits; and strong protections against intimidation, corruption, and cyber disruptions.
