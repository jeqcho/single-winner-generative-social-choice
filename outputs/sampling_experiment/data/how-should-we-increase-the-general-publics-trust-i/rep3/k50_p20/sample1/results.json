    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and challenge how decisions are made\u2014and when the rules are applied consistently to everyone. A practical middle ground is to set clear public standards for transparency (plain-language explanations, open meetings, and published data), accountability (independent audits, enforceable ethics rules, and real consequences for misconduct), and fairness (equal access to services and responsive complaint processes). Institutions should invite regular public observation and participation\u2014through citizen advisory panels, community partnerships, and multilingual, disability-accessible communication\u2014while protecting privacy and security where needed. If leaders communicate openly about mistakes, fix them quickly, and measure performance against shared benchmarks, trust can be earned across political and cultural lines.",

That means clear, consistent rules; secure systems with a paper record; routine independent, publicly reported audits (such as risk-limiting audits); and transparent reporting when problems occur and how they\u2019re fixed. Trust also grows when administration is nonpartisan and accountable, with bipartisan and community oversight where appropriate. Finally, institutions should make participation straightforward and fair for everyone by providing plain-language, multilingual and disability-accessible information, convenient and well-run service options, and strong nonpartisan civics education and outreach that counters misinformation without partisan spin.",

That means setting clear, consistent rules; publishing plain-language explanations of what the institution does and why; opening up data and records where privacy allows; and using independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with routine audits whose findings are reported publicly and promptly. Institutions should communicate early and honestly about problems, mistakes, and fixes; enforce strong ethics rules and real consequences for misconduct; and deliver services that are accessible and fair\u2014through convenient hours, disability accommodations, multilingual support, and local, community-based outreach.
