At the same time, we should make it practical for every eligible person to vote by providing accessible polling places and hours, safe early and mail options where offered, multilingual information, and reasonable identity and eligibility checks paired with free, simple ways to obtain needed documents and accommodations for disabilities. Finally, election offices should receive stable funding, cybersecurity support, and a commitment to rapid, factual communication about problems and fixes, so the public sees both competence and accountability\u2014and can trust outcomes even when their preferred candidates lose.",

We should use paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records everywhere, maintain strict chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity, and conduct routine post-election risk-limiting audits with publicly posted methods and findings, reviewed by independent, bipartisan observers. Voting should also be accessible to every eligible voter through consistent rules, well-run polling places, reasonable accommodations for disabilities and long work hours, and clear multilingual information.

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the results verifiable, and the experience accessible, without favoring any party. That means using auditable paper records (or voter-verifiable paper trails), enforcing strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and conducting routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with transparent public reporting. It also means consistent, well-trained, adequately funded local administration and bipartisan/independent oversight so people can see that safeguards are real and applied equally.\n\nAt the same time, participation must be practical for working families, seniors, rural voters, and people with disabilities: clear registration, convenient polling options (including early and well-secured mail voting where used), reasonable identity and eligibility checks paired with free, easy ways to comply, and language access with plain-language materials and community outreach through trusted local organizations. Finally, officials should communicate quickly and honestly about what happened, what problems arose, and how they were fixed\u2014so people don\u2019t have to rely on rumors to understand outcomes.",
