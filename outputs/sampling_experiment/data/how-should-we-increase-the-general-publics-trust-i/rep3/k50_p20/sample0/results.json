We should use paper-based records (or voter-verifiable paper trails), strict chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and transparent public reporting so results can be independently confirmed without exposing how any individual voted. At the same time, participation must be practical for all eligible voters: well-staffed polling places with flexible options (in-person, early, and secure mail where used), accessible sites and ballots for people with disabilities, and language assistance where needed. Communities should be able to observe the process through bipartisan oversight and trained nonpartisan observers, with clear privacy safeguards. Finally, election officials and civic leaders should communicate quickly and plainly about procedures, problems, and fixes, and support ongoing civic education and rapid fact-checking so misinformation is addressed with shared, verifiable facts rather than partisan spin.",
