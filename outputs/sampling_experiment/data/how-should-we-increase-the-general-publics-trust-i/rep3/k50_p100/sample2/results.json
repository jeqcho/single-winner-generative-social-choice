    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are made by clear rules, checked by independent reviewers, and corrected openly when something goes wrong. We should set simple, consistent standards for integrity (strong records, clear chain-of-custody for critical processes, regular third\u2011party audits, and public reporting of results and errors) while keeping services accessible and fair through multilingual communication, disability accommodations, and convenient ways for people to participate. Institutions should publish plain-language explanations of how key decisions are reached, share data in privacy\u2011protecting ways, and invite bipartisan and community oversight so accountability is local and visible, not partisan. Finally, leaders and media should commit to evidence-based corrections and consequences for misconduct, so trust is earned through transparency, competence, and equal treatment\u2014not slogans.",

We should prioritize simple, verifiable safeguards such as paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), strict chain-of-custody, and routine, independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits) with clear public reporting of what was checked and what was found. Oversight should be truly nonpartisan and transparent, with bipartisan observers and open processes that protect voter privacy while allowing communities to see how results are secured and verified. At the same time, institutions should communicate in plain language, correct misinformation with documented facts, and ensure lawful access is practical for working people and diverse communities through well-run polling places, clear instructions, and language and disability accommodations. When security, transparency, and accessibility are treated as shared standards\u2014not partisan weapons\u2014more citizens can accept outcomes with confidence, even when their preferred side loses.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when everyday people can see clear rules, fair treatment, and real accountability\u2014no matter who is in charge. We can rebuild confidence by making decisions and services more transparent (plain-language explanations, multilingual access, and open data), more verifiable (independent audits, clear performance metrics, and public reporting of mistakes and fixes), and more responsive (simple ways to file complaints, get timely answers, and see problems corrected). Institutions should be protected from partisan pressure through consistent standards, ethical safeguards, and oversight that includes people from different political views and community backgrounds. Finally, trust rises when institutions meet people where they are\u2014through schools, libraries, workplaces, faith and community groups\u2014and invest in civic education and media literacy so residents can separate facts from rumors. When institutions are understandable, accessible, and demonstrably accountable, confidence can be earned across communities even when people disagree on policy.",
