    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, based on evidence, and checked by independent watchdogs\u2014not by politics or insiders. We should set clear, consistent rules; publish plain-language explanations of how decisions are reached; and make underlying data, budgets, and performance measures easy to audit while protecting privacy and security. Institutions should invite meaningful public oversight through bipartisan or cross-community review panels, accessible public meetings, and transparent processes for reporting problems, investigating misconduct, and correcting mistakes. At the same time, leaders must communicate early and honestly about risks and tradeoffs, respond quickly to misinformation with verifiable facts, and ensure services are delivered reliably and equitably so every community experiences competence and respect. When accountability is real, information is understandable, and people can participate without barriers, trust can be earned and maintained over time.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can verify that decisions are made fairly, consistently, and transparently in their own communities. A strong approach is to use simple, auditable processes with clear chains of custody, routine independent risk-limiting audits, and plain-language public reporting of results and any problems found and fixed. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and locally accountable, with open observation rules that protect privacy and safety, and cybersecurity and record-keeping standards that prevent tampering and confusion. Trust also depends on equal, practical access: accessible polling places, reasonable options like early and mail voting where used, and multilingual, disability-friendly information so every eligible person can participate without barriers. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education and rapid, fact-based responses to misinformation, so people can understand the safeguards and judge claims by evidence rather than partisan spin.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when everyday people can see that the rules are fair, the work is competent, and the results can be independently verified. We should set clear, consistent standards while keeping administration accountable at the local level: voter-verifiable paper ballots (or an equivalent auditable paper record), strong chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits run by independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan teams, and public reporting of audit findings and any problems with straightforward explanations of what was fixed.\n\nTrust also depends on inclusion and respect. Institutions should make participation practical for working families and seniors through adequate staffing, safe polling places, reasonable hours and options (including early and secure mail voting where used), and accessible design for people with disabilities. Information should be timely, factual, and available in plain language and the languages communities speak, delivered through trusted local partners like schools, libraries, community groups, and faith organizations.\n\nFinally, leaders and platforms should address misinformation without dismissing legitimate questions: publish evidence, explain procedures calmly, protect election workers from intimidation, and invite lawful public observation so disagreements can be resolved with facts rather than rumors. When institutions are transparent, auditable, service-oriented, and accessible, people are more willing to accept outcomes\u2014even when they don\u2019t like them\u2014because they can verify the process is honest.",
