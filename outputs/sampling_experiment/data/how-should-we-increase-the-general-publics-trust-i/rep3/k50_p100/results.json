    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, competently, and with real accountability\u2014especially in high-stakes systems like elections. We should set clear, consistent rules; use voting methods that leave a voter-verifiable paper record; and require routine, independent audits that publish plain-language results and data that can be reviewed without compromising privacy. Institutions should communicate early and often about what happened, what went wrong (if anything), and how it was fixed, while protecting staff from intimidation and keeping oversight genuinely nonpartisan. At the same time, trust requires inclusion: accessible voting options, disability accommodations, and accurate multilingual information delivered through trusted local messengers like schools, libraries, and community organizations. When institutions are transparent, responsive to feedback, and willing to prove their work with evidence\u2014not slogans\u2014people are more likely to accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see clear, consistent rules being followed, and when outcomes are independently verifiable without making participation harder for eligible citizens. For elections, that means voter-verifiable paper ballots (or an auditable paper record), strict chain-of-custody from casting to certification, and routine, publicly reported risk-limiting audits conducted by independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan teams. Make transparency practical and observable: publish plain-language explanations of each step, share audit methods and results, release timely precinct-level data that protects privacy, and allow credentialed public observation of key processes. Pair strong security and cybersecurity standards with accessible voting options\u2014well-funded polling places, early voting, secure mail voting where used, disability accommodations, and multilingual materials\u2014so every community can participate confidently. Finally, invest in year-round civic education and rapid, fact-based corrections of misinformation, and protect election workers from intimidation so institutions earn trust through reliability, openness, and accountability.",

    "new_statement": "To strengthen the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on measures people can see, verify, and understand, regardless of party or background. That means clear, consistent rules; locally accountable administration with nonpartisan and bipartisan oversight; and voting systems with a voter-verifiable paper record (or equivalent auditable record), strong chain-of-custody, and routine independent post\u2011election audits whose results are published in plain language. Trust also grows when institutions communicate early, honestly, and transparently about problems and fixes, invest in cybersecurity and worker safety, and welcome lawful observation without compromising voter privacy.\n\nJust as important, institutions must be accessible and fair: convenient voting options where allowed (early voting, secure mail voting), disability accommodations, and accurate multilingual information so families who don\u2019t speak English at home can participate confidently. Finally, long-term trust requires sustained civic and media literacy efforts through schools, libraries, faith communities, and trusted local organizations\u2014so people can tell the difference between evidence and rumors, raise concerns constructively, and see that the system treats every eligible person\u2019s voice with equal respect.",
