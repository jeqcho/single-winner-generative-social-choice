    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that rules are fair, decisions are evidence-based, and leaders are accountable. We should require clear standards that are applied consistently, make key processes transparent and independently audited, and publish plain-language explanations of what was done, what went wrong, and how it was fixed. Institutions should actively engage local communities\u2014through public forums, accessible data, and multilingual communication\u2014while protecting privacy and safety for workers and the public. At the same time, strengthening ethics rules, reducing conflicts of interest, and enforcing consequences for misconduct can show that no one is above the rules. When institutions are open about their work, responsive to concerns, and demonstrably competent, people are more willing to trust outcomes even when they disagree with them.",

We should use simple, verifiable processes that ordinary residents can understand\u2014such as records that can be independently audited, strict chain-of-custody for key documents, routine risk-limiting audits, and timely, plain-language public reporting of what happened and why. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and locally accountable, with transparent standards that are applied consistently so no community feels the rules change midstream. Just as important, institutions should communicate early and often in accessible, multilingual formats, invite lawful public observation without compromising privacy or safety, protect workers from intimidation, and invest in civic and media literacy so misinformation doesn\u2019t fill information gaps. When security and accessibility are treated as complementary\u2014and verification is built in by design\u2014more people will accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should make how decisions are made as visible, fair, and verifiable as possible\u2014so people don\u2019t have to rely on rumors, insider language, or party cues. That means clear rules applied consistently, strong record-keeping and oversight that can be independently checked, and plain-language public reporting that explains what was done, why it was done, what went wrong (if anything), and how it was fixed.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions are easy to access and responsive: services and information should be understandable, multilingual when needed, disability-friendly, and available through trusted local channels (schools, libraries, community groups, and local media). Finally, we should invest in civic education and media literacy, protect employees and whistleblowers, and reduce conflicts of interest through transparent ethics standards\u2014so accountability is routine, not political, and people can see that institutions work for everyone.",
