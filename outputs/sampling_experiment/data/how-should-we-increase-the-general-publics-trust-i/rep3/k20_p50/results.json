Institutions should publish plain-language explanations of how key decisions are made, open up data and records when privacy and security allow, and use independent, bipartisan (or cross-partisan) audits and oversight with findings released publicly. They should respond quickly and transparently to mistakes or misconduct, protect whistleblowers, and enforce ethics rules consistently regardless of status or party. Trust also grows when services are accessible and respectful\u2014through multilingual communication, disability-friendly options, and reliable local points of contact\u2014so people feel institutions work for them. Finally, sustained civic education and partnerships with trusted community organizations can help counter misinformation without censorship by making accurate, verifiable information easy to find and understand.",

Finally, investing in civics and media literacy\u2014through schools and trusted community groups\u2014helps people evaluate claims, resist misinformation, and engage constructively. These steps don\u2019t favor any party or ideology; they make institutions worthy of confidence by making performance visible, verifiable, and fair.",
