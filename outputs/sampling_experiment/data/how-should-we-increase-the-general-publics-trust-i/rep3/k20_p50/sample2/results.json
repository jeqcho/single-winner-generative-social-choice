    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including election administration\u2014grows when people can see clear standards, consistent follow\u2011through, and real accountability. A durable middle ground is to make critical processes transparent and verifiable (for example, paper records where appropriate, routine independent audits, and publicly posted results and procedures in plain language), while also protecting privacy and security. Institutions should communicate early and often about what happened, what went wrong, and how it will be fixed, using accessible formats and multilingual information so working people, seniors, and new Americans can participate confidently. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and include community observers and independent experts, with strong safeguards against cyber threats and political interference. Finally, rebuilding trust requires investing in civic education and media literacy, and holding leaders and media figures accountable when they knowingly spread false claims that undermine confidence without evidence.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when the rules are clear, the process is easy to understand, and the results can be independently verified. We should use secure, auditable paper records (or voter-verifiable trails), protect chain of custody, and conduct routine, publicly reported risk-limiting audits with nonpartisan, bipartisan oversight so people can see the checks working. Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, share timely explanations of procedures and any problems that occur, and make key data and audit summaries accessible without compromising privacy or security. At the same time, participation must be barrier-free for eligible voters through well-run polling places and practical options like early and mail voting, with accommodations for seniors and people with disabilities. Finally, sustained civic education, media literacy, and partnerships with trusted local organizations\u2014schools, libraries, and community groups\u2014can help counter misinformation and rebuild confidence through transparency, fairness, and consistent accountability.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make decision-making transparent, verifiable, and easy for everyday people to understand. That means clear, consistent rules; secure systems with auditable paper records; routine independent post\u2011process audits (reported publicly in plain language); and strong cybersecurity and data protection. Institutions should communicate early and often about what happened, what went wrong (if anything), and how it was fixed\u2014without partisan spin.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions are accessible and respectful: information and services should be available in multiple languages (including Spanish) and in formats that work for seniors, people with disabilities, busy workers, and families. Partnering with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, community groups, and faith communities\u2014can help explain processes, reduce misinformation, and give people real ways to observe, ask questions, and hold leaders accountable.\n\nIn short: open the doors, show the evidence, protect fairness and access for everyone, and create consistent accountability so people can verify that institutions serve the public\u2014not politics.",
