    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and verify that rules are applied fairly to everyone. We should combine strong security (paper-based records or verifiable trails, chain-of-custody standards, robust cybersecurity, and routine risk-limiting audits with publicly posted methods and results) with broad access (convenient early and absentee options, well-run in-person voting, and accommodations for disabilities, language needs, and work schedules). Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and transparent, with bipartisan observers, independent review, clear conflict-of-interest rules, and open data that protects voter privacy. Finally, sustained civics education, plain-language communication, and rapid correction of misinformation\u2014led by trusted local officials and community partners\u2014can help people judge institutions by evidence rather than rumor, rebuilding confidence over time.",

That means clear, consistently enforced standards; nonpartisan administration with bipartisan/independent oversight; paper-based or otherwise verifiable records; and routine risk-limiting audits with timely public reporting in plain language. Trust also depends on accessibility and equal treatment, so voting options should be secure and convenient (e.g., early voting and mail options where appropriate), with reasonable identity and ballot-handling safeguards and accommodations for disabilities, language needs, and working families. Finally, sustained civic education, transparent communication from officials, and rapid, evidence-based responses to misinformation can help people see the safeguards in action and feel confident that outcomes reflect the will of eligible voters.",
