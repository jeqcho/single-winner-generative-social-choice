    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections increases when institutions consistently show their work: clear, secure rules; transparent procedures that ordinary people can observe and understand; and independent checks that confirm results. A strong middle-ground approach is to use auditable paper records (or voter-verifiable paper trails), enforce strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and conduct routine risk-limiting audits with public reporting\u2014while keeping voting accessible through practical options like early voting, mail voting where appropriate, and accommodations for people with disabilities or language barriers. Just as important, election offices should communicate in plain, nonpartisan language before, during, and after Election Day\u2014explaining how ballots are verified, counted, and recounted\u2014and partner with trusted local civic groups to provide voter education and counter misinformation with evidence, not rhetoric. When integrity protections and voter access are treated as complementary goals, and oversight is bipartisan and independent, confidence in the outcome can grow even among people who disagree politically.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can plainly see that decisions are made fairly, securely, and without partisan favoritism. We should use transparent, verifiable procedures that are easy for everyday voters to understand: auditable paper records or paper ballots, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, timely and clear reporting of results, and routine risk-limiting post-election audits that are open to public observation. Oversight should be genuinely bipartisan and independent, with consistent baseline standards across jurisdictions and protections that let administrators do their jobs without political pressure. At the same time, institutions must communicate in clear, nonpartisan language\u2014through trusted local messengers and multilingual, accessible materials\u2014so communities understand how the system works, can evaluate misinformation, and feel confident that every eligible voter can participate and every valid vote is counted.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy for ordinary people to verify, consistent across communities, and fair to everyone who is eligible. That means clear, uniform baseline standards; secure systems with auditable paper records; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; routine, independent, publicly observable risk-limiting audits; and transparent, timely reporting that explains what is known, what is still being counted, and why. At the same time, institutions should expand practical access (early and mail options where appropriate, accommodations for disability and caregiving, and accurate multilingual information) and protect frontline administrators from political pressure. Finally, trust grows when communication is plain-language and nonpartisan, data and contracts are open to public inspection, misinformation is addressed with evidence rather than rhetoric, and community partners (schools, libraries, faith groups, employers, and local nonprofits) help people understand how the system works and how to raise concerns respectfully. The goal is accountability without exclusion: secure processes, open verification, and equal treatment so people can feel confident the rules are followed and their voice counts.",
