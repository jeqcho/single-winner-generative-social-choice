    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when institutions show their work\u2014clearly, consistently, and with real accountability. A strong middle-ground approach is to use voter-verifiable paper records backed by routine, independently administered audits that are open to bipartisan observers and summarized in plain language for the public. Election offices should communicate early and often\u2014what the rules are, how ballots are handled, what safeguards exist, and how problems are documented and fixed\u2014using multilingual materials and trusted local partners so information reaches people who don\u2019t follow politics closely. At the same time, the system should be both secure and practical: protect election workers, strengthen cybersecurity, standardize core procedures while allowing local implementation, and ensure eligible voters can participate through accessible polling places and reasonable options like early voting where feasible. When people can see that the process is verifiable, fair, and responsive to community needs, confidence rises across partisan and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few practical standards people can see and check for themselves: clear rules applied consistently, local accountability, and independent verification. Use voter\u2011verifiable paper records wherever possible, conduct routine post\u2011process audits by bipartisan/independent teams, and publish plain\u2011language summaries of what was done, what went wrong (if anything), and how it was fixed. Make access real for everyone by offering workable options (in\u2011person, early, and where allowed mail/absentee), protecting voters\u2019 rights, ensuring disability accommodations, and providing straightforward information in the major languages used in the community. Invest in cybersecurity and physical security for staff and facilities, and partner with trusted local groups\u2014schools, community organizations, and civic leaders\u2014to explain the process and answer questions without partisan spin. When institutions are transparent, auditable, safe, and understandable to everyday families, people don\u2019t have to \u201ctake someone\u2019s word for it\u201d\u2014they can trust the results because the evidence is public.",
