We should pair strong, practical safeguards (auditable paper records, routine independent audits, transparent reporting of problems and fixes, and protection for officials from political pressure) with broad, equal access (well-funded polling places, reasonable early and mail options, accommodations for disabilities, and accurate multilingual guidance). Institutions should communicate in plain language, publish measurable performance data, invite community observers, and work with trusted local groups to address questions and misinformation. By combining accountability, openness, and fairness, we can earn confidence across communities and political viewpoints.",

That means clear, consistent rules applied equally; secure voting with verifiable paper records; routine independent, publicly reported audits (including risk-limiting audits); and transparent reporting of problems and fixes.

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on transparency, equal treatment, and everyday accountability that people can see for themselves. That means clear, consistent rules applied the same way everywhere; secure, verifiable systems with paper records where possible; routine independent audits with results reported publicly in plain language; and strong protections against political interference and corruption. Trust also grows when institutions are accessible and respectful: convenient service options (like early and mail voting where legal), well-funded and well-staffed locations, accommodations for disabilities, and accurate multilingual information for households that speak Spanish and other languages. Finally, institutions should partner with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, faith groups, veterans\u2019 and civic organizations, and community leaders\u2014to explain how decisions are made, correct misinformation with facts, and create easy ways for the public to ask questions and report problems. If institutions are open about what they do, can prove the results, and treat everyone fairly, confidence will rise across communities and political viewpoints.",
