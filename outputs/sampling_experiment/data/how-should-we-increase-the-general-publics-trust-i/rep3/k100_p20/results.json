    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can independently verify that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and mistakes are corrected openly. A practical middle ground is to use voter-verified paper records (even when machines assist), publish clear chain-of-custody and security standards, and require routine, independent post-election audits with results explained in plain language and released promptly. Pair that with accessible voting options and information (including multilingual and disability-accessible support), plus consistent, nonpartisan customer-service expectations for election offices so voters are treated respectfully and get answers. Finally, create regular, local opportunities for the public and representatives from multiple viewpoints to observe, ask questions, and review evidence\u2014so confidence comes from transparent proof rather than partisan assurances.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can verify for themselves that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and results are checked the same way every time. We should use voter-verifiable paper ballots (or equivalent auditable records), maintain a clear chain of custody, and conduct routine, independent post-election audits\u2014such as risk-limiting audits\u2014with results published in plain language and open to public observation. Administration should be nonpartisan and accountable at the local level, with consistent procedures and bipartisan/independent oversight so no side feels locked out. At the same time, institutions should make participation and understanding easier through accessible polling places, options like early and mail voting where appropriate, multilingual and disability-friendly information, and strong civics education and community outreach. By pairing transparency and verification with access, professionalism, and clear communication that counters misinformation, institutions can earn confidence across communities and political viewpoints.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on changes that ordinary people can see, verify, and understand, regardless of party or background. That means transparent, locally accountable administration with clear and consistent rules; a voter-verifiable record (such as paper ballots or auditable paper trails); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections; and routine independent audits (including risk-limiting audits) with results published in plain language for the public to review. Trust also grows when participation is both secure and practical: accessible polling places, reasonable early and mail options with safeguards, and clear, multilingual voter information so every eligible voter can navigate the process confidently. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education and community outreach, invite bipartisan/nonpartisan observers, and address mistakes openly and quickly\u2014because credibility comes from transparency, fairness, and accountability, not slogans.",
