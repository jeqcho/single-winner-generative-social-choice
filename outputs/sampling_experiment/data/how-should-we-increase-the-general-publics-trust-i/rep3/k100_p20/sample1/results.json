    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see that the rules are fair, the work is competent, and leaders are accountable regardless of party. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity safeguards (voter-verifiable records such as paper ballots, clear chain-of-custody, routine independent audits, and transparent public reporting of problems and fixes) with broad, lawful access (adequate funding for polling places, reasonable early and mail options, disability and language accommodations, and consistent guidance so voters aren\u2019t surprised by last-minute changes). Institutions should also communicate in plain language, publish data and audit results in easy-to-check formats, invite nonpartisan observers from across the community, and respond quickly to misinformation with documented facts\u2014not rhetoric. When officials are protected from political pressure, processes are observable and verifiable, and service is reliable and respectful in every neighborhood, confidence can rebuild even among people who disagree on policy.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can clearly see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and everyone who is eligible can participate without unnecessary barriers. We should use verifiable voting methods (such as paper records), strict chain-of-custody, and routine independent audits like risk-limiting audits, with results and any issues reported publicly in plain language. Administration should be nonpartisan and locally accountable, guided by consistent standards that apply across jurisdictions, and protected from political interference. At the same time, access must be practical and inclusive: well-funded polling places, reasonable early and mail options where used, accommodations for disabilities, and accurate multilingual information. Finally, ongoing, nonpartisan civics and voter education\u2014delivered through trusted community groups, schools, and public forums\u2014can reduce misinformation and help people understand how outcomes are verified, so confidence is based on evidence and transparency rather than rhetoric.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on things people can see, verify, and understand, regardless of party or background. That means clear and consistent rules, well-trained local administrators protected from political pressure, and strong security measures such as paper-backed, auditable records, strict chain-of-custody, and routine independent post-election audits with results published in plain language. Trust also depends on fair access: enough convenient polling locations, reasonable early and mail options where allowed, accommodations for seniors and people with disabilities, and accurate multilingual information so every eligible voter knows what to do and what to expect. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and factually about problems and fixes, invite bipartisan and community observation, and invest in practical civics education\u2014so families can understand how decisions are made, how money is spent, and how accountability works. When institutions are transparent, consistently applied, and responsive, confidence can grow even among people who disagree on politics.",
