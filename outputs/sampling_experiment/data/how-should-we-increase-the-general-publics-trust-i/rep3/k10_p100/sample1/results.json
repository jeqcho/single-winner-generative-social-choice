    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see clear standards, real accountability, and fair treatment in practice\u2014not just promises. A workable middle ground is to make key public systems more transparent and verifiable (clear rules, publicly available performance metrics, independent audits/inspections, and straightforward reporting when things go wrong), while protecting privacy and security. Decisions should be explained in plain language, with accessible information in multiple languages and formats, and with meaningful chances for community input through local forums and oversight boards that include diverse viewpoints. Institutions should also enforce strong ethics rules, reduce conflicts of interest, and apply policies consistently so people believe outcomes aren\u2019t driven by favoritism or politics. When residents can understand how decisions are made, verify that safeguards exist, and see problems acknowledged and fixed, trust becomes earned and durable.",

At the same time, participation should be practical and welcoming: clear multilingual information, disability\u2011accessible polling places, convenient options like early voting and secure mail voting, and well\u2011trained staff who treat every voter with respect. Finally, schools, libraries, faith communities, and trusted local organizations should help provide nonpartisan civics and media\u2011literacy education so rumors don\u2019t fill information gaps.

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on everyday transparency, consistent rules, and respectful service that people can see in their own communities. That means using voter-verifiable paper records, strict chain-of-custody, and routine independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results published clearly and promptly so anyone can understand how outcomes were confirmed. At the same time, institutions must make participation and information truly accessible: plain-language explanations, multilingual materials (including Spanish), disability-friendly design, and convenient options that fit working families and seniors, without compromising security. Trust also grows when oversight is nonpartisan and local\u2014inviting bipartisan observers and community partners like schools, libraries, and faith and neighborhood groups to help explain processes, counter misinformation with facts, and create a calm place for questions. When institutions consistently show their work, admit and fix mistakes openly, and treat every person with dignity, confidence can rebuild across generations and backgrounds.",
