A practical middle ground is to use voter-verifiable paper records (or a paper backup for any technology), publish strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and require routine risk-limiting audits run by bipartisan/independent teams with findings released in plain language. Communities should be able to observe key steps, see timely and consistent reporting, and get accurate information through trusted local messengers\u2014libraries, schools, veteran groups, faith and civic organizations\u2014so rumors don\u2019t fill the gap. At the same time, states should provide accessible options (reasonable ID pathways, language assistance, disability accommodations, and hours that fit working families) so integrity and participation reinforce each other rather than compete.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the process easy to observe, and the results independently verifiable, while ensuring every eligible person can participate. That means using paper ballots (or paper-backed records), strict chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine bipartisan/independent risk-limiting audits with public, plain-language reporting of what was checked and what was found. Trust also grows when administration is nonpartisan and locally accountable within consistent statewide standards, and when accurate information is shared quickly to counter rumors and misinformation. Finally, we should pair integrity with access: convenient voting options, accessible polling places, and multilingual voter education so working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and bilingual communities can understand how votes are cast, counted, and verified\u2014and see that outcomes reflect the will of the voters.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the process easy to understand, easy to access, and easy to verify, no matter where someone lives or what language they speak at home. That means clear and consistent rules, secure paper ballots (or paper records) everywhere, strict chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine bipartisan/independent risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language. Communities should have multiple convenient ways to vote (in-person, early, and mail where available), polling places that work for busy families and people with disabilities, and accurate information in English and Spanish through trusted local channels like schools, libraries, and community groups. Alongside this, we need strong civics education and rapid, fact-based responses to misinformation, so people can see for themselves that outcomes reflect voters\u2014not politics\u2014and that accountability is real.",
