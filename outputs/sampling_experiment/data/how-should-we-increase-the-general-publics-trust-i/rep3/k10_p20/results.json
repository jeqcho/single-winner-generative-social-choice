    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can verify that rules are fair, applied consistently, and enforced with real accountability. A durable middle ground is to pair strong, easy-to-understand safeguards (a voter-verifiable paper record or equivalent, transparent chain-of-custody, and routine bipartisan/independent post-election audits) with broad access (adequate staffing, convenient hours, disability accommodations, and multilingual information). Institutions should publish plain-language explanations, audit results, and incident reports quickly, invite structured public observation, and work with trusted local partners\u2014schools, libraries, and community groups\u2014to provide accurate civic education and counter misinformation without partisan messaging. When integrity measures are visible and participation is genuinely practical for everyone, confidence rises because outcomes are both secure and credibly earned.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the process easy to follow, and the results independently verifiable in ways regular people can see and understand. That means using paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records everywhere, maintaining strict chain-of-custody, and conducting routine bipartisan/independent risk-limiting audits with publicly posted results and plain-language explanations of what was checked and what was found. Trust also grows when access is fair and practical for busy families, workers, seniors, and people with disabilities: well-staffed polling places, flexible hours, secure early and mail options where allowed, and reliable accommodations. Communication must meet communities where they are\u2014through schools, libraries, local media, and trusted community groups\u2014with materials in the languages people use (including Spanish) and rapid, fact-based responses to misinformation, while protecting voter privacy. Finally, institutions should be accountable locally and transparently: publish performance metrics (wait times, error rates, audit outcomes), invite trained public observers, and enforce consistent standards so people across parties and backgrounds can see that the same rules are applied fairly to everyone.",
