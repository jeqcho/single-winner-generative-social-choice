    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules applied fairly, evidence that systems work as promised, and real consequences when they don\u2019t. A practical middle ground is to pair strong transparency and independent oversight (auditable records, routine public audits, published performance and security reports, and open meetings where feasible) with equal, barrier-free access and respectful service for every community (reasonable accommodations for language, disability, work schedules, and rural access). Institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual terms, correct mistakes quickly, protect frontline workers, and invite bipartisan and community observers so accountability isn\u2019t just claimed\u2014it\u2019s demonstrated. Finally, sustained civics and media-literacy education and consistent standards help people judge claims by facts rather than rumors, making trust more durable over time.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the safeguards visible, and participation genuinely accessible. That means nonpartisan administration with consistent standards, verifiable paper records (or equivalent auditable trails), strict chain-of-custody, robust cybersecurity, and routine independent, bipartisan risk-limiting audits with results reported publicly in plain language. Access should be expanded without sacrificing security: convenient polling locations, safe early and mail voting where offered, disability accommodations, and multilingual information so every eligible voter can understand how ballots are cast, counted, and verified. Finally, sustained civic education and community outreach\u2014through schools, local groups, and trusted messengers\u2014should address misinformation with facts, invite public observation where appropriate, and show people, step by step, that the system is fair, accountable, and worthy of confidence.",

That means setting clear, consistent rules; using independent oversight and regular audits; and publishing plain\u2011language, multilingual explanations of what was decided, why, what evidence was used, and how problems are found and fixed. Institutions should reduce conflicts of interest, strengthen ethics enforcement, protect whistleblowers, and share performance measures (costs, wait times, outcomes) so people can judge results, not slogans. Trust also grows when services are accessible and respectful\u2014simple forms, disability accommodations, language help, convenient hours, and staff who answer questions\u2014while safeguarding privacy and security. Finally, leaders and media partners should correct misinformation quickly with transparent data and community outreach through trusted local groups (schools, faith communities, libraries, neighborhood organizations), so accountability is visible and every community feels heard and treated fairly.",
