    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are followed, and get honest answers when something goes wrong. A practical middle ground is to set clear, consistent standards for integrity and transparency\u2014independent oversight, regular public audits or inspections, strong cybersecurity and privacy protections, and strict conflict-of-interest rules\u2014while keeping services accessible and fair for everyone. Institutions should publish plain-language, multilingual explanations of policies and outcomes, release timely data and evidence behind major decisions, and create safe, well-advertised channels for questions, complaints, and whistleblowing. Finally, leaders should commit to admitting mistakes, correcting them publicly, and measuring performance against shared metrics, so trust is earned through reliability rather than partisan messaging.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on processes that ordinary people can see, understand, and verify, while keeping participation fair and accessible. That means clear, simple rules applied consistently, local nonpartisan administration with bipartisan and independent oversight, and strong, practical safeguards such as secure paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), strict chain-of-custody, and routine risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language. We should also invest in cybersecurity and promptly disclose and fix problems instead of hiding them.\n\nTrust grows when information is easy to get and designed for real communities: timely, factual updates; multilingual materials (including Spanish); and disability-friendly, straightforward guidance on how voting works and how results are checked. Finally, ongoing civics education and community outreach\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations\u2014can help people separate facts from rumors and see accountability in action. When institutions are transparent, independently reviewable, and respectful of every eligible voter, confidence can be earned across political lines.",
