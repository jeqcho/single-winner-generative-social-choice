    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014rises when people can see clear standards, real accountability, and everyday respect for the public. We should set transparent, nonpartisan rules; use verifiable records (such as paper ballots or other auditable trails) with routine independent audits; and publish results, audit findings, and any problems\u2014and fixes\u2014in plain language that is accessible, multilingual, and disability-friendly. Institutions should also welcome public observation and credible third-party review, protect workers from threats, and invest in cybersecurity and consistent training so procedures are reliable across locations. Finally, trust grows when leaders and agencies correct misinformation with evidence, invite community partners like schools, libraries, and local civic groups to explain how systems work, and make participation and services easy for eligible people without sacrificing security or privacy.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the process is easy to understand, independently verifiable, and fair to every eligible voter\u2014regardless of party, language, disability, or schedule. We should use auditable paper ballots (or equivalent voter-verified records), maintain strict chain-of-custody, and conduct routine risk-limiting audits with bipartisan and independent oversight, then publish clear, plain-language results and explanations that anyone can follow. At the same time, elections must remain accessible through well-run polling places, secure early and mail voting options with strong safeguards, and multilingual, disability-friendly information. Finally, sustained nonpartisan civics and media literacy education\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted community groups\u2014can reduce misinformation, encourage calm fact-based dialogue, and show voters the real protections that keep outcomes accurate and accountable.",

That means transparent processes with independent oversight (including routine audits), strong cybersecurity and secure record-keeping, and clear public reporting that explains what happened, what worked, and what problems were found and fixed. Just as important, institutions should make participation and services genuinely accessible: plain-language information, multilingual support, disability accommodations, convenient options for working families, and respectful customer-service standards at every public-facing office. To reduce misinformation and confusion without dismissing concerns, institutions should partner with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, faith and community groups\u2014and invest in civics and media literacy so people know how decisions are made and how to verify claims. When institutions consistently tell the truth, show their work, admit mistakes, and correct them quickly, trust can be earned across political lines and communities.",
