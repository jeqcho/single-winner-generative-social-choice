    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent standards, and real accountability. We should use voting systems that are easy to verify (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records), require routine independent audits with publicly posted results, and enforce strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections. Access and integrity should be strengthened together: convenient options like early voting and secure mail voting, plus practical safeguards like accurate voter rolls, transparent check-in procedures, and reasonable identity verification that includes free, easy-to-get alternatives and accommodations for disabilities and language needs. Institutions should communicate in plain, nonpartisan language, acknowledge mistakes quickly, and explain how problems are fixed. Finally, invest in ongoing civic and media literacy through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations so misinformation loses power and people can judge claims using evidence rather than fear.",

We should prioritize transparent, nonpartisan oversight; routine independent audits and public reporting; strong security and privacy protections; and clear, plain-language communication (including multilingual and disability-accessible formats) about what rules are used and why. Institutions should publish data, methods, and performance metrics where possible, correct misinformation with evidence without dismissing legitimate concerns, and create regular opportunities for community participation through schools, libraries, and local organizations. When processes are consistent, open to observation, and focused on fair service to every resident, confidence rises across political lines.",

That means using voting systems with auditable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent voter-verifiable paper trails), maintaining strict chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity, and conducting routine, publicly reported risk-limiting audits overseen by independent, bipartisan teams. Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, publish easy-to-find explanations of what happened and why (including problems and fixes), and offer accessible participation options\u2014convenient polling locations and hours, disability accommodations, and secure mail/early voting where allowed\u2014so access and integrity rise together. Finally, sustained civic and media literacy education through schools, libraries, and trusted local community groups can reduce misinformation by giving people practical tools to check claims against transparent, published facts. When institutions show their work, admit mistakes, and prove outcomes with evidence, trust can be earned across communities.",
