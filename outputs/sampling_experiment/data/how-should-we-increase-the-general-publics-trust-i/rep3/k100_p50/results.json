We should use secure, auditable systems with a voter-verifiable paper record, strict chain-of-custody, and routine independent risk-limiting audits whose methods and results are published in plain language for the public to review. Administration should be nonpartisan and accountable at the local level, with consistent standards, strong cybersecurity, and timely, honest communication about problems and fixes. At the same time, trust requires real accessibility: well-funded polling places, safe early and mail voting options, language assistance, and disability accommodations so every eligible voter can participate without unnecessary barriers. Finally, sustained civics and media-literacy education\u2014delivered through schools and trusted community organizations\u2014can reduce misinformation and help people evaluate claims using evidence rather than spin.",

When people can see the checks, understand the rules, and experience fair treatment in their own community, trust rises\u2014even when the outcome isn\u2019t what they hoped for.",
