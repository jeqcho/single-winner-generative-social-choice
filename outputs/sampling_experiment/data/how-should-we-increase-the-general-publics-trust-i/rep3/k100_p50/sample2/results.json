    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is rebuilt when people can see fair rules applied consistently, real accountability when things go wrong, and everyday services delivered competently. A practical middle ground is to make key decisions and results easy to verify (clear standards, independent audits and inspectors, public dashboards with plain-language explanations), protect systems from partisan interference (ethics rules, conflict-of-interest limits, transparent procurement, whistleblower protections), and create regular two-way engagement through local forums, community liaisons, and multilingual communication. Institutions should publish what they know, what they don\u2019t know, and what they\u2019re doing to fix problems\u2014while safeguarding privacy and security\u2014so people across political and cultural lines can judge performance based on evidence rather than rhetoric.",

We should use verifiable paper ballots (or paper records), strict chain-of-custody, and routine independent risk-limiting audits with plain-language public reports that anyone can review. Administration should be nonpartisan and locally accountable, with bipartisan observation and strong cybersecurity and safety protections for election workers and voters. At the same time, participation must be practical and welcoming for every eligible voter through accessible polling places, flexible options like early and mail voting where appropriate, and clear multilingual information so families don\u2019t have to rely on rumors or partisan spin to understand how votes are cast, counted, and verified.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should make the rules and results easy for ordinary people to verify, and make everyday services feel fair, competent, and respectful. That starts with radical transparency and accountability: clear standards that are applied consistently, independent oversight and routine audits, strict anti-corruption rules, and plain-language public reporting of performance, errors, and fixes. Institutions should invite community observation and feedback\u2014through local advisory boards, open meetings, and accessible data\u2014so people can see how decisions are made and how money is spent.\n\nTrust also requires equal, practical access. Information must be clear, multilingual, and disability-friendly; processes should be simple, predictable, and designed around real life (reasonable hours, straightforward forms, responsive help). Frontline workers must be supported and protected so they can do their jobs without political pressure or harassment, while still being held to high standards.\n\nFinally, institutions should communicate honestly: distinguish facts from opinions, correct mistakes quickly, and address misinformation with evidence without dismissing legitimate concerns. When people can see transparent checks, fair treatment, and real consequences for failures, confidence can grow across political, cultural, and generational lines.",
