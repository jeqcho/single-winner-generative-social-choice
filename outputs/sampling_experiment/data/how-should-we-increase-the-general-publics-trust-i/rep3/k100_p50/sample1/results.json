Institutions should make key processes transparent and independently verifiable through regular audits, open reporting of performance and mistakes, and clear standards that are applied consistently. Communication should be timely, plain-language, and multilingual, delivered through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, faith and community groups), with easy ways for the public to ask questions, observe, and provide feedback. At the same time, institutions should protect equal access and dignity for everyone\u2014removing barriers, enforcing strong ethics and anti-corruption safeguards, and correcting misinformation with evidence without dismissing legitimate concerns. When people experience reliable service, honest self-correction, and visible oversight close to home, trust can rebuild across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that the rules are fair, the work is competent, and leaders are accountable to the public rather than to politics. We should design processes that are easy to understand and independently verifiable\u2014clear written standards, publicly documented decision-making, regular third-party audits, and plain-language reporting of results and any problems that occurred. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and open to observation, with strong cybersecurity and protections against intimidation, corruption, and misinformation, while keeping access simple and barrier-free for all eligible participants through accessible, multilingual information and accommodations. Finally, trust is strengthened locally: invest in well-trained frontline staff, partner with trusted community institutions (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups), and create regular opportunities for respectful public questions and feedback so accountability is visible in everyday life.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is earned when decisions are made openly, rules are applied consistently, and people can independently verify that promises match results. We should set clear, nonpartisan standards for how institutions collect information, spend money, and measure outcomes; publish plain\u2011language reports and dashboards that show performance and mistakes; and require routine independent audits with findings that the public can review. Trust also grows when services are accessible and respectful\u2014through multilingual communication, disability-friendly options, and local offices that treat every person fairly\u2014so no community feels ignored or targeted. Finally, institutions should engage communities directly (schools, libraries, faith groups, unions, and neighborhood organizations), respond quickly to misinformation with evidence, and create simple ways for residents to observe, give feedback, and see how concerns are resolved. Transparency, accountability, and equal treatment\u2014paired with real-world results people can see in their own communities\u2014are the most durable path to rebuilding trust.",
