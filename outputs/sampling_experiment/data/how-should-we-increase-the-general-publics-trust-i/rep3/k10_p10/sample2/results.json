    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, transparently, and with real accountability. We should combine strong, verifiable safeguards (auditable records, routine independent audits, and robust cybersecurity) with clear, plain-language public reporting so anyone can understand how outcomes were reached. Institutions should communicate early and often, correct mistakes openly, and create meaningful ways for community members across parties and backgrounds to observe, ask questions, and give feedback\u2014without compromising privacy or safety. Just as important, access must be practical and equal: multilingual information, accessible services, and convenient options so participation isn\u2019t reserved for those with time, money, or insider knowledge. By pairing transparency with integrity, and openness with inclusion, institutions can earn trust through consistent performance rather than slogans.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decisions and outcomes transparently verifiable, consistently fair, and easy for people to understand and participate in. That means nonpartisan administration with clear rules; auditable paper records and routine independent post-election audits; strong cybersecurity and safety protections for voters and workers; and timely, plain-language public reporting when issues arise and how they are resolved. Trust also grows when access is genuinely equal: convenient early and mail voting options, well-located polling sites, and accommodations for disabilities and families. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education and local, multilingual community outreach through schools, libraries, faith groups, and neighborhood organizations, while countering misinformation with facts and evidence\u2014so people can see, verify, and confidently rely on the systems meant to serve everyone.",

Trust also grows when access is fair and practical for working families and older voters: convenient polling locations, early and mail voting options, disability accommodations, and straightforward registration\u2014paired with strong safeguards against fraud and intimidation. Finally, institutions should earn trust through communication that meets people where they are: plain-language and multilingual information, community-based education through schools and libraries, and rapid, evidence-based responses to misinformation\u2014while protecting voter privacy. When people can see how decisions are made, how problems are fixed, and how accountability works, confidence rises across political and cultural lines.",
