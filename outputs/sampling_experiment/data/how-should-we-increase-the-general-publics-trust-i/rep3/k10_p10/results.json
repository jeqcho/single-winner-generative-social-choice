    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is rebuilt when people can see how decisions are made, how money is spent, and what happens when mistakes occur. A reasonable middle ground is to pair strong transparency and independent oversight (clear public reporting, open meetings where feasible, audits and inspectors general with real authority, and meaningful consequences for misconduct) with reliable service and respectful communication (plain-language explanations, timely updates, and accessible channels for feedback and appeals). Institutions should measure performance against shared, nonpartisan standards\u2014fairness, legality, privacy, and effectiveness\u2014and publish results so the public can verify progress. Finally, partnering with trusted local organizations and investing in civic education and media literacy can reduce misinformation and help communities engage constructively, without demanding that everyone agree on politics to agree on accountability.",

That means setting clear, consistent rules; publishing timely, plain-language explanations of decisions and performance; and using independent audits and public reporting so outcomes can be checked rather than simply trusted. Institutions should invest in strong security and privacy protections, while keeping services accessible\u2014offering multiple ways to participate and get help, including multilingual information and accommodations for busy working families. Finally, partnering with trusted local community organizations and creating regular, respectful forums to address concerns and misinformation can strengthen confidence by showing institutions listen, explain, and correct mistakes openly.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should focus on a few basics that people across backgrounds can see and verify: clear rules, visible accountability, and fair treatment. That means publishing plain-language explanations of how decisions are made, what standards are used, and how the public can appeal or correct mistakes; making outcomes auditable through independent oversight, open records where appropriate, and regular performance reporting; and enforcing strong ethics rules that prevent conflicts of interest and ensure consequences for misconduct. Institutions should also make access simple and practical\u2014timely service, respectful communication, language access, and options that work for working families, seniors, and people with limited transportation\u2014while protecting privacy and safety. Finally, trust grows when institutions meet people where they are: partnering with trusted local organizations (schools, libraries, community groups, faith organizations) for two-way listening and problem-solving, and correcting misinformation with clear facts, not partisan spin. The goal is straightforward: institutions that are competent, transparent, and accountable enough that ordinary residents can check the work and feel heard.",
