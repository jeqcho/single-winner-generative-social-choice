    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, how money is spent, and how leaders are held accountable\u2014regardless of party or ideology. A practical middle ground is to raise transparency (publish clear performance metrics, audits, and meeting records), strengthen independent oversight and ethics rules (inspectors general, whistleblower protections, conflict-of-interest limits), and make services work better in everyday life (simpler processes, reliable response times, and respectful treatment). Institutions should communicate in plain language, correct errors quickly, and invite meaningful public input through open hearings, community partnerships, and accessible information in multiple languages. By pairing measurable results with fair rules and real accountability, we can rebuild confidence without asking anyone to \u201cjust trust\u201d the system.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially in elections\u2014we should focus on rules and safeguards that are easy for everyday people to understand and independently verify. That means using auditable paper records, maintaining clear chain-of-custody, and conducting routine, nonpartisan post\u2011event audits with public, plain\u2011language reporting at the local level. Institutions should communicate early and often with timely, factual updates; provide accessible, multilingual information; and make it straightforward for people to ask questions and see how decisions are made. Strong cybersecurity and privacy protections, transparent oversight that is genuinely bipartisan/nonpartisan, and sustained engagement through trusted community partners can reduce misinformation, improve accountability, and make participation practical for working families\u2014so confidence is built through consistent, visible proof, not slogans.",

That means setting clear standards, publishing easy-to-read performance metrics, and using independent oversight (including audits and public reporting) that is genuinely nonpartisan and open to scrutiny. Institutions should communicate early and clearly in plain language\u2014and in the languages communities actually use\u2014through trusted local partners like schools, libraries, community groups, and faith organizations, while also creating safe, respectful ways for residents and frontline workers to report problems without retaliation. Services should be accessible and consistent (reasonable hours, multiple ways to get help, accommodations for seniors and working families), and technology should improve transparency and privacy\u2014not replace human accountability. When institutions show their work, invite constructive feedback, and apply rules evenly, trust can grow across different backgrounds and political views.",
