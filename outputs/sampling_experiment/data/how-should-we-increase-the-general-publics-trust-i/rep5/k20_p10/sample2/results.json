    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see that rules are fair, outcomes are verifiable, and officials are accountable regardless of party. A practical middle ground is to pair broad, secure access to voting (reasonable registration options, accessible polling places, and clear accommodations) with strong integrity measures: paper-based records or voter-verifiable paper trails, transparent chain-of-custody procedures, routine risk-limiting audits, and independent oversight with findings published promptly. Institutions should communicate in plain language, proactively correct misinformation with evidence, and make key data and processes easy for the public and media to review without compromising privacy or security. By consistently showing their work\u2014before, during, and after Election Day\u2014election systems can earn confidence from skeptics and supporters alike and strengthen trust in the results.",

We should invest in secure, auditable voting systems that include verifiable paper records, strong chain-of-custody procedures, and routine risk-limiting audits with publicly reported findings. Election administration should be nonpartisan and accountable, with independent oversight that explains both safeguards and any problems plainly and promptly to reduce misinformation. At the same time, participation must be accessible: reliable registration, safe and convenient voting options, accessible polling places, and clear, plain-language voter information available in multiple languages. When integrity measures and access go hand in hand\u2014and officials communicate transparently\u2014more Americans can feel confident their vote is protected, counted accurately, and respected.",

Institutions should make decisions and outcomes easy to verify (using independent oversight, routine audits, and strong safeguards like secure records and clear chains of responsibility), and they should explain those safeguards in plain language that is available in multiple languages and formats. Just as important, institutions must be accessible and welcoming: simple steps, reasonable wait times, and equal treatment no matter your background, neighborhood, or income. Leaders should communicate early and often, publish transparent performance measures, respond quickly to misinformation and errors with evidence, and invite community participation\u2014through local meetings, schools, and trusted community partners\u2014so people understand how the system works and feel confident it works for them.",
