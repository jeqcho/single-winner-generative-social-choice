    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and meaningfully influence how decisions are made\u2014and when the same rules apply to everyone. A practical middle path is to pair strong integrity measures (clear standards, independent oversight, published performance metrics, and regular audits) with genuine accessibility and responsiveness (plain-language explanations, multilingual services, easy ways to report problems, and timely correction when mistakes occur). Institutions should invite community participation through public meetings, citizen advisory panels, and transparent complaint processes, while protecting privacy and preventing intimidation or corruption. Consistent enforcement, open data where feasible, and respectful communication\u2014especially in moments of controversy\u2014help turn trust into something earned through proven competence and fairness rather than demanded by authority.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections is strengthened when every eligible voter can participate and when results are clearly verifiable. That means using transparent, consistently applied rules; secure ballot handling with clear chain-of-custody; and auditable safeguards such as paper records and risk-limiting, independent post-election audits with publicly reported results. Elections should be administered competently and nonpartisanly, with prompt, plain-language communication about how votes are cast, counted, and checked, including how problems are detected and corrected. Pairing these protections with accessible voting options, strong security practices, and ongoing civic education and community outreach helps people across different backgrounds feel respected, informed, and confident that outcomes reflect the will of the voters.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy for ordinary people to verify, consistent across communities, and responsive when mistakes happen. That means clear rules applied equally; secure processes with paper records or other tamper-evident trails; strict chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity; and routine, independent audits (including risk-limiting audits) with results published in plain language. Institutions should communicate early and often through nonpartisan channels, provide multilingual and accessible information, and make it simple for working families, seniors, and people with disabilities to participate without sacrificing privacy or security. Trust also grows when oversight is balanced and local\u2014using bipartisan or multi-stakeholder boards, transparent public dashboards for key steps, and open hearings that take concerns seriously\u2014while schools, employers, unions, and community groups strengthen civic education and help people understand how safeguards work. In short: earn trust through verifiable evidence, fair and consistent administration, and respectful, practical service to every community.",
