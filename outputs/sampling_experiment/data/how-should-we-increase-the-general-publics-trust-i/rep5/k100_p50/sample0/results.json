We should use voter-verifiable paper records (or equally auditable records), strict chain-of-custody, robust cybersecurity, and routine independent risk-limiting audits, with bipartisan/nonpartisan observers and public reporting of findings and fixes. Voting should remain accessible and orderly through well-run polling places and secure options like early or mail voting with reliable ballot tracking. Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, teach basic civic literacy in schools and communities, and respond quickly and transparently to mistakes, misinformation, intimidation, or interference so the public can trust the process even when their side loses.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared commitments: clear rules, consistent enforcement, and proof that outcomes can be independently verified. That means using secure, auditable systems (such as voter-verified paper records where feasible), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine independent post-election audits with publicly posted results, and meaningful oversight that is nonpartisan and includes observers from different political viewpoints. Trust also depends on fair access and respectful service: well-staffed polling places, disability accommodations, language-accessible materials, reasonable options like early voting and secure mail voting with ballot tracking, and timely explanations when problems occur and how they are fixed. Finally, institutions should communicate in plain language\u2014through schools, libraries, local media, veterans\u2019 and faith groups, unions, and community organizations\u2014so people understand how decisions are made, how complaints are handled, and how accountability works. When people can see the process, verify the safeguards, and feel treated with dignity, confidence in the results\u2014and in the institutions behind them\u2014can grow across communities.",
