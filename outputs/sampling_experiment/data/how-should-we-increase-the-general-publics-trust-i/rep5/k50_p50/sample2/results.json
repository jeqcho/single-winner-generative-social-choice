    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, competently, and with real accountability\u2014no matter who is in power. A practical middle ground is to set clear baseline standards for integrity and access: transparent rules applied consistently, independent audits and public reporting that allow verification, strong protections for privacy and cybersecurity, and firm consequences for fraud, conflicts of interest, and abuses of authority. At the same time, institutions should make participation and service easier\u2014plain-language, multilingual information; respectful, responsive customer service; and community partnerships (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups) that listen to concerns and explain how decisions are made. Finally, leaders should commit to honest communication\u2014sharing data, admitting mistakes, and correcting misinformation quickly\u2014so trust is earned through evidence, not rhetoric.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on practices people can see, understand, and independently verify. That means nonpartisan, professional administration; verifiable paper records for every ballot (or an equivalent voter-verified paper trail); strict chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity; and routine, bipartisan/independent post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) with timely public reporting of results and any discrepancies in plain language. Trust also grows when participation is straightforward and fair for eligible voters through well\u2011resourced polling places, clear and consistent rules, and accessible information\u2014including multilingual materials\u2014delivered through trusted local partners like schools, libraries, and community organizations. Finally, institutions should counter misinformation by publishing facts, data, and explanations quickly, welcoming lawful observation from multiple viewpoints, and holding bad actors accountable so people can accept outcomes with confidence, win or lose.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is earned when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability\u2014alongside services that are accessible and respectful to every community. To rebuild trust, institutions should make decisions and spending transparent (plain-language explanations, open data where appropriate, and independent audits), strengthen ethics and anti-corruption safeguards, and publish timely performance measures so the public can judge results, not rhetoric. Oversight should be genuinely independent and bipartisan where relevant, with clear processes to investigate mistakes or misconduct and consequences when standards are violated.\n\nAt the same time, trust rises when institutions work well in everyday life: shorter wait times, reliable customer service, fair treatment, and easy access for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and multilingual households. Partnering with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, faith groups, unions, veterans\u2019 groups, and community organizations\u2014can improve two-way communication, counter misinformation with facts, and ensure people are heard without being dismissed.\n\nIn short: make institutions more transparent, more accountable, and more responsive\u2014so people can verify how decisions are made and experience competence and fairness in practice.",
