    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and meaningfully influence how decisions are made\u2014and when rules are applied fairly to everyone. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, independently verified accountability (clear standards, open data where appropriate, regular third-party audits, enforceable ethics and anti-corruption rules, and real consequences for misconduct) with everyday accessibility (plain-language communication, multilingual services, respectful frontline staff, predictable processes, and easy ways to get help or appeal a decision). Institutions should routinely explain not just what they decided, but why\u2014showing the evidence, tradeoffs, and uncertainties\u2014while protecting privacy and safety. Finally, sustained civic education and community partnerships (schools, libraries, local nonprofits, faith groups, and professional associations) can create trusted channels for two-way dialogue, so misinformation is addressed quickly and residents feel heard, represented, and confident that the system works for them, not just for insiders.",

Institutions should pair these safeguards with broad, practical access (well-staffed polling places, reasonable accommodations for disability and language needs, and reliable options for working families), plus transparent, timely reporting and prompt investigation of irregularities. Finally, sustained nonpartisan civic education and community outreach\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations\u2014should explain how the process works and how people can check it, so confidence is built on evidence, fairness, and accountability rather than slogans.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a simple promise that people across backgrounds can verify: clear rules, fair access, and transparent proof that the rules were followed. That means nonpartisan, professionally staffed administration; secure, auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails); strict chain-of-custody; routine independent risk-limiting audits; and timely public reporting that explains results, audits, and any problems in plain language. Trust also grows when participation is practical for working people, seniors, and disabled voters\u2014through well-run polling places, reasonable wait times, secure early and mail options where used, and strong language access (including Spanish) so families can understand the process. Finally, institutions should earn credibility by communicating calmly and consistently, partnering with trusted local groups (schools, libraries, veterans and faith communities, community organizations), and enforcing rules evenly so misconduct is investigated and corrected transparently. When people can both participate easily and independently see how integrity is protected, confidence follows even when we disagree on outcomes.",
