    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see that the rules are fair, the work is competent, and mistakes are caught and corrected without partisan favoritism. A practical middle ground is to set clear baseline standards for security and access (with flexibility for local administration), use verifiable records with routine, publicly reported audits, and enforce strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity practices. Institutions should publish easy-to-follow explanations of key procedures, timelines, and decisions; invite balanced independent observation; and share after-action reports that describe problems, fixes, and lessons learned. Just as important, leaders and officials should commit to calm, evidence-based communication and consistent accountability\u2014so the public can distinguish verified facts from rumors and feel confident the system is both inclusive and reliable.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014we should focus on transparency people can see, verification that doesn\u2019t depend on any one party, and service that treats every community with equal respect. That means clear, consistent baseline rules; strong physical and cybersecurity protections; and verifiable records with routine, independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits) that are open to bipartisan observers and reported publicly. Institutions should communicate in plain language, quickly acknowledge and correct mistakes, and publish what happened and how it was fixed, instead of relying on slogans or partisan messaging. At the same time, access must remain practical for working families, seniors, rural residents, and people with disabilities\u2014through reliable polling places, reasonable early and mail options with tracking, and multilingual information where needed. Finally, trust grows when oversight is local enough to be accountable, but supported by professional standards, training, and ongoing public feedback so people can judge outcomes by evidence rather than rumor.",
