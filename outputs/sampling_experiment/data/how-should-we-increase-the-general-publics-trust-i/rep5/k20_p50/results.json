    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability, no matter which side wins. We should adopt secure, voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent auditable records), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity practices, and routine independent audits with results published in plain language. Institutions should welcome bipartisan and nonpartisan observation, investigate problems quickly, and disclose what happened and how it was fixed without defensiveness. At the same time, participation must remain broadly accessible through well-resourced polling places, reasonable accommodations for disability and language needs, and straightforward options like early voting or secure ballot tracking where used. Finally, year-round civic education and transparent public dashboards can replace rumors with evidence, helping people judge outcomes by process and proof rather than politics.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should make decisions and results easier for ordinary people to verify, and easier for institutions to explain. That starts with radical clarity: publish plain-language (and multilingual) explanations of rules, responsibilities, and how outcomes are checked; release timely, accessible data and reports; and openly acknowledge mistakes with clear corrective actions and consequences for misconduct.\n\nTrust also requires independent oversight and consistent standards. Institutions should use routine third\u2011party audits, transparent performance metrics, and conflict\u2011of\u2011interest safeguards, with bipartisan or cross\u2011community observer access where appropriate\u2014so the public can see that rules are applied fairly and consistently, not based on who has power.\n\nFinally, institutions must earn trust through daily service: treat people with respect, make services accessible (including disability access and convenient hours/locations), protect privacy and security, and partner with trusted local groups\u2014schools, libraries, faith and community organizations\u2014to provide civic education, answer questions, and counter misinformation with fact-based, calm communication. When institutions are verifiable, accountable, and responsive, more people can accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",
