    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in democratic institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see clear evidence that decisions are made fairly, competently, and with equal respect for every eligible citizen. A durable approach is to pair strong, verifiable safeguards (voter-verified records, secure chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and robust cyber and physical security) with rules that are consistent and easy to understand, while still allowing practical local administration. Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, publish timely audit and incident reports, and invite nonpartisan observation so concerns are addressed with facts rather than rumors. At the same time, we should reduce unnecessary barriers by expanding accessible voting options, improving voter education, and partnering with trusted community organizations so participation is broad and confidence is earned\u2014no matter who wins.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the evidence verifiable, and the process understandable to everyone. That means using voter-verifiable paper ballots (or auditable paper records), protecting ballots with strong chain-of-custody, and conducting routine, independent risk-limiting audits with bipartisan observation so results can be checked and confirmed. We should set consistent baseline standards across jurisdictions, strengthen cybersecurity and physical security, and publish plain-language, timely reports and public data about how ballots were handled, counted, audited, and certified\u2014including how any problems were investigated and fixed. Trust also requires broad, fair access: well-staffed polling places, secure options like early voting and ballot tracking where used, and clear multilingual voter information so eligible voters can participate confidently. Finally, institutions should invest in nonpartisan civic education and ongoing community outreach\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted local partners\u2014to counter misinformation with transparent facts and respectful accountability.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on rules and results that people can verify for themselves: transparent procedures, nonpartisan administration, and clear accountability when something goes wrong. That means using auditable records (such as voter-verified paper ballots or equally verifiable systems), routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where appropriate), strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections, and consistent baseline standards so the process is predictable and fair across communities.\n\nTrust also depends on accessibility and understanding. Institutions should make participation practical for working families, seniors, disabled voters, and multilingual communities through secure, convenient options and plain-language, multilingual explanations of how decisions are made and how outcomes are checked. Finally, officials and trusted local partners (schools, libraries, community and faith organizations) should provide ongoing civics education and timely, evidence-based public updates that address misinformation and legitimate concerns respectfully\u2014so confidence is built on shared facts rather than partisan rhetoric.",
