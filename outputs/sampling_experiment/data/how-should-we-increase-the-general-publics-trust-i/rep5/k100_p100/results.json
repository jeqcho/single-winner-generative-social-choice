    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014rises when people can see, check, and understand how decisions are made, and when rules are applied consistently and respectfully to everyone. We should set clear baseline standards that protect both access and integrity: secure voter registration and up-to-date rolls; voting options that work for working families, seniors, rural residents, and people with disabilities; and a verifiable record of every ballot (such as voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent audit trails) with strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity. After every election, routine independent audits should be conducted and explained in plain language, with transparent reporting of what went well, what problems occurred, and how they were fixed. Finally, institutions should earn credibility through nonpartisan administration, open data where privacy allows, meaningful opportunities for bipartisan and citizen observation, and ongoing civic education and misinformation response that rely on trusted local messengers rather than political spin.",

At the same time, trust requires broad, fair access: well-staffed and conveniently located polling places, secure early and mail voting with ballot tracking, disability accommodations, and clear information in plain language and multiple languages. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education through schools, libraries, and community organizations so people understand how decisions are made, how safeguards work, and how concerns are addressed\u2014so confidence comes from evidence, not slogans.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared basics: rules that are clear and applied fairly, results that are verifiable, and service that is respectful and accessible to every eligible person. That means using voter-verifiable paper ballots (or an equally auditable record), protecting strict chain-of-custody, strengthening cybersecurity, and conducting routine independent risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language. It also means transparent, nonpartisan administration: welcoming bipartisan and citizen observation, promptly investigating and explaining any irregularities, and holding bad actors accountable without turning administration into partisan warfare. Finally, trust grows when people can understand the system\u2014so we should invest in practical civics education and straightforward, multilingual public communication through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, veterans\u2019 groups, faith and community organizations). By pairing strong integrity safeguards with broad, secure access to voting, institutions can earn confidence through evidence and consistent performance\u2014not slogans.",
