    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared, practical commitments: make decisions and outcomes easy for the public to verify, keep administration independent of partisan pressure, and treat every eligible person with equal respect and access. That means clear rules that are applied consistently, voter options that are both secure and convenient, and routine independent audits with publicly released results and plain-language explanations when problems occur. It also means strong protections against intimidation or interference, sensible identity and eligibility safeguards that don\u2019t block lawful voters, and sustained investment in local offices so the process is well-run everywhere. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often through trusted local partners (schools, community groups, faith organizations, and multilingual messengers), correct misinformation with evidence rather than rhetoric, and create straightforward ways for residents to ask questions, observe appropriate steps, and see how complaints are resolved.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in elections\u2014and in democratic institutions more broadly\u2014we should make the system easy for ordinary people to verify, fair for every eligible voter to use, and consistently administered without partisan advantage. That means relying on voter-verifiable paper ballots (or paper backups), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine independent post-election audits such as risk-limiting audits, and clear, timely public reporting that explains how results were produced and how any discrepancies were resolved. Trust also grows when rules are followed the same way everywhere: maintain accurate voter rolls, set baseline statewide/national standards while allowing local administration, and ensure transparent bipartisan and nonpartisan observation without intimidation or interference. At the same time, we should protect broad access\u2014safe early voting, secure mail options with ballot tracking, disability accommodations, and language access\u2014so integrity and inclusion reinforce each other. Finally, sustained nonpartisan civic education and plain-language communication from trusted local officials and community partners can counter misinformation and help people see the evidence that elections are secure and every vote is counted.",

That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; voter-verifiable paper records or paper backups; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with clear public reporting down to the local level. Access must be secure and practical for real life: straightforward registration, safe early and Election Day voting, secure mail voting with tracking where used, disability accommodations, and language assistance for communities that need it. At the same time, we should invest in ongoing civic education and plain-language communication from trusted local officials and community partners, quickly addressing rumors and mistakes with evidence and accountability. Consistent baseline standards, reliable funding for local offices, and protections against intimidation and partisan interference can help people of different backgrounds and political views feel confident that the system is both inclusive and honest.",
