We should strengthen transparency and accountability through voter-verified records (such as paper ballots or equivalent auditable trails), routine independent post-election audits, secure chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and public reporting that explains results, errors, and fixes in plain language. At the same time, access must be protected with well-staffed polling places, reasonable accommodations for disability and language needs, and convenient, secure options that work for busy voters. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education, open data where it protects privacy, and respectful two-way communication with communities\u2014so concerns are addressed quickly, misinformation has less room to spread, and people can accept outcomes because they can see how the system works.",
