    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is rebuilt when people can see clear rules being followed, results being checked, and leaders being held accountable\u2014regardless of party. We should commit to transparent decision-making (open data, plain-language explanations, and public timelines), strong and independent oversight (regular audits, ethics enforcement, and protections for whistleblowers), and consistent standards that are applied fairly to everyone. At the same time, institutions must be accessible and responsive: reduce bureaucratic barriers, provide multilingual and disability-accessible services, and create trusted local channels\u2014schools, libraries, community groups\u2014for two-way communication and civic education. Finally, we should set shared expectations for integrity online by rapidly correcting misinformation with verifiable evidence, publishing clear corrections when mistakes happen, and enforcing consequences for fraud, corruption, or abuse of power. When institutions are understandable, measurable, and accountable, people don\u2019t have to rely on slogans\u2014they can rely on proof.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014should be earned through clear rules, visible safeguards, and respectful communication that people across the political spectrum can verify for themselves. That means using voter-verifiable paper ballots (or auditable paper records), routine independent risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and transparent reporting that explains results in plain language and shows how questions are investigated and resolved. Administration should be nonpartisan and accountable, with meaningful bipartisan and citizen observation so the process is open without becoming a partisan fight. At the same time, we should keep participation accessible for every eligible voter\u2014safe and well-staffed polling places, early and mail options with clear standards, disability and language access, and timely public information. Finally, sustained civics and media-literacy education through schools, libraries, and trusted community organizations can reduce misinformation and help people judge evidence over rumor, rebuilding confidence that outcomes reflect the will of the voters.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a simple promise: decisions are made fairly, the rules are clear, and anyone can verify the outcome without needing to \u201cjust trust\u201d a party or official. That means transparent, consistently applied procedures; secure, voter-verifiable records (like paper ballots or auditable backups); routine independent audits with published results; and strong protections for cybersecurity, privacy, and chain-of-custody.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions communicate plainly and respectfully, in the languages people actually use, through trusted local channels (schools, libraries, community groups, and local media), and when they respond quickly to problems with facts, not spin. Finally, we should make participation genuinely accessible\u2014reasonable voting options, disability accommodations, and well-run polling places\u2014while enforcing rules evenly and holding fraud, intimidation, and misconduct accountable. When institutions are open, consistent, and accountable, people across backgrounds can disagree on politics while still trusting the process and the results.",
