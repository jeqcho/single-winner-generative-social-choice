    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can clearly see that the rules are fair, the work is competent, and leaders are accountable. A practical middle ground is to make key processes transparent and verifiable without favoring any party: use voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent), conduct routine independent audits with publicly posted results, and maintain strong security and chain-of-custody standards. At the same time, institutions should improve access and service\u2014clear plain-language and multilingual information, reasonable options to vote or participate, and respectful treatment at every step\u2014while protecting civil rights and preventing intimidation. Finally, sustained trust requires consistent, evidence-based communication, open data where privacy allows, and meaningful oversight from a balanced mix of experts, community representatives, and ordinary citizens so that disagreements can be resolved with facts rather than suspicion.",

We should use voter-verified paper ballots (or paper backups), protect systems with strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody procedures, and require independent, nonpartisan risk-limiting audits with publicly posted, plain-language results at the local level. Access also matters: expand convenient early and in-person voting, offer secure mail voting with reliable ballot tracking, and provide multilingual voter information and civics education so every eligible voter understands how to participate. Finally, welcome nonpartisan observers, enforce strong protections against intimidation and partisan interference, and keep communication steady and evidence-based to counter misinformation and reassure the public that every ballot is counted accurately.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should treat them like essential public infrastructure: transparent, verifiable, and accountable to everyone. That means clear, nonpartisan rules; voter-verified paper records where possible; routine independent audits with publicly posted results; strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections; and firm safeguards against intimidation or political interference. Trust also grows when people can see and understand the work, so institutions should publish plain-language explanations of decisions, invite qualified bipartisan/community observers, and make participation accessible through convenient options (early voting, secure mail voting with tracking) and language-access resources. Finally, steady civics education and fast, evidence-based corrections to misinformation\u2014delivered through local leaders, schools, and trusted community organizations\u2014can help people across generations and backgrounds feel confident that the system is fair, understandable, and worthy of their participation.",
