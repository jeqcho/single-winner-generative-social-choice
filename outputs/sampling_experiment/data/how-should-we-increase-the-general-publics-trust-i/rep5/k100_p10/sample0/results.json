    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections increases when people can see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and every eligible voter can participate without unnecessary barriers. A practical middle path is to use voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent auditable trails), publish clear chain-of-custody and security procedures, and conduct routine, independent post-election audits with results reported in plain language. Election offices should communicate early and often\u2014before and after Election Day\u2014through multilingual, accessible materials, public demonstrations of equipment and counting procedures, open data where appropriate, and transparent correction of errors when they occur. Partnering with schools, libraries, and local civic groups for nonpartisan civics education and rapid myth-busting can reduce confusion without censoring debate. With consistent standards, professional administration, and visible accountability, people across communities can be confident outcomes reflect the voters\u2019 choices.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in democratic institutions more broadly\u2014grows when decisions are made through rules that are clear, applied equally, and easy for the public to verify. We should treat election administration as essential public infrastructure: use voter-verifiable paper ballots (or auditable paper records), maintain strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and conduct routine independent, bipartisan risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language. At the same time, voting should be accessible to every eligible voter through well-resourced polling places and convenient, secure options that protect privacy. Finally, consistent, nonpartisan communication and civic education\u2014delivered through trusted local partners and in multiple languages\u2014can reduce confusion, correct misinformation, and help communities see for themselves that outcomes are accurate and fair.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, in practical and everyday ways, that the rules are fair, the work is competent, and leaders are accountable. We should make decisions and results easy to verify\u2014through clear public standards, independent oversight and audits, open meetings and records when possible, and straightforward explanations in plain language. Institutions must deliver reliable service for all communities (shorter waits, consistent enforcement, respectful treatment), protect privacy and civil liberties, and correct mistakes quickly with honest, public reporting. Just as important, we should invest in civic education and partnerships with local groups\u2014schools, libraries, veterans\u2019 and faith organizations, labor and business groups\u2014so accurate information travels through trusted messengers and misinformation is addressed with facts, not insults. When institutions show their work, apply rules equally, and listen to people\u2019s lived experience, confidence can be rebuilt across political and cultural lines.",
