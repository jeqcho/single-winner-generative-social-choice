Institutions should invite credible oversight from across the spectrum\u2014inspectors general, bipartisan or multipartisan review panels, courts, journalists, and community representatives\u2014while protecting privacy and security.

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on rules and services that people can see, verify, and experience as fair in everyday life. That means transparent, consistently applied procedures; secure, auditable records (such as voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent auditable trails); routine independent risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language; and strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections that safeguard privacy. At the same time, institutions must make participation and access straightforward\u2014reliable registration and roll maintenance, well-staffed and convenient service locations, reasonable anti-fraud safeguards that don\u2019t block eligible people, and clear options for working families, seniors, and people with disabilities. Trust also grows when officials communicate calmly and nonpartisanly, correct mistakes quickly, welcome bipartisan and community observers, and provide multilingual, easy-to-understand information through schools, libraries, faith groups, and trusted local organizations. When institutions pair verifiable accountability with respectful, inclusive service, more people\u2014across backgrounds and political views\u2014can accept outcomes, feel heard, and rebuild confidence that the system works for everyone.",
