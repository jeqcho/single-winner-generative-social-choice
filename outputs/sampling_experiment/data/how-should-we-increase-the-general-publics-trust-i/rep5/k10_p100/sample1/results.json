    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, fair treatment, and real accountability in practice. We should adopt baseline, consistently applied standards that protect both access and integrity: secure voting with a voter-verifiable record, strong chain-of-custody, routine independent audits, and transparent public reporting of results and any problems found. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan, with bipartisan and citizen observers and clear consequences for fraud, intimidation, or interference. Just as important, institutions should communicate early and often in plain language and multiple languages, publish understandable data and explanations (not slogans), and invest in ongoing civic education and local community partnerships so people feel respected, informed, and confident that outcomes are verified and legitimate\u2014even when their side loses.",

That means voter-verified paper ballots or equally auditable records, routine risk-limiting audits, secure chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and independent oversight with bipartisan and nonpartisan observers. Institutions should communicate clearly and promptly in plain language (and multiple languages where needed), publish audit methods and results, and openly explain how concerns or irregularities are investigated and corrected. At the same time, we should protect broad, fair access\u2014well-staffed polling places, accessible options for disabled voters, and convenient early or secure mail voting\u2014paired with strong civics education and trusted community partnerships to counter misinformation. When institutions show their work, follow predictable rules, and treat people with respect, trust can be earned across political and cultural lines.",

When institutions are transparent, accountable, and inclusive\u2014while protecting privacy and equal rights\u2014more people across backgrounds can feel confident that the system works for them and is worthy of their trust.",
