We should use voting systems that are secure and verifiable (including paper records where feasible), follow strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity practices, and conduct routine, publicly reported audits with independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight. At the same time, voting should be accessible and respectful for all eligible voters through clear procedures, reliable polling operations, and practical options that meet community needs. Finally, institutions must communicate in plain, multilingual language before and after elections\u2014explaining how safeguards work, correcting misinformation with evidence, and acknowledging problems and fixes quickly\u2014so confidence is built through transparency, accountability, and service rather than slogans.",

That means using secure, auditable systems with verifiable paper records where possible; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; routine risk-limiting audits; and independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with trained observers.

Finally, trust grows when the public is treated with respect and services are accessible\u2014through reliable polling options, accommodations for busy families and people with disabilities, and ongoing civics education that helps communities understand and engage with the process.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on things people can see, check, and experience as fair. That means clear, consistent rules; secure systems with verifiable paper records; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine, independent post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) with results published in plain language. Oversight should be nonpartisan and transparent, with meaningful access for accredited observers and prompt public explanations of mistakes and fixes. Trust also depends on equal access and respectful service: safe polling places, reasonable hours, accessible voting options, and multilingual information so busy families, seniors, rural voters, and Spanish\u2011speaking communities can participate confidently. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education and proactive communication to counter misinformation\u2014sharing how safeguards work before Election Day, not only after controversies arise\u2014so people across backgrounds can verify outcomes and feel the system treats everyone fairly.",
