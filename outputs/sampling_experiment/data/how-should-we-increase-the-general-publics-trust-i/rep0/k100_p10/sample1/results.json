    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can clearly see that the same rules apply to everyone, that outcomes can be independently verified, and that leaders admit and fix mistakes. For elections, that means using auditable paper records where feasible, routine independent post-election audits, strong cybersecurity, and transparent public reporting that explains in plain language how ballots are cast, counted, and certified. It also means investing in well-trained, nonpartisan election staff; consistent standards across jurisdictions; and broad access that serves working families, seniors, people with disabilities, rural communities, and language minorities. Finally, institutions should earn trust through ongoing civic education, open data and open meetings, and rapid, evidence-based responses to misinformation\u2014so confidence is built on verifiable facts rather than on partisan claims.",

We should use transparent, consistently applied procedures: voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent auditable records, independent risk-limiting audits, strong cybersecurity, and clear standards across jurisdictions.

At the same time, institutions should invest in civic education and community-based outreach (including schools, trusted local messengers, and accessible materials) and protect the public from intimidation and misinformation so everyone\u2014including people with disabilities, seniors, and busy families\u2014can participate confidently and feel respected.",

That means clear, uniform rules; nonpartisan administration; paper-based or voter-verifiable records; routine independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits); and strong cybersecurity with public reporting that explains what protections exist and what was tested. Trust also grows when institutions communicate promptly and plainly\u2014sharing data, timelines, and explanations when problems occur\u2014while protecting privacy and safety and enforcing consequences for intimidation, corruption, or misconduct. Finally, we should invest in broad civic education and multilingual, accessible outreach (including for people with disabilities and for communities who have historically been overlooked), and support locally trusted staff and community partners so the public can see\u2014not just be told\u2014that the system is transparent, accountable, and worthy of confidence.",
