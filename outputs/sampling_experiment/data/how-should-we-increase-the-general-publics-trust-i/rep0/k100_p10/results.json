That means using secure, voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent), routine independent audits, and strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, with bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight and public reporting of results and any corrections. Trust also grows when access is fair and practical for everyone: safe and well-run polling places, reasonable voting options, and strong accommodations for disabilities, along with multilingual information so families can understand each step. Finally, institutions and media should commit to plain-language communication, timely transparency when mistakes happen, and ongoing civics and media-literacy education in schools and communities to reduce misinformation and help people see how decisions are made and accountability is enforced.",
