    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when institutions earn it through visible competence, equal treatment, and honest communication. We should use voting systems that are easy to verify (such as paper records and routine, publicly reported audits), with clear custody and security standards that protect both accuracy and voter privacy. Election rules should be consistent and well-explained, while still allowing practical flexibility for local needs, and oversight should include representatives from multiple parties plus independent experts. Just as important, officials should communicate quickly in plain language (and in widely used local languages), admit mistakes when they occur, and provide ways for the public and media to observe, ask questions, and resolve disputes transparently. Finally, expand access for eligible voters\u2014without lowering safeguards\u2014by funding local election offices, keeping polling places accessible, and partnering with trusted community organizations to share reliable information and reduce misinformation.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014grows when people can see, verify, and understand that decisions are made fairly and competently. We should use transparent, auditable processes (including paper records, routine risk-limiting audits, and independent review), apply clear and consistent rules, and fund frontline offices so systems work reliably. Institutions should communicate in plain language with timely, factual updates, publish audit results and performance data, and protect privacy and cybersecurity. Access must be barrier-free for every eligible person, including seniors, people with disabilities, and multilingual communities, with convenient options like early voting and vote-by-mail where appropriate. Finally, we should partner with trusted local voices\u2014schools, libraries, community and faith-based organizations\u2014to expand civic education and rapidly correct misinformation with evidence, so disagreements are settled by transparent facts rather than suspicion.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared, practical commitments: make decisions and results transparent and verifiable; keep rules and enforcement fair and consistent; communicate in plain, timely, multilingual language; and invite independent oversight so accountability is real.\n\nFor elections, that means paper-based records (or auditable paper trails), routine risk-limiting audits with results posted publicly, strong cybersecurity and privacy protections, and clear, nonpartisan explanations of how ballots are cast, stored, counted, and recounted. It also means adequate funding for local offices and frontline workers, uniform minimum standards across jurisdictions where feasible, and accessible voting options (in-person, early, mail, and accommodations for seniors and people with disabilities) so eligible voters can participate without unnecessary barriers.\n\nAcross institutions more broadly, trust grows when leaders admit mistakes, publish performance metrics, enforce ethics rules consistently, and partner with trusted community messengers\u2014schools, libraries, faith and civic groups, and local media\u2014to counter misinformation with evidence people can check for themselves. The goal is not asking for blind trust, but earning it through clear proof, equal treatment, and responsive service.",
