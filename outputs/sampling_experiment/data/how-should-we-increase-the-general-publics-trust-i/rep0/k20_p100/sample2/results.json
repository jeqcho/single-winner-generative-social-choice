    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability. A practical middle ground is to strengthen transparency and verification (voter-verifiable records, strong chain-of-custody, and routine independent audits), while keeping voting accessible through well-run polling places, secure mail/early options where used, and reliable accommodations for disability and language needs. Institutions should publish plain-language explanations and open data about procedures, budgets, and audit results; promptly investigate and report problems; and enforce consequences for fraud, intimidation, or interference. Finally, sustained civics and media-literacy education\u2014delivered through schools, libraries, and trusted community organizations\u2014can help people understand how decisions are made and how to check facts, so confidence is earned through evidence rather than partisanship.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in our elections, we should focus on processes that are easy to verify, consistently administered, and clearly explained\u2014so people don\u2019t have to rely on rumors or partisan claims. That means voter-verified paper ballots (or an equivalent auditable record), strict chain-of-custody procedures, and routine independent risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language and open to bipartisan and community observation. We should pair strong cybersecurity and prompt investigation of any irregularities with calm, factual communication from election officials about what happened and how it was resolved. Trust also depends on fair access: reliable polling places, secure options like early voting and mail-in voting with clear safeguards, accommodations for disabilities, and multilingual information so every eligible voter can participate confidently. Finally, sustained civics and media-literacy education\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations\u2014can help communities understand how elections work and recognize misinformation, so confidence is earned through transparency, accountability, and inclusion.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on practices that are easy to see, easy to verify, and fair to everyone, regardless of party or background. That means clear, consistent rules; nonpartisan administration with bipartisan and independent oversight; and verifiable records (such as voter\u2011verified paper ballots or equivalent) backed by routine, publicly reported audits. Institutions should communicate in plain language, on time, and in multiple languages where needed, explaining not just outcomes but how decisions were made, what safeguards exist, and how problems are investigated and corrected. Trust also grows when access is practical and respectful of real life: safe and welcoming public-facing services, reasonable hours, disability accommodations, and secure options like early voting or mail voting with transparent safeguards. Finally, invest in civic education and media literacy through schools, libraries, and trusted community organizations, and hold officials accountable for accuracy, integrity, and responsiveness\u2014because confidence is earned when people can understand the process, see the checks, and feel included.",
