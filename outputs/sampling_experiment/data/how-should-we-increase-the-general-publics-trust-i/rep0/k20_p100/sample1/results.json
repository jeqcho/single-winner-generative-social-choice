    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and verify how decisions are made\u2014and when the rules apply fairly to everyone. We should strengthen transparency with clear public standards, open data where appropriate, and independent oversight that regularly audits performance and investigates problems promptly, with findings explained in plain language. Institutions should protect privacy and security while expanding accessibility\u2014through multilingual communication, disability accommodations, and reliable ways for residents to ask questions and get timely answers. Finally, investing in civic education and media literacy, and setting clear consequences for misconduct or deliberate misinformation, can help rebuild confidence that institutions serve the public interest rather than partisan or private agendas.",

That means using verifiable records (such as paper ballots or voter\u2011verified backups), enforcing strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody and strong cybersecurity, and conducting routine independent, bipartisan audits with findings published promptly in plain language and open data formats. Institutions should also communicate calmly and transparently when problems occur\u2014what happened, what was fixed, and how it will be prevented\u2014so accountability is visible rather than assumed. Trust grows when access is fair and practical for real life: reliable polling places, reasonable hours, secure early and mail options with clear safeguards, and accommodations for disabilities and language needs, including multilingual materials for Spanish- and Asian\u2011language communities. Finally, sustained civics and media\u2011literacy education through schools, libraries, and community organizations can reduce misinformation and help people of all backgrounds understand how decisions are made and how oversight works. When institutions are transparent, audited, inclusive, and responsive, confidence is earned across political and cultural lines.",
