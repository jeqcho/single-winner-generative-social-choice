That means clear, consistent rules; strong safeguards against fraud and hacking; and routine independent audits with an auditable record (such as voter-verified paper backups) so results can be checked and explained. It also means making participation practical and fair\u2014accessible polling places, reasonable accommodations, and timely, plain-language information in formats and languages communities actually use. Finally, institutions should earn confidence by showing their work: publish data and decisions, admit and fix mistakes quickly, welcome bipartisan and public observation, and invest in civics and media literacy so people can tell the difference between evidence and rumor.",
