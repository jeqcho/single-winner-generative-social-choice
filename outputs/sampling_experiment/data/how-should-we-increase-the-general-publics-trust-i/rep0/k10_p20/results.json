    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and get honest accountability when things go wrong. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity safeguards (clear standards, independent oversight, and routine audits with publicly posted findings) with broad, barrier-free access (plain-language, multilingual information; accommodations for disabilities; and reliable, well-funded local services). Institutions should publish transparent data and explanations without partisan framing, invite structured public observation and feedback, and correct errors quickly with documented fixes. Finally, sustained civic education and media literacy\u2014delivered through schools, libraries, and trusted community groups\u2014can reduce misinformation and help people understand what is happening and why, making trust based on evidence rather than slogans.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in U.S. elections, we should focus on reforms people can see, verify, and understand\u2014while keeping voting secure and accessible for every eligible citizen. That means using voter-verified paper ballots (or auditable paper backups), conducting routine independent risk-limiting audits, and publishing clear, plain-language results and audit reports on a consistent schedule. Elections should be administered in a transparently nonpartisan way with bipartisan/community oversight, strong cybersecurity, and well-trained, adequately funded local election offices.\n\nTrust also grows when participation is straightforward and fair: accessible polling places, reasonable accommodations for disabilities, and timely multilingual voter information. Finally, sustained civics education, media literacy, and proactive, fact-based public communication\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted community organizations\u2014can reduce misinformation and help the public understand how votes are cast, counted, and certified.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on the same basics people trust in any system: clear rules, consistent service, and proof that the rules are followed. That means using voter-verified paper ballots (or paper backups), routine independent post\u2011election audits, strong cybersecurity, and transparent, plain\u2011language public reporting of how votes are processed, counted, and certified. Trust also grows when participation is fair and practical, so polling places should be safe and well-run, with reasonable, consistently applied security checks, and accessible options for seniors, people with disabilities, students, and working families. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often through schools, libraries, community groups, and local media\u2014teaching civics and media literacy, sharing nonpartisan facts, and correcting misinformation with evidence\u2014so people can see for themselves how integrity and accountability are maintained.",
