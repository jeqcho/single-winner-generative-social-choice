    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, competently, and with real accountability. A practical middle ground is to set clear, nonpartisan rules; make key processes transparent and independently verifiable (e.g., auditable records, routine independent reviews, and publicly posted procedures); and communicate results and decisions in plain, timely language that addresses questions directly. Trust also depends on equal, reasonable access for all eligible participants (including accommodations for disability and language needs) without weakening security, along with strong protections for privacy and consistent enforcement of rules. Finally, institutions should invite community oversight\u2014bipartisan observers, open meetings where appropriate, and responsive complaint channels\u2014while investing in civic education and misinformation-resistance so people can evaluate claims using evidence rather than rumor.",

That includes voter-verified paper ballots (or paper backups), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine risk-limiting post\u2011election audits, and open observation with clear rules that protect voter privacy. Election officials should communicate in plain, timely language\u2014how ballots are cast, counted, audited, and certified\u2014and correct misinformation with evidence and public data. At the same time, access must be reliable for every eligible voter: well-run polling places with reasonable hours, safe early voting and secure mail options, and accommodations for disabilities and language needs. Investing in trained local election staff, independent oversight, and practical civic education can help communities see that the process is fair, accountable, and worthy of confidence.",
