    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections increases when people can verify that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and access is practical for every eligible voter. A durable middle ground is to standardize core safeguards nationwide while keeping local administration: voter-verified paper records (or equivalent), transparent chain-of-custody, bipartisan and independent observation, and routine risk-limiting audits with plain-language public reports. At the same time, we should make participation straightforward\u2014reliable early and in-person options, secure and trackable mail voting where offered, and strong accommodations for disability and language needs\u2014so security measures don\u2019t become barriers. When problems occur, officials should investigate quickly, publish what happened and how it was fixed, and correct misinformation with consistent, nonpartisan communication through trusted community institutions like schools, libraries, and local organizations. Trust is earned by showing the work, applying rules consistently, and respecting both integrity and inclusion.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on processes people can see, verify, and understand, while protecting equal access and the rule of law. That means using voter-verifiable paper records (or equivalent auditable records), strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent risk-limiting audits with bipartisan observer access. Institutions should apply clear, consistent rules, keep voter rolls accurate, and use reasonable identity and eligibility checks that are secure without creating unnecessary barriers. Just as important, officials must communicate promptly and calmly in plain language (and multiple languages where needed), publish audit results and explanations of any problems and fixes, and invest in ongoing civics and media-literacy education through schools, libraries, and trusted community organizations. Trust grows when accountability is proven in public, misinformation is corrected with transparent evidence, and every eligible person can participate with confidence that outcomes are fair and verifiable.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on steps that are transparent, verifiable, and fair to people of different backgrounds and viewpoints. That means using voting systems with a voter-verifiable paper record, maintaining clear chain-of-custody rules, and conducting routine, independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results published in plain language. Election administration should be professional and nonpartisan, with meaningful bipartisan and community observation, consistent procedures across jurisdictions where practical, and prompt, public explanations when mistakes occur and how they were corrected.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions are accessible and responsive: expand practical voting options (secure in-person, early, and mail options with clear safeguards), ensure polling places are safe from intimidation, and provide strong accommodations for seniors, people with disabilities, and voters who need information in languages beyond English. Finally, we should invest in ongoing civics and media-literacy education and maintain reliable, easy-to-find official information channels\u2014so families can understand the process, distinguish facts from rumors, and feel confident that every eligible voter can participate and that every lawful vote is counted accurately.",
