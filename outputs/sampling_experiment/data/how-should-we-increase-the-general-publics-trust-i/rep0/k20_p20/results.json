    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, competently, and with real accountability. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity safeguards (clear rules, secure chain-of-custody, paper records or equivalent auditable trails, routine independent audits, and open observation by multiple parties) with broad, equal access (convenient voting options, accommodations for disabilities, and multilingual, plain-language information). Institutions should communicate quickly and transparently\u2014publishing what happened, what went wrong, and how issues were fixed\u2014while protecting privacy and preventing intimidation. Finally, trust is built locally: adequately fund frontline offices, recruit and train diverse community members to serve, and create easy, nonpartisan ways for the public to ask questions and verify claims without relying on partisan media.",

We should strengthen nonpartisan administration and bipartisan/independent oversight; use auditable systems with a voter-verifiable paper record; enforce clear chain-of-custody and security standards; and conduct routine, publicly reported post\u2011election audits (including risk\u2011limiting audits where feasible). Just as important, we should make voting accessible and consistent\u2014safe polling places, options like early and mail voting with clear safeguards, accommodations for seniors and people with disabilities, and reliable language access\u2014so participation is straightforward for all communities. Finally, election offices need adequate funding and plain\u2011language, timely communication (through trusted local partners like libraries, schools, and community groups) to answer questions, publish transparent data, and counter misinformation with verifiable facts.",

Institutions should communicate early and often\u2014quickly correcting errors, distinguishing facts from opinions, and explaining uncertainty when it exists\u2014while protecting privacy and security. Trust also grows when services are reliable and fair in everyday life: responsive local offices, easy-to-use processes, language access (including Spanish), and community partnerships with libraries, schools, and trusted local organizations so people can ask questions and be heard. When institutions are transparent, consistently competent, and accountable to the communities they serve, confidence can be earned across political and cultural lines.",
