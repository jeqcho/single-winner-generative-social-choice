    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when rules are clear, outcomes are independently verifiable, and the public is treated with respect regardless of party or background. A strong middle-ground approach is to ensure every jurisdiction uses secure systems with a voter-verifiable record (such as paper ballots or equivalent), publishes transparent chain-of-custody and security procedures, and conducts routine, independent post-election audits whose results are released quickly in plain language. Oversight should be balanced and accountable (e.g., bipartisan observation plus nonpartisan professional administration), with consistent baseline standards across states while allowing practical local implementation. At the same time, institutions should make participation straightforward\u2014accessible polling and ballot options, accommodations for disabilities, and multilingual support\u2014while maintaining sensible safeguards like accurate voter rolls and fair identity verification that does not block eligible voters. Finally, trust increases when officials communicate early and often, correct mistakes openly, share data where appropriate, and partner with trusted community messengers to counter misinformation without partisan spin.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules and results easier to verify, easier to understand, and consistently applied. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; clear statewide and cross-state standards; auditable systems with a voter-verifiable paper record; robust post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits) with results published promptly in plain language; and strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections. Trust also grows when participation is both secure and accessible: accurate voter rolls, secure voter registration, reasonable identity verification options that don\u2019t block eligible voters, and voting options that work for seniors, people with disabilities, and busy families. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often\u2014multilingual where needed\u2014invite bipartisan and community observation, openly acknowledge and fix errors, and counter misinformation with factual, evidence-based public education so people can see that every eligible vote counts and the process is fair.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easier for everyday people to verify, and harder for anyone to manipulate or hide. That means transparent rules that are applied consistently, independent and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight, and routine public audits with clear, plain-language reporting. In elections specifically, widely usable verifiable ballot records (such as paper ballots), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and risk-limiting post-election audits should be standard, with observers allowed and findings published quickly along with any fixes.\n\nTrust also depends on fairness and access: voting and public services should be secure but not needlessly difficult, with accommodations for seniors and people with disabilities and information available in multiple languages where needed. Institutions should invest in civics and public education, open data and dashboards that show how decisions are made, and regular community forums that allow people to ask questions and be heard. Finally, trust grows when leaders are accountable\u2014errors are acknowledged and corrected transparently, and deliberate, provably false claims that undermine public confidence are answered promptly with evidence and, when appropriate, consequences.",
