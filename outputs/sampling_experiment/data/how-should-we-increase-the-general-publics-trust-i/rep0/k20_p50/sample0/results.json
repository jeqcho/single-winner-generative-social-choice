    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear, consistent rules applied fairly, and when independent checks make the results provable rather than just promised. A practical middle ground is to pair strong safeguards (auditable paper records or equivalent, secure chain-of-custody, robust cybersecurity, and routine independent risk\u2011limiting audits with bipartisan observation) with wide, lawful access (reasonable early and mail options with clear verification, accessible polling places and hours, and accommodations for disability and language needs). Institutions should publish plain\u2011language explanations, timely data, and transparent reports on errors and how they were corrected, while investing in local offices, well-trained workers, and year\u2011round civics education through schools, libraries, and trusted community groups. When oversight is real, communication is honest, and participation is straightforward, confidence can be earned across partisan and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy to verify, easy to understand, and applied consistently. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; clear standards that are enforced the same way across jurisdictions; and verifiable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent backups) with routine independent audits like risk-limiting audits, published promptly in plain language. Security and access should be balanced: accurate voter rolls, strong cybersecurity, safe polling places, and practical voting options (early in-person and secure absentee/mail with clear safeguards) so eligible voters can participate without confusion. Institutions should also communicate quickly and calmly about problems and fixes, welcome bipartisan and community observation, and invest in ongoing civics education and trusted local partnerships (libraries, schools, faith and community groups) to counter misinformation with documented facts. Trust grows when people can see the rules, see them followed, and see proof that the system works.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on four shared commitments: transparency people can see, accountability that is independently verified, fair access for every eligible person, and calm, consistent communication.\n\nThat means using verifiable records (like auditable paper ballots or equivalent), enforcing strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and conducting routine independent post\u2011election audits with results published in plain language so any reasonable person can understand what was checked and what was found. Oversight should be nonpartisan and include meaningful, rules-based observation by representatives from multiple parties and community stakeholders.\n\nTrust also depends on institutions serving people\u2019s real lives: accessible polling places and hours, clear registration and voting instructions, accommodations for disability and language needs, and well-trained, adequately funded frontline staff. Finally, institutions should respond to errors or irregularities quickly and openly\u2014explaining what happened, what was corrected, and what safeguards prevented bigger problems\u2014while partnering with schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations to provide factual civic education and counter misinformation without partisan spin.",
