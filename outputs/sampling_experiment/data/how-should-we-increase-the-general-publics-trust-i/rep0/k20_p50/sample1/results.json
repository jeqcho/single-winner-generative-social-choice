    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014rises when people can clearly see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and mistakes are handled openly. A workable middle ground is to pair strong, consistent safeguards (verifiable records such as paper ballots or equivalent, strict chain-of-custody, routine independent risk-limiting audits, and robust cybersecurity) with broad, practical access (reliable polling places, secure early and mail options where offered, and accommodations for disability and language). Institutions should publish timely, plain-language reports on procedures, audit results, and any problems found and fixed, and they should welcome bipartisan and community observation without turning administration into a partisan fight. Finally, sustained civics and media-literacy education\u2014delivered through schools, libraries, and trusted local groups\u2014can help people understand what protections exist and spot misinformation, so confidence is earned through transparency, accountability, and respectful service to every eligible participant.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on reforms people can see, understand, and independently verify. That means transparent, consistently applied rules; nonpartisan and bipartisan oversight; auditable paper ballots or equivalent voter-verifiable records; strict chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity; and routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results published in plain language and open data where feasible. Trust also grows when participation is both secure and practical: accessible polling places and hours, secure early and mail options with clear safeguards, well-trained election workers, and reasonable identity and voter-roll protections that prevent fraud without disenfranchising eligible voters. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and honestly when problems occur\u2014what happened, what was fixed, and how it will be prevented\u2014while investing in ongoing civics and media literacy education and multilingual community outreach through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations to counter misinformation and help every community feel respected and included.",
