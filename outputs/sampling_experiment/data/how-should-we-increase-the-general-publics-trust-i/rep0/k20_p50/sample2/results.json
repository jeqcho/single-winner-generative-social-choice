    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability, regardless of which party wins. We should adopt transparent, verifiable systems with auditable records (such as paper backups or equivalent verifiable ballot records), routine independent post\u2011election audits with results published in plain language, and strong cybersecurity and physical security for workers and polling places. Access should be reliable and fair: convenient in\u2011person options with reasonable hours, secure absentee or mail voting with clear safeguards, and practical identity and eligibility checks that protect both ballot access and ballot integrity without creating unnecessary barriers. When problems occur, officials should investigate promptly, report what happened, and explain what changed\u2014using nonpartisan, multilingual communication and open public observation\u2014so confidence is earned through evidence, not rhetoric.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in elections\u2014and in the institutions that run them\u2014we should make the system easy to verify, hard to tamper with, and clearly explained. That means using paper ballots or voter\u2011verifiable paper records, maintaining a strict chain of custody, and conducting routine independent post\u2011election audits (including risk\u2011limiting audits) with results published promptly in plain language and open data formats. Election administration should be professional and nonpartisan, with bipartisan observer access and consistent, transparent procedures across jurisdictions.\n\nTrust also depends on access and respect: safe, well\u2011run polling places; reasonable hours; secure options for early and mail voting with clear safeguards; strong protections against intimidation; and accessible, multilingual information so every eligible voter can participate confidently. Finally, institutions should invest in year\u2011round civics and media\u2011literacy education through schools, libraries, and trusted community partners, and respond quickly and factually to errors or rumors by explaining what happened, what was checked, and how it was fixed. When people can see the safeguards, understand the process, and verify outcomes, confidence follows\u2014even when their side loses.",
