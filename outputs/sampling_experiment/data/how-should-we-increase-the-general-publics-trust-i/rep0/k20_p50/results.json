    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and honest accountability. A durable middle ground is to pair strong, verifiable safeguards (a reliable auditable record such as paper or voter-verifiable backups, strict chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and meaningful bipartisan/public observation) with practical access for eligible voters (secure mail and early voting options, well-run polling places, disability and language accommodations, and adequately trained, well-funded local administrators). Institutions should publish timely, plain-language explanations of procedures, results, errors, and fixes, and commit to rapid, independent review of credible complaints. Finally, ongoing civics education and partnerships with trusted community groups can reduce misinformation and help people understand\u2014not just assume\u2014that the system is fair and working.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in U.S. elections, we should focus on a process that regular people can see, understand, and verify\u2014without favoring either party. That means using verifiable paper ballots (or an equivalent voter-verifiable paper record), strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent post\u2011election audits (including risk\u2011limiting audits) with results published promptly in plain language. Elections should be administered by professional, nonpartisan officials with real bipartisan observer access at key steps, clear rules applied consistently, and transparent, timely explanations when problems occur and how they are corrected. At the same time, we should keep voting accessible for every eligible voter through reliable polling places and reasonable options like early and mail voting with clear safeguards, alongside sustained civics and community education\u2014through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations, including multilingual outreach\u2014to counter misinformation and help people feel confident that every legal vote counts and is counted accurately.",

Second, strengthen nonpartisan oversight and consistent rules: professional administrators, bipartisan/independent observers with real access, uniform procedures where possible, and prompt, lawful investigation of credible complaints.\n\nThird, communicate like a public service: timely updates, simple explanations, open data dashboards, and multilingual, low\u2011jargon materials delivered through trusted local channels (libraries, schools, community and faith organizations). Finally, protect both access and security: convenient options that fit working schedules and disabilities, strong cybersecurity and privacy protections, and well\u2011trained, well\u2011resourced front\u2011line staff so the experience is orderly and respectful.\n\nTrust grows when institutions do the basics well, show their work, correct errors openly, and treat every community with equal dignity\u2014so people don\u2019t have to rely on rumors to know the system is functioning.",
