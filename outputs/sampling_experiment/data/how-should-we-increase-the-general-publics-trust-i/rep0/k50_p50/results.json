    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and verify how decisions are made and how problems are fixed. A practical middle ground is to strengthen transparency and accountability without sacrificing access: use verifiable voting records with strong chain-of-custody, conduct routine independent audits and publish the methods and results in plain language, and ensure bipartisan and community observation rules that are clear and consistently applied. At the same time, make participation workable for real life by offering secure options like early voting and well-designed mail voting, along with multilingual, disability-accessible information and well-trained front-line staff. When officials communicate quickly about issues, correct mistakes openly, protect privacy, and build long-term civics and media literacy through schools and trusted community partners, confidence is earned across political lines\u2014even when outcomes disappoint some voters.",

We should use voting systems with a clear, auditable record (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), maintain strict chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity, and conduct routine, independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits) with findings reported quickly in plain language. Election administration should be nonpartisan and transparent, with meaningful access for bipartisan observers and clear procedures that are applied consistently while respecting state and local control. At the same time, voting should remain accessible for eligible voters\u2014through well-run polling places and secure options like early voting and mail voting with clear safeguards. Finally, sustained civics and media-literacy education, multilingual voter information, and prompt, factual responses to misinformation and irregularities can help families and communities feel informed, respected, and confident in the process.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the rules and results easy to verify, easy to understand, and applied consistently and fairly. That means using systems with a verifiable record (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records), strong chain-of-custody safeguards, routine independent post\u2011election audits with publicly posted findings, and clear processes for investigating and correcting errors. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and transparent, with meaningful access for bipartisan observers and the public while protecting voter privacy and safety.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions communicate like good public servants: timely updates, plain-language explanations, and open reporting of both successes and problems\u2014paired with real accountability when officials or influential actors knowingly spread false information. Finally, we should strengthen civics and media\u2011literacy education and provide multilingual, accessible information and voting options (including accommodations for disability and work schedules), so every eligible person can participate confidently and see how decisions are made. When people can see the safeguards, understand the process, and witness fair treatment across communities, trust is earned and sustained.",
