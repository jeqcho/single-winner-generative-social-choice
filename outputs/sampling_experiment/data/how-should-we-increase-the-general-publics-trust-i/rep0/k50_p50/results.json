    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can clearly see how decisions are made, how rules are applied, and how mistakes are corrected. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, verifiable safeguards (a paper or otherwise voter-verifiable record, secure chain of custody, robust cybersecurity, and routine independent post-election audits) with broad, fair access to voting (reasonable accommodations for disability, reliable multilingual information, and voting options that fit real work and family schedules). Oversight should be meaningfully nonpartisan\u2014using bipartisan observation, professional standards for election administrators, and public reporting that is timely, plain-language, and specific about what was checked and what was found. Finally, institutions should invest in year-round civic and media literacy education, rapid correction of misinformation with evidence, and clear accountability when officials or systems fail, so confidence is earned through transparency, consistency, and respect for every eligible voter.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on transparency people can see, rules that are applied consistently, and accountability that is clearly nonpartisan. That means using voting systems with a verifiable paper record (or equivalent voter-verifiable records), maintaining strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and conducting routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits) with public, plain-language reports of what was checked, what was found, and how issues were corrected. Institutions should also improve accessibility and fairness by offering clear, multilingual information, accommodations for disabilities, and practical voting options that fit real lives, while protecting privacy and preventing intimidation. Finally, sustained civics and media-literacy education, plus timely, factual communication from officials and trusted local messengers, can reduce misinformation and help people understand\u2014not just hear\u2014that results and decisions are earned through transparent, verifiable processes.",

Institutions should communicate early and often\u2014admitting mistakes, explaining corrections, and providing information in the languages and formats communities use\u2014while building long-term civics and media literacy so people can recognize misinformation. Finally, trust grows when people are treated with respect at the \u201cfront desk\u201d of government and public services: trained staff, predictable timelines, accessible options for working families, seniors, and people with disabilities, and real opportunities for community input before major policies are set.",
