    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when they consistently earn it through competence, fairness, and openness\u2014while respecting people\u2019s rights and differences. A practical middle ground is to set clear, publicly understandable standards for how key decisions are made, how money is spent, and how performance is measured, then publish results in plain language and multiple languages, with accessible formats for people with disabilities.\n\nTrust also depends on real accountability: independent inspectors general, auditors, and ombuds offices with the authority and resources to investigate complaints, protect whistleblowers, and report findings publicly\u2014paired with consequences for proven misconduct and a credible process to correct errors. At the same time, institutions should invest in better service delivery (shorter wait times, simpler forms, reliable digital tools with privacy safeguards) and consistent, nonpartisan communication that explains what is known, what is uncertain, and how the public can verify claims.\n\nFinally, rebuilding trust requires two-way engagement\u2014regular town halls, community advisory boards, and partnerships with trusted local organizations\u2014so people feel heard, policies reflect lived realities, and institutions become more transparent, responsive, and worthy of confidence over time.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in our elections, we should make the entire process transparent, verifiable, and easy for everyday people to understand\u2014without favoring any party. That means using auditable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), enforcing strict ballot chain-of-custody, and conducting routine independent, publicly reported risk-limiting post\u2011election audits so results can be checked and confirmed. Election administration should be professional and nonpartisan, with bipartisan and community oversight, strong cybersecurity, and clear rules applied consistently.\n\nTrust also depends on access and communication: provide safe, accessible voting options (including well-run in-person voting, early voting, and secure mail options where used), accommodations for disabilities, and clear multilingual, plain-language guidance on how voting, counting, and certification work. Finally, election officials should communicate promptly and factually, investigate credible issues openly, and invest in ongoing civics education and media literacy through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations so misinformation has less room to grow and more voters can participate with confidence.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on three practical commitments: transparency people can see, accountability that is independently verified, and access that is fair to everyone. That means clear, consistent rules; secure records with a verifiable paper trail (or equivalent auditable record); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; routine independent, publicly reported audits; and prompt, plain-language explanations of what happened, what was checked, and what would trigger a recount or investigation. Trust also grows when institutions meet communities where they are: multilingual information, disability accommodations, flexible ways to participate, well-trained nonpartisan staff, and partnerships with trusted local messengers like schools, libraries, veterans\u2019 groups, workplaces, and faith/community organizations\u2014without partisan advocacy. Finally, institutions should publish accessible data, correct mistakes openly, and consistently enforce consequences for fraud, intimidation, or deliberate deception, so confidence is earned through reliable performance rather than demanded through rhetoric.",
