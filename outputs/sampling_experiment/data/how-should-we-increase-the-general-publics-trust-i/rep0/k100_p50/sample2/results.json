    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see that rules are fair, applied consistently, and enforced without favoritism. We should strengthen transparency and accountability by using voting systems with a verifiable record, routine independent audits with publicly posted plain-language results, and clear chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards. At the same time, we should protect broad, lawful participation with accessible polling places, reasonable early voting options, and secure absentee or mail voting where used\u2014paired with common-sense identity and eligibility checks that don\u2019t create unnecessary barriers. Institutions should also communicate quickly and honestly when problems occur, explain what changed and why, and work with trusted local partners (schools, libraries, faith and community groups) to provide multilingual, nonpartisan civic education and reliable information. When the process is both provably secure and practically accessible, people are more willing to accept outcomes\u2014even when they disagree with them.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on reforms people can see, understand, and verify. That means using auditable systems (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records), routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where appropriate), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and clear, timely public reporting in plain language about how results are counted, checked, and certified. Rules should be applied consistently, with transparent, nonpartisan oversight and meaningful observation by multiple perspectives, while protecting voter privacy and safety and enforcing strong penalties for intimidation and deliberate, provable misinformation. At the same time, trust grows when participation is practical and inclusive: accessible polling places, reasonable hours, accommodations for disabilities, multilingual information, and voter education through schools, libraries, and trusted community organizations so people can recognize misinformation and understand the safeguards. By combining verifiable integrity, consistent rules, and respectful access, institutions can earn confidence\u2014even from people who disagree politically.",

That means using auditable systems (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records), routine independent post-election audits, strong cybersecurity, and clear chain-of-custody rules so results can be checked and proven without compromising privacy. Trust also depends on consistent, nonpartisan administration with bipartisan/public observation, clear standards that are applied the same way across communities, and prompt, plain-language reporting that explains what happened, what was verified, and how problems are corrected.\n\nAt the same time, institutions earn confidence when they serve everyone respectfully: accessible polling places, practical voting options that fit real work and family schedules, accommodations for disabilities, and multilingual information for communities that need it. Finally, sustained civic education and media literacy\u2014delivered through schools, libraries, community groups, and trusted local leaders\u2014should explain how institutions work and how to verify claims, so misinformation has less room to spread. When people can see the rules, understand the process, and independently confirm outcomes, trust can be rebuilt across political and cultural lines.",
