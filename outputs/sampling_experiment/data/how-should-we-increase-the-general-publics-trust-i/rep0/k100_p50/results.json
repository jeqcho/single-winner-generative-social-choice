    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and observe real accountability when mistakes happen. A practical middle-ground approach is to set clear, publicly posted standards; publish understandable data and reasons for major decisions; and invite independent review (audits, inspectors general, bipartisan or cross-community oversight) with findings released in plain language. Institutions should also protect access and equal treatment\u2014through strong ethics rules, conflict-of-interest limits, and reliable service that works for everyone\u2014while taking security and privacy seriously. Finally, rebuilding trust requires two-way communication: regular local forums, multilingual and disability-accessible information, and quick, transparent corrections so communities feel heard and can judge performance based on evidence rather than rumors.",

We should use transparent, auditable processes (including paper ballots or other voter-verifiable records), routine independent post-election audits such as risk-limiting audits, and strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections. Administration should be nonpartisan and accountable, with bipartisan and public observation where appropriate, and clear, timely public reporting in plain language about how results are counted, certified, and corrected if problems occur. At the same time, access must remain practical and inclusive\u2014reliable polling places and hours, secure early and mail voting with clear safeguards, and strong accommodations for disabilities and multiple languages\u2014so every eligible voter can participate confidently. Finally, sustained nonpartisan civics education and community outreach (through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations) should provide factual information and media literacy to reduce misinformation and rebuild confidence over time.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the system easier to verify, easier to understand, and easier to access, while being honest about problems and how they\u2019re fixed. That means clear, consistently applied rules; nonpartisan administration with bipartisan and public observation; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and a voter-verifiable record (such as paper ballots or an auditable paper trail) backed by routine independent audits, with plain-language public reports of what was checked and what was found. Trust also grows when institutions serve everyone fairly, so information should be timely, multilingual, and accessible (including disability accommodations), with practical options like reliable in-person voting, early voting, and well-secured vote-by-mail where used. Finally, institutions and community partners\u2014schools, libraries, local groups, faith communities, and media\u2014should invest in nonpartisan civic education and media literacy, and officials should correct misinformation with evidence and transparency rather than blame. When people can see the safeguards, understand the process, and verify results without partisan spin, confidence rises across communities.",
