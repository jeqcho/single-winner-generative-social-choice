    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and leaders are accountable regardless of party. We should standardize transparent, verifiable procedures: voter-verified paper ballots or auditable records, strong chain-of-custody, routine independent audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible), and clear public reporting of what went right, what went wrong, and how issues were fixed. Access and integrity should advance together by ensuring polling places are safe and welcoming, assistance is available in plain language and multiple formats, and eligible voters can participate without unnecessary barriers. Finally, institutions should earn confidence through consistent enforcement of the law, open data where privacy allows, and regular community-facing explanations from trusted local officials, so trust is built through evidence and responsiveness rather than rhetoric.",

We should run elections with transparent, secure, and accessible procedures: a verifiable paper record (or auditable record), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent post\u2011election audits such as risk\u2011limiting audits, with results and any issues explained publicly in plain language. Bipartisan, nonpartisan oversight and consistent, well\u2011resourced local administration can reduce confusion and partisan suspicion. At the same time, institutions should invest in clear civics and voter education, multilingual and disability\u2011accessible support, and timely, accurate communication that counters misinformation without inflaming it\u2014so every eligible voter can participate confidently and the public can trust outcomes even when their side loses.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules and results easy to verify, easy to explain, and hard to manipulate. That means clear, consistent procedures; strong security with a documented chain of custody; and routine independent audits (like risk-limiting audits) that are publicly reported in plain language. Institutions should be adequately funded and staffed, offer accessible services for seniors, people with disabilities, and those facing language or literacy barriers, and protect everyone\u2019s rights while deterring intimidation and threats. Just as importantly, leaders and officials should communicate calmly, promptly, and honestly\u2014sharing what is known, what is being checked, and how problems are fixed\u2014so misinformation has less room to grow. When everyday people can see how decisions are made, how money is spent, and how outcomes are verified, trust becomes something institutions earn through transparency, fairness, and accountability.",
