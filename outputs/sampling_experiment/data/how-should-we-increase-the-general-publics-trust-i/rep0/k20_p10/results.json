    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and verify that decisions are made fairly and competently\u2014and when institutions are honest about mistakes. A practical middle ground is to pair strong transparency (plain-language explanations, open meetings and data where privacy allows, and clear performance metrics) with independent oversight (regular audits, inspectors general, and bipartisan/nonpartisan review panels) and real accountability (consistent enforcement of rules and meaningful consequences for misconduct). Institutions should also invest in accessibility and responsiveness\u2014timely service, respectful treatment, multilingual communication, and easy ways for the public to ask questions and appeal decisions\u2014while protecting privacy and security. Finally, building trust requires steady community engagement: partnering with local schools, libraries, and civic groups to explain how systems work, address misinformation with evidence, and invite feedback so policies reflect the people they serve.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make decision-making transparent, verifiable, and easy for ordinary people to understand. That means clear, plain-language explanations of rules and outcomes; open, publicly reportable processes; and independent oversight that includes bipartisan and nonpartisan professionals. For elections specifically, use secure systems with auditable paper records (or equivalent), strong chain-of-custody, and routine post-election risk-limiting audits, with audit findings and data shared promptly in accessible formats. Trust also grows when institutions are fair and inclusive: expand reliable voting options and public services without sacrificing security, provide multilingual information, and invest in nonpartisan civic education through schools and trusted community spaces like libraries. Finally, respond quickly and honestly when problems occur\u2014acknowledging mistakes, correcting them in public, and countering misinformation with evidence and transparency rather than rhetoric.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared basics: make decisions and results easy to check, easy to understand, and fair to everyone. That means transparent rules and procedures, clear plain\u2011language explanations (in multiple languages), and public reporting that shows what happened and why. It also means strong safeguards that people across the political spectrum can verify: secure systems, auditable records (such as paper backups where appropriate), routine independent audits, and clear chain\u2011of\u2011custody standards so people know information and materials weren\u2019t tampered with. \n\nTrust also grows when institutions treat people with respect and show their work locally. We should invest in well-trained, nonpartisan staff; consistent standards that still allow local access; and community-based education through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations so residents can learn how processes work and how to spot misinformation. Finally, institutions should admit mistakes quickly, correct them transparently, and create simple ways for the public to ask questions, observe, and provide feedback\u2014because accountability, accessibility, and honest communication are what make trust durable.",
