    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is strengthened when people can see that decisions are made fairly, competently, and with real accountability. Institutions should be transparent about how decisions are reached and how money is spent, publish clear performance measures, and invite independent audits and oversight that are insulated from partisan pressure. They should communicate in plain language, correct mistakes quickly, and make it easy for people to access services and appeal decisions without fear or favoritism. At the same time, communities, schools, and media partners should support civic education and reliable information channels so misinformation is addressed with evidence, not rhetoric. When institutions consistently follow the same rules for everyone, protect rights and privacy, and demonstrate measurable results, trust can be earned across political and cultural lines.",

That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; paper-based or otherwise verifiable records; routine independent checks such as risk-limiting audits; strong cybersecurity and clear chains of custody; and bipartisan/community oversight with results communicated promptly and plainly. Institutions should proactively counter misinformation with accessible facts, publish understandable explanations of procedures and standards, and invest in ongoing civics and public education through schools and community partners. Trust grows when rules are consistent, accountability is visible, and people can see\u2014without being experts\u2014that systems are fair, secure, and applied equally to everyone.",

That means using strong \u201cproof and transparency\u201d practices: paper or otherwise verifiable records, routine independent audits, published procedures and timelines, and clear ways for the public (including bipartisan/community observers) to see how processes work without compromising privacy or safety. Institutions should communicate in plain, respectful language, in the major languages of the community, and provide consistent updates that separate facts from opinion.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions show fairness and accountability in everyday interactions: applying rules consistently, protecting equal access and civil rights, preventing conflicts of interest, and investigating mistakes or misconduct quickly with public reporting on what was found and what changed. Finally, invest in practical civics and media-literacy education\u2014through schools, community centers, and trusted local leaders\u2014so people of all ages can understand how systems work, how claims are checked, and how to participate constructively. When institutions can show their work, admit errors, and correct them, confidence is earned across political lines.",
