    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see that the rules are clear, applied consistently, and enforced fairly. A practical middle ground is to strengthen transparency and accountability while protecting access: use a voter-verifiable paper record for every ballot, maintain strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and conduct routine, independent post-election audits with results published in plain language. Pair these safeguards with reasonable, non-discriminatory identity and eligibility checks, well-resourced local election offices, and clear avenues for bipartisan and community observers to watch the process without intimidation or disruption. Finally, invest in ongoing civics education, multilingual public information, and rapid, evidence-based corrections so misinformation is less persuasive. When verification is real, oversight is balanced, and participation is straightforward, more people will accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on transparency, consistent rules, and clear accountability that people can see and verify. That means using auditable records (such as verifiable paper ballots or secure paper backups), maintaining rigorous chain-of-custody, conducting routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible), and publicly reporting the results in plain language. Oversight should be genuinely bipartisan and open to qualified observers, while protecting voters and poll workers from threats and ensuring polling places are safe, accessible, and run with consistent standards across jurisdictions. At the same time, institutions must communicate early and often\u2014through nonpartisan, multilingual information, prompt corrections, and practical civics and media-literacy education\u2014so communities understand how decisions are made, how funds are used, and how claims of irregularities are investigated. By combining verifiable procedures, equal access for eligible voters, and honest, understandable communication, institutions can earn confidence even from people who disagree with the outcomes.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared commitments: transparency people can see, rules applied consistently, and accountability that\u2019s independent and fair. That means maintaining a verifiable record of decisions (for elections: paper ballots or voter-verifiable backups), routine independent audits with publicly posted results, and strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards. It also means clear, plain-language communication\u2014shared quickly, corrected openly when wrong, and offered in accessible formats and major community languages\u2014so people understand how decisions are made and how problems are handled. Institutions should make participation practical and equal by investing in well-run local offices, safe and accessible locations and hours, and simple ways for residents to ask questions and get answers. Finally, we should strengthen civic education and media literacy in schools and community spaces so people can evaluate claims and misinformation. When institutions prove their work, invite oversight from multiple perspectives, and treat everyone with the same respect, trust can be rebuilt over time.",
