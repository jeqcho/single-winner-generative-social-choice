    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when rules are clear, outcomes are verifiable, and people feel respected regardless of party, background, or zip code. A workable middle ground is to pair strong security with strong transparency: use voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent), maintain strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and conduct routine, publicly reported audits with bipartisan and independent oversight. Just as important, institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual language, publish timely data and explanations about how decisions are made, and create regular opportunities for community observation and feedback so concerns are heard early and answered with evidence. Protecting access for all eligible voters, preventing intimidation, and correcting misinformation quickly and openly can help confidence be earned through consistent, accountable performance\u2014not partisan assurances.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in elections and other public institutions, we should earn confidence through processes that are transparent, nonpartisan, and verifiable. That means clear rules applied consistently; secure chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity; paper ballots or voter-verifiable records; and routine, publicly reported risk-limiting audits with bipartisan and independent oversight so results can be checked, not just asserted. We should protect equal access for every eligible voter with practical options like early voting and secure vote-by-mail where appropriate, while enforcing strong safeguards against intimidation, suppression, and political interference. Finally, institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual language\u2014before, during, and after Election Day\u2014so people understand how ballots are counted and results certified, and misinformation can be addressed with timely, evidence-based explanations.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in our elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014we should focus on reforms people can see, understand, and verify: clear rules applied consistently, strong safeguards that protect both access and security, and regular independent checks that are publicly reported. For elections, that means verifiable paper records (or equivalent auditable records), routine risk-limiting audits, secure chain-of-custody, robust cybersecurity, and bipartisan/independent oversight with meaningful transparency for observers. Just as important, institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, partner with trusted local messengers (schools, libraries, veterans\u2019 groups, faith and community organizations), and respond quickly to misinformation with facts and evidence. Trust is earned when processes are fair, accountable, accessible to every eligible voter, and demonstrated openly\u2014so people don\u2019t have to rely on rumors or partisan claims to know the system is working.",
