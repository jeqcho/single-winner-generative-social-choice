We should set clear, consistent rules; publish plain-language explanations of processes and spending; and create routine independent audits and public reporting that protect privacy while enabling meaningful oversight. Institutions should work with bipartisan or cross-community review boards, local trusted partners, and multilingual outreach so information reaches people where they are, not just where officials post it. At the same time, services must be accessible and fair\u2014so people experience competence, equal treatment, and due process in everyday interactions. When institutions communicate calmly, correct misinformation with evidence, and demonstrate accountability through measurable improvements, confidence can be rebuilt across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in key institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easier for everyday people to verify, not just to accept. That means transparent, consistently applied procedures with auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable records), routine independent post\u2011election audits (including risk\u2011limiting audits where appropriate), and strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity protections that safeguard both integrity and voter privacy. Trust also grows when administration is nonpartisan and accountable through bipartisan or cross\u2011community oversight, well\u2011trained staff, and clear standards across jurisdictions. Finally, institutions should communicate calmly and promptly in plain language and multiple languages, openly report how outcomes were checked, quickly investigate and explain irregularities, and invest in ongoing civics education and community partnerships to counter misinformation and help people understand how the system works.",
