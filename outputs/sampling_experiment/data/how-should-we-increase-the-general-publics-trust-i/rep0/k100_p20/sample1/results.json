    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on procedures that people across viewpoints can verify and understand. That means clear, consistently applied rules; strong privacy and cybersecurity protections; and a reliable audit trail (such as voter-verifiable paper records) with routine, independent post-election audits and publicly available, plain-language reports of findings. At the same time, access should be broad and practical: secure options for voting in person and by mail where used, well-trained and accountable poll workers, and accommodations for disabilities and language needs. Trust also grows when institutions communicate early and often\u2014explaining what went right, what went wrong, and how problems are fixed\u2014while supporting ongoing civics and media literacy so people can evaluate claims and misinformation. The goal is a system where every eligible voter can participate, every valid ballot is counted, and the public can see the evidence that the process is fair.",

That means transparent, consistently applied procedures; auditable paper records and routine independent post-election audits with plain-language public reports; and nonpartisan/bipartisan oversight with robust opportunities for observation while protecting voter privacy. We should also maintain strong security (including cybersecurity), accurate voter rolls, and clear eligibility checks, while ensuring voting is accessible for all eligible citizens, including people with disabilities and communities that need multilingual information. Finally, we should invest in ongoing civics and media literacy education and fast, fact-based communication to counter misinformation so the public understands the safeguards and can judge the process on evidence rather than rumors.",

That means clear, consistent rules; transparent operations; and independent oversight that is visibly nonpartisan. For elections specifically, this includes an auditable paper record, routine post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with public reports in plain language, strong cybersecurity and privacy protections, and open observation opportunities with clear guardrails against harassment or interference. Access also matters for trust: secure options that work for working families, older adults, people with disabilities, and language communities, paired with well-trained frontline staff and reliable customer-service style support. Finally, institutions should earn trust over time by communicating early and honestly about mistakes and fixes, publishing performance metrics, and investing in ongoing civics and media literacy so people can tell the difference between evidence and rumor. The goal is simple: decisions are made by rules everyone can see, outcomes can be checked, and every eligible person can participate without fear or confusion.",
