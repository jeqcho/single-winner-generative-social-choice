    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied consistently, and experience fair treatment in everyday interactions. A practical middle ground is to set clear, nonpartisan standards for transparency (plain-language explanations, open meetings where feasible, and accessible public data), accountability (independent audits and inspectors general with real authority, published performance metrics, and swift correction of errors), and integrity (strong ethics rules, conflict-of-interest disclosure, and protections for whistleblowers). Institutions should pair these safeguards with meaningful community involvement\u2014listening sessions, citizen advisory panels, and partnerships with trusted local organizations\u2014while investing in civic education and rapid, evidence-based responses to misinformation. The goal is not blind trust, but earned confidence: institutions that are effective, open to scrutiny, and respectful of everyone they serve.",

We should use voter-verifiable paper ballots (or auditable paper records), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine post-election risk-limiting audits with findings reported clearly and promptly. Nonpartisan, accountable administration with bipartisan oversight, well-trained election workers, and timely, plain-language public communication\u2014including multilingual materials\u2014can reduce confusion and misinformation, while expanding practical access (early voting and secure absentee options) so every eligible voter can participate confidently without sacrificing privacy or security.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared basics: make decisions transparent, results verifiable, and services accessible to every eligible person. That means using auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), regular independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where appropriate), strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody practices, and clear, timely public reporting of what happened and why.\n\nTrust also depends on how institutions communicate and treat people. Information should be plain-language, nonpartisan, and easy to find\u2014shared through trusted local messengers like schools, libraries, community groups, and faith organizations\u2014and available in the languages people use at home (including Spanish and other common community languages). When errors occur, institutions should acknowledge them quickly, explain corrective steps publicly, and publish audit findings so citizens can verify outcomes without sacrificing privacy.\n\nFinally, institutions should invest in consistent training and support for frontline staff, set evidence-based standards while respecting local needs, and expand convenient options (early voting, secure mail voting, accessible in-person sites) in ways that maintain security and equal treatment. These practical steps\u2014verifiable processes, independent oversight, plain communication, and fair access\u2014create confidence across different communities and political viewpoints.",
