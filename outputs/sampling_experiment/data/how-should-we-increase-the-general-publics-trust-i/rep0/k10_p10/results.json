    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, competently, and with accountability. We should pair strong, common-sense safeguards (paper records or equivalent verifiable trails, secure chain-of-custody, routine independent audits, and clear conflict-of-interest rules) with broad, practical access (multilingual information, disability accommodations, and flexible voting options) so security and participation reinforce each other. Institutions should communicate in plain language, publish timely evidence for key claims, invite cross-partisan and community-based observation, and correct mistakes openly. Finally, long-term trust depends on consistent standards, professional training for frontline workers, and ongoing civic education that helps people evaluate information and resist misinformation without silencing legitimate questions.",

Results should be reported with plain\u2011language explanations and publicly accessible data that show how votes were counted and certified, while protecting privacy. Trust also depends on inclusive access\u2014flexible voting options (early, mail with clear safeguards, and accessible polling places), well\u2011trained election workers, and multilingual voter information delivered through trusted local community partners.

That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; secure, auditable systems (including paper records where appropriate), routine independent post-audits, and strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity. It also means barrier-free access for eligible participants\u2014clear registration and voting options that work for seniors, working families, students, people with disabilities, and multilingual communities\u2014so integrity and participation rise together.
