    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when rules are clear, applied consistently, and backed by proof that everyday people can check. We should use voting systems with a voter-verifiable record (such as paper ballots or an auditable paper trail), enforce strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and require routine independent post-election audits with results published in plain language. Access and security should be strengthened together: reliable polling places, options like early and mail voting with clear safeguards, accommodations for disabilities, and multilingual information so all eligible voters can participate confidently. Finally, institutions should earn credibility through calm, timely communication that explains what happened, what went wrong (if anything), and how it was fixed\u2014paired with sustained civics and media-literacy education and transparent channels for public questions and oversight.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in elections, we should focus on procedures that people across viewpoints can see, understand, and verify. That means nonpartisan administration with bipartisan observation; a voter-verified paper ballot (or an auditable paper record) with strict chain-of-custody; routine, independent post-election audits\u2014such as risk-limiting audits\u2014with findings published quickly in plain language; and strong cybersecurity and physical security to protect voters and election workers. At the same time, we should keep voting accessible for all eligible citizens through well-run polling places, reasonable hours and options like early voting, and clear, multilingual voter information and civics education that explains how ballots are cast, counted, audited, and certified. When rules are applied consistently, mistakes are acknowledged and corrected transparently, and the public can verify results without partisan spin, confidence in institutions can be earned and sustained.",

That means clear, consistently applied rules; nonpartisan professional administration with bipartisan/community oversight; and transparent safeguards such as voter-verifiable records (like paper trails), strong chain-of-custody, and routine independent audits with results published in plain language. Institutions should communicate early and often\u2014promptly reporting what happened, what problems occurred, how they were fixed, and what will change next time\u2014without spin, while protecting privacy and security (including cybersecurity). Trust also grows when access is fair and practical: reliable polling sites, reasonable hours, disability accommodations, and multilingual information so working families, seniors, and immigrant communities can participate confidently. Finally, sustained civics and media-literacy education through schools, libraries, and trusted community organizations can reduce misinformation and help people judge evidence for themselves\u2014so confidence is earned through transparency, accountability, and equal respect for every eligible person.",
