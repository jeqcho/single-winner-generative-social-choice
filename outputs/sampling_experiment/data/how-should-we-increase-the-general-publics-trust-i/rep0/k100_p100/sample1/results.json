    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability, regardless of party. We should use voting systems with a voter-verifiable record (such as paper ballots or an auditable paper backup), protect ballots with documented chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity, and conduct routine, independent post-election audits with results published in plain language. Communities should have meaningful, bipartisan observer access and transparent procedures for investigating and correcting problems, while safeguarding voter privacy and safety at polling places. At the same time, we should reduce barriers for eligible voters through practical access options (reliable polling locations and hours, accessible voting for people with disabilities, and multilingual information), and invest in ongoing civics and media-literacy education so misinformation has less room to spread. When institutions reliably explain what they do, prove it with evidence, and treat people with dignity, trust can be earned and sustained.",

Rules should be clear and applied consistently, with bipartisan observation and open, documented processes for investigating and correcting irregularities. Trust also requires fair access for every eligible voter through well-run polling places, accessible options (including early and secure mail voting where offered), and strong protections against intimidation. Finally, sustained civics and media\u2011literacy education\u2014delivered through schools, libraries, and trusted community groups, including multilingual materials\u2014can counter misinformation and help people understand how votes are counted, audited, and certified.",

Finally, institutions should communicate calmly and promptly, openly acknowledge and fix mistakes, investigate credible concerns without partisan spin, and partner with trusted local messengers (schools, libraries, community and faith organizations) to provide nonpartisan civics and media\u2011literacy education.
