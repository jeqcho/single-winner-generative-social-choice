    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see that rules are fair, applied consistently, and enforced without partisan influence. A strong middle ground is to pair accessible participation with verifiable safeguards: voter-verified records (paper or equivalent), transparent chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, routine independent audits with public summaries, and meaningful opportunities for bipartisan and community observation. Institutions should communicate early and often in plain, multilingual language, publish clear data about performance and mistakes, and explain what was fixed and why. Finally, investing in practical civics education and supporting trusted local messengers (schools, libraries, faith and community groups) can help people distinguish facts from rumors and feel respected, included, and confident that every eligible vote is counted accurately.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on what people can see, verify, and understand. That means transparent, consistently applied rules; nonpartisan administration with bipartisan and community oversight; and verifiable systems such as voter\u2011verified paper ballots (or equally auditable records), strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody, robust cybersecurity, and routine independent post\u2011election audits with clear public reports. Trust also grows when voting is accessible and safe for every eligible voter through reliable polling locations, reasonable hours, and secure options like early and mail voting, alongside protections against intimidation. Finally, institutions must communicate in plain, multilingual language, promptly acknowledge and correct errors, and invest in practical civic education through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations so misinformation has less room to spread and people feel respected, informed, and confident in the results.",

We should strengthen transparency and accountability by using verifiable records (such as paper ballots or auditable backups), routine independent audits, strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and open observation with clear public reporting of what happened, what went right, and how problems were fixed. Trust also depends on access and respect: make voting and other public services predictable and workable for busy working people and seniors, expand language access (including Spanish) and plain-language explanations, and partner with trusted local messengers like libraries, schools, and community organizations to teach how processes work and to counter misinformation with timely, factual updates. Finally, protect safety and dignity\u2014prevent intimidation, enforce rules evenly, and ensure officials are nonpartisan and responsive\u2014so every eligible person can participate and feel confident that outcomes reflect the evidence, not politics.",
