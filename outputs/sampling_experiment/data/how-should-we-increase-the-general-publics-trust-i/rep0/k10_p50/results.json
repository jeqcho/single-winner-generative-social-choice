Institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual language, publish timely data and explanations when problems occur, invite bipartisan and community observation, and hold officials accountable for misconduct\u2014while investing in ongoing civics and media\u2011literacy education so misinformation has less room to spread. If institutions are transparent about what they do, honest about what goes wrong, and consistent in applying the rules, trust can be earned across political and cultural lines.",

Election officials and the media should communicate promptly and calmly in plain, multilingual language\u2014explaining how votes are collected, counted, audited, and certified; acknowledging errors honestly; and showing what was fixed. Finally, sustained civics education and partnerships with trusted local institutions (schools, libraries, community and faith organizations) can help people distinguish verified information from rumors, so confidence is built on evidence rather than partisan messaging.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should make key decisions and services more transparent, independently verifiable, and consistently applied\u2014while keeping them accessible and respectful to the communities they serve. That means clear, plain\u2011language explanations of rules and decisions; regular independent audits and public reporting; strong ethics and anti\u2011corruption safeguards; and timely, honest communication when mistakes happen, including what was fixed and how it will be prevented. Trust also grows when people can see and participate in oversight locally\u2014through public meetings, open records, and community partners like libraries, schools, and civic groups\u2014and when information is available in the languages people use at home. Finally, institutions should balance security and privacy with fair access, invest in frontline staff and modern infrastructure, and hold leaders accountable for spreading provably false claims that undermine confidence. When institutions are easy to understand, hard to manipulate, and willing to show their work, people across backgrounds are more likely to trust them.",
