We should run elections with nonpartisan local professionals and bipartisan public oversight, use voter-verified paper records (or equivalent verifiable trails), and conduct routine risk-limiting audits with results published quickly in plain language. Security should be strengthened through strong cybersecurity, secure voter registration, and transparent procedures for addressing errors, intimidation, and attempted interference. At the same time, voting must be accessible: clear registration options, safe and convenient early and mail voting, accessible polling places, and multilingual information so every eligible voter can participate confidently. Finally, sustained civics education and trusted community partnerships\u2014schools, libraries, faith and neighborhood groups\u2014should provide factual, nonpartisan explanations and rapid corrections to misinformation, so confidence is earned through openness, evidence, and respect for every community.",
