    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the rules are clear, the process is provably accurate, and every eligible voter can participate without fear or confusion. A strong middle-ground approach is to use voter-verifiable records (paper ballots or secure paper backups), protect a strict chain of custody, and require routine, independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with findings published in plain language and open to bipartisan observation. At the same time, election offices should offer practical, secure access options\u2014well-run in-person voting, early voting where feasible, and mail voting with transparent safeguards\u2014plus reasonable identity and eligibility checks that prevent fraud without creating undue barriers. Finally, officials, media, schools, and trusted community groups should provide timely, multilingual, nonpartisan explanations of how votes are cast, counted, and certified, and address mistakes openly and quickly, so confidence is earned through evidence and accountability rather than partisan claims.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules and results easy to verify, easy to understand, and consistently applied. That means nonpartisan, professionally run administration with bipartisan/independent oversight; voter\u2011verifiable records (such as paper ballots or secure paper backups); strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity; and routine post\u2011election audits (including risk\u2011limiting audits) with plain\u2011language public reports and open observation where legally appropriate. Trust also depends on fair access: well\u2011staffed polling places, reasonable hours, secure options like early and mail voting with clear safeguards, and accommodations for disabilities and language needs so every eligible voter can participate without confusion. Finally, institutions should communicate promptly and calmly, publish timely corrections when problems occur, and invest in civic education and media literacy through schools, libraries, and trusted community organizations to counter misinformation with verifiable facts. When people can see how decisions are made, how integrity is checked, and how concerns are addressed, confidence is earned and sustained.",
