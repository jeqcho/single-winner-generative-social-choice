    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see consistent rules, real accountability, and practical service to the public. We should set clear, baseline standards that every community can understand: a verifiable record of each ballot, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine post-election audits that are open to qualified observers and reported in plain language. Voting should remain secure and accessible at the same time, with reliable in-person options and carefully safeguarded alternatives like early voting and mail ballots where used, plus reasonable identity and eligibility checks that protect privacy and avoid unnecessary barriers. When problems occur, officials should investigate quickly, publish what happened and what changed, and invite independent review. Finally, sustained civics and media-literacy education\u2014delivered through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations in multiple languages\u2014can reduce misinformation and help people judge institutions by transparent evidence rather than partisan claims.",

That means using reliable, auditable records (such as voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent), maintaining a clear chain of custody, and conducting routine independent post\u2011election audits (including risk\u2011limiting audits where feasible) with bipartisan and community observation. Trust also grows when rules are applied consistently, voting options are accessible and safe for all eligible voters (including seniors, people with disabilities, and multilingual communities), and officials communicate promptly in plain language about procedures, results, and any errors and fixes. Finally, sustained nonpartisan civics and media\u2011literacy education\u2014delivered through schools, libraries, and trusted local organizations\u2014can help people distinguish facts from misinformation and understand how accountability is enforced. When institutions show their work, invite oversight, and communicate clearly and respectfully, confidence is earned and can endure even in disagreement.",
