    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in elections, we should focus on measures that are both secure and easy for everyday voters to verify. That means transparent, uniform minimum standards for ballot handling and tabulation; auditable paper records (or voter-verifiable paper backups) for all votes; routine, independent post-election audits with publicly posted methods and results; and strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody practices. At the same time, we should protect broad access\u2014early voting, secure vote-by-mail with tracking where used, accessible polling places, and clear multilingual guidance\u2014so eligible voters can participate without unnecessary barriers. Finally, trusted local election officials and community partners should communicate quickly and plainly, correct misinformation with evidence, and open the process to bipartisan and nonpartisan observers under consistent rules, so people across the political spectrum can see that the rules are fair, the outcomes are checkable, and every eligible vote is counted.",

Administration should be transparently nonpartisan, with bipartisan oversight and clearly defined roles for local election officials, so the public can see consistent rules being followed and problems addressed openly.\n\nTrust also grows when access is fair and practical for every eligible voter: clear voter information, multilingual materials, accessible polling places, and secure options like early voting and mail voting with tracking where available. Finally, institutions should respond to misinformation with timely, factual communication and ongoing civics education through trusted community partners\u2014schools, local organizations, and civic leaders\u2014so people understand how eligibility is verified, how ballots are handled, and why the final count is reliable.",
