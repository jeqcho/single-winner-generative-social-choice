    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections rises when people can see\u2014without needing to take anyone\u2019s word for it\u2014that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and the results are independently checkable. A strong middle ground is to use voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots), maintain clear chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and require routine post-election audits with publicly posted methods and results. Administration should be professional and nonpartisan, with balanced observer access and real accountability when errors occur. At the same time, trust depends on equal access: convenient options for in-person and mail voting, accessible polling places, and clear, plain-language information in multiple languages. Finally, institutions should consistently and quickly correct misinformation with transparent data and local, community-trusted outreach so voters across parties feel confident their ballot was counted as cast.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in elections\u2014and in democratic institutions more broadly\u2014we should focus on a system people can see, understand, and verify. That means using auditable paper ballots (or voter-verified paper records), protecting chain of custody, and conducting independent post-election risk-limiting audits with results published promptly. Administration should be professional and nonpartisan, with transparent bipartisan oversight and clear accountability when mistakes occur. Just as important, access must be fair and practical: well-funded local election offices, clear ballots and procedures, accessible polling places, and secure early and mail voting options with tracking where available. Finally, we should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, and invest in trustworthy civics and voter education through community institutions (like libraries and schools) to counter misinformation and help every voter understand how their vote is counted.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on results people can see: rules that are clear, applied consistently, and checked independently. That means using auditable paper ballots (or an equivalent voter-verifiable record), protecting chain of custody, strengthening cybersecurity, and conducting routine, publicly reported post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) so outcomes can be verified without partisan spin. Oversight should be genuinely bipartisan and community-based, with strong professional standards and accountability for mistakes or misconduct.\n\nTrust also depends on fair access and respectful communication. We should fund local offices so polling places are well-run, lines are shorter, and voting options (in-person, early, and secure mail with tracking where offered) work for working families, seniors, rural voters, and people with disabilities. Information should be plain-language and available in the major languages used locally\u2014including Spanish and Native languages where needed\u2014so everyone understands how to register, vote, and confirm their ballot was counted. Finally, institutions should respond quickly to misinformation with transparent facts, open data where appropriate, and trusted messengers from across the community, because confidence grows when the process is both secure and understandable for all.",
