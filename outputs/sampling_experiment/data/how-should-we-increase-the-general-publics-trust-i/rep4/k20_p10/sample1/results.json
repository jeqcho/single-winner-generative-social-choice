    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and the results are independently verified. A durable approach is to use reliable records of every vote (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable backups), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine, publicly reported audits conducted by independent professionals with transparent methods and opportunities for bipartisan or cross-community observation. Access should be broad and practical\u2014safe polling places, reasonable wait times, options for voters with disabilities, and clear multilingual guidance\u2014while keeping eligibility rules consistent and predictable so voters and administrators know what to expect. Institutions should communicate early and plainly about how the system works, correct mistakes quickly, protect election workers from harassment, and work with media and platforms to reduce demonstrably false claims without restricting legitimate debate. When security, transparency, and inclusion are treated as shared civic goals rather than partisan tools, more people can accept outcomes even when their side loses.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in our elections and democratic institutions, we should make the process easy to see, easy to verify, and fair for everyone\u2014regardless of party, language, or background. That means using verifiable paper ballots (or equally durable auditable records), strong chain-of-custody rules, and routine independent post-election audits\u2014such as risk-limiting audits\u2014that are transparent and open to bipartisan and public observation. We should also invest in secure election infrastructure and cybersecurity, protect and train election workers, and keep rules clear and consistent so people know what to expect. Finally, trust grows when officials communicate results and safeguards in plain language, provide multilingual voter education, expand accessible voting options (including for people with disabilities and those with busy schedules), and work with media and platforms to quickly correct misinformation with timely, factual information.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared basics: transparency people can see, security people can verify, and service that treats everyone with respect. That means using systems with durable records (like paper ballots or auditable backups), clear chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine independent audits whose methods and results are published in plain language. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and accountable, with clear rules that are applied consistently and changed only with ample notice.\n\nTrust also depends on how institutions communicate and serve. Officials should provide timely, factual information, correct errors openly, and work with media and platforms to reduce deliberate disinformation while protecting free speech. Voting (and other public services) should be accessible\u2014shorter lines, convenient options, disability access, and multilingual materials\u2014so working families, seniors, and non-English speakers can participate confidently. Finally, we should protect frontline workers from harassment and ensure leaders model integrity, because people trust institutions most when they can verify the process and feel treated fairly.",
