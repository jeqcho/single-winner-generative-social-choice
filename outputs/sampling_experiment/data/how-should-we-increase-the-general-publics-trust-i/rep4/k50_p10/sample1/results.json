A practical middle ground is to strengthen transparency and verification\u2014paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records, routine risk-limiting audits, and public reporting of results and audit findings in plain language\u2014while also investing in well-trained, adequately funded local election offices and strong cybersecurity. Eligibility checks should be accurate and consistently applied, with secure options to verify identity (including accessible alternatives for voters who lack certain documents), regular voter-roll maintenance with safeguards against wrongful removals, and clear avenues to resolve issues quickly. Finally, multilingual voter education and partnerships with trusted community organizations can counter misinformation and help voters understand how votes are cast, counted, and independently checked.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in our elections, we should focus on practical, visible safeguards that protect both integrity and access. That means using paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records, routine independent risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language, strong cybersecurity, and clear chain-of-custody procedures that the public can observe. Election rules should be consistent and well-explained across jurisdictions, with adequately funded local election offices and transparent, nonpartisan administration accountable to the community. Where identification is used, it should be implemented in ways that confirm eligibility without creating unnecessary barriers, paired with accessible polling places and clear, multilingual voter education. By combining verifiable security with respectful communication and broad participation, we can give people confidence that every eligible vote is counted accurately and fairly.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on visible fairness, consistent rules, and everyday accountability. That means clear and uniform procedures that are easy to understand; secure systems with auditable paper records (or equivalent verifiable trails) and routine independent, risk-limiting audits; strong cybersecurity; and transparent public reporting so people can see how results are checked. Access matters too: well-funded local offices, convenient and respectful polling options, and voter materials in plain language and multiple languages so working families, seniors, and immigrant communities can participate confidently. We can also support reasonable identity and eligibility verification that protects against fraud without creating unnecessary barriers, paired with regular roll maintenance that is accurate and publicly explained. Finally, institutions should partner with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, faith and community groups\u2014to provide nonpartisan civic education and rapid, fact-based responses to misinformation. When people can observe the safeguards, understand the rules, and feel respected, trust has a practical foundation.",
