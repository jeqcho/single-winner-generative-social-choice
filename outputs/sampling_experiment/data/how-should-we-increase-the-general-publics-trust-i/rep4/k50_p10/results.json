    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability. We should set transparent standards for election administration: a voter-verified record (paper ballots where feasible or equally auditable systems), routine independent audits with publicly posted results, strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody practices, and straightforward procedures for correcting errors. At the same time, access must be practical for all eligible voters through well-staffed polling places, reasonable early and mail options with tracking, and information in plain language and multiple formats. Bipartisan and nonpartisan oversight, stable funding for local administrators, and trusted community partners (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups) can help share accurate information and reduce misinformation without partisan messaging.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in elections\u2014and in the institutions that administer them\u2014we should focus on processes that are secure, transparent, and easy for everyday people to verify and understand. That means using verifiable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records) with routine, independent post-election risk-limiting audits; strong cybersecurity and clear chain-of-custody; and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with real accountability when errors occur. At the same time, participation should be practical and fair for all eligible voters: well-funded local election offices, accessible polling places, reasonable wait times, and lawful options like early voting and secure, trackable mail voting where available. Finally, election officials and trusted community partners (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups) should provide clear, plain-language, multilingual voter information and timely explanations of results, while countering misinformation with evidence and transparency rather than partisan spin.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make government actions easy to verify, easy to understand, and fair in practice. That means using auditable systems with a paper record, routine independent audits, strong cybersecurity, and clear chain-of-custody rules, with bipartisan and community oversight so no party or insider controls the process alone. It also means steady funding for local offices and frontline staff so services work reliably, mistakes are corrected quickly, and officials are accountable.\n\nTrust also grows when people feel respected and included. Institutions should provide plain-language explanations of decisions and results, publish timely data and audit findings, and communicate in the languages people speak at home (including Spanish). Access should be practical for seniors, working families, people with disabilities, and rural communities\u2014through accessible polling places, reasonable options like early voting and secure mail voting with tracking, and clear, consistent rules.\n\nFinally, we should partner with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, faith communities, and civic groups\u2014to strengthen civics education, recruit and train nonpartisan workers, and counter misinformation with transparent evidence rather than partisan spin. When institutions are transparent, competent, and responsive, trust can be earned across generations and communities.",
