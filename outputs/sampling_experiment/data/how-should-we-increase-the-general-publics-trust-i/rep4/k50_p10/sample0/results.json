    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can see, verify, and understand how results are produced\u2014without making it harder for eligible citizens to vote. We should use voting systems with a durable record (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records), conduct routine, publicly reported post-election audits, and maintain strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards. Election offices need stable funding, clear rules applied consistently, and transparent accountability when errors occur, including timely corrections and explanations in plain language. Oversight should include representatives from multiple parties and nonpartisan community observers, with publicly available data and procedures that protect voter privacy. At the same time, we should keep participation practical through accessible polling places, reasonable wait times, and secure options like early voting and well-tracked absentee/mail voting where allowed, paired with broad voter education through trusted local institutions (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups) and rapid, fact-based responses to misinformation.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in elections\u2014and in the institutions that administer them\u2014we should focus on results people can verify and rules everyone can understand. That means secure, transparent voting systems with auditable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), routine independent post-election risk-limiting audits, strong cybersecurity, and clear chain-of-custody procedures. Trust also grows when oversight is genuinely nonpartisan and accountable: bipartisan or multi-partisan monitoring, public reporting of audit findings in plain language, and prompt, transparent correction when errors occur.\n\nAt the same time, legitimacy requires equal access for eligible voters. We should keep polling places and hours sufficient to reduce long lines, ensure accessibility for seniors and people with disabilities, provide clear information in multiple languages, and offer practical options like early voting and secure, trackable mail voting where allowed. Finally, trusted local partners\u2014schools, libraries, community groups, and faith organizations\u2014can help deliver nonpartisan voter education and counter misinformation with consistent, fact-based explanations of how votes are cast, counted, and audited.",

That means transparent, verifiable systems (like auditable paper ballots or voter-verifiable records, routine independent audits, strong cybersecurity, and secure chain-of-custody) combined with stable funding for local offices so the process runs smoothly and errors are fixed quickly and publicly. Trust also grows when access is fair and practical for every eligible voter: reasonable ID options with help obtaining them, safe early and mail voting where allowed with tracking, accessible polling locations, shorter lines, and information in plain language and multiple languages (including Spanish). Finally, we should partner with trusted community anchors\u2014schools, libraries, faith groups, neighborhood organizations, and local leaders\u2014to provide nonpartisan civics education, recruit and train poll workers, and counter misinformation with timely, evidence-based explanations. The goal is a system people can see, understand, and verify\u2014so no matter our politics, we can accept results and keep improving together.",
