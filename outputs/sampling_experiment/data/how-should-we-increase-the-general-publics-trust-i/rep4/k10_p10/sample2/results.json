    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, competently, and with real accountability. We should increase transparency (publish clear explanations of processes, data, and budgets in plain language), strengthen independent oversight (regular audits, ethics enforcement, and conflict-of-interest rules), and make participation accessible (multilingual communication, responsive public hearings, and easy-to-use services). Institutions should admit mistakes quickly, explain what will change, and measure progress with public metrics. By combining strong safeguards against corruption with respectful, consistent communication and community partnership, we can rebuild confidence across political and cultural lines.",

That means using auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter\u2011verifiable paper trails), strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody procedures, and routine independent post\u2011election audits with publicly posted methods and findings. Institutions should be professionally funded and administered with clear accountability, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight, and robust cybersecurity, while communicating promptly and plainly (including multilingual outreach) about how decisions are made, how problems are corrected, and what safeguards are in place. Finally, sustained civics education and community engagement\u2014through schools, local leaders, and open public briefings\u2014can reduce misinformation and help people see, step by step, that the process is fair, secure, and worthy of trust.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared principles: clarity, fairness, and accountability that people can see for themselves. That means transparent rules that are applied consistently, secure and auditable systems (including paper or voter-verifiable records), strong chain-of-custody procedures, and regular independent audits whose results are published in plain language. Institutions should communicate early and often with timely updates, clearly explain what safeguards exist and what happens when errors occur, and provide accessible information in multiple languages and formats. Trust also grows when oversight is genuinely nonpartisan, local communities can observe and participate appropriately, and frontline staff are well-trained and adequately funded so the process works reliably for everyone. Finally, sustained civic education and public forums\u2014grounded in verified facts rather than hype\u2014can help people of all ages understand how decisions are made, how to raise concerns, and how institutions can be held responsible when they fall short.",
