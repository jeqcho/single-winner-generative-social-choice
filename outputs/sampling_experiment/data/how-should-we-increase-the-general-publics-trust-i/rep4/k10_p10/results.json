    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections increases when people can easily see that the rules are fair, the safeguards are real, and every eligible voter can participate without unnecessary hurdles. A strong middle-ground approach is to standardize clear chain-of-custody and transparency practices nationwide while keeping local administration accountable: use paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records wherever possible, conduct routine independent risk-limiting audits, and publish plain-language explanations of what happened at each step\u2014registration, voting, counting, and certification. Pair security with access by expanding convenient options like early voting and secure mail/absentee voting, ensuring disability access, and offering nonpartisan, multilingual voter education. Where voter ID is used, provide free, easy-to-obtain IDs and practical alternatives so no eligible voter is turned away. Finally, support election officials with stable funding, bipartisan observation rules, and rapid, fact-based responses to misinformation so the public can verify outcomes without relying on partisan narratives.",
