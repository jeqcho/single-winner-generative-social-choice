    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and verify that the rules are fair and applied consistently. We should use voting systems with a voter-verifiable record, routine independent audits, and strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, paired with bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight and clear procedures for investigating and correcting problems. At the same time, participation should be straightforward and accessible: well-run polling places, options that accommodate work schedules and disabilities, and accurate information provided in plain language and multiple languages. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often about what is known, what is still being checked, and how results are certified, while actively countering misinformation with timely facts and transparent evidence. When integrity, access, and accountability are built into the process\u2014and explained clearly\u2014confidence can be earned across political and community lines.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in U.S. elections, we should focus on processes that are transparent, nonpartisan, and verifiable in ways ordinary voters can see and understand. This means using paper ballots or voter-verified paper records, maintaining strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and conducting routine risk-limiting post\u2011election audits with bipartisan/independent oversight and clear procedures for resolving challenges. Trust also depends on clear, consistent rules and plain-language, multilingual public communication about how votes are cast, counted, and certified\u2014paired with proactive, factual voter education to counter misinformation. By fully funding local election offices, protecting broad and dignified access (including for people with disabilities), and holding officials accountable to integrity over party, we can earn durable confidence that outcomes reflect the will of the people.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few common-sense commitments: openness people can see, rules that are applied consistently, and accountability when mistakes happen. That means using voting systems with a voter-verifiable paper record (or equally auditable record), secure chain-of-custody, and routine independent audits with results published in plain language so ordinary residents can understand how outcomes were checked. Administration should be nonpartisan, well-funded, and locally supported, with bipartisan oversight and clear timelines for counting and certification, so accuracy is prioritized without unnecessary delays. At the same time, trust depends on fair access: straightforward registration, convenient and disability-accessible voting options, and multilingual information and assistance so every eligible voter\u2014English speakers and non-English speakers alike\u2014can participate with dignity. Finally, institutions should proactively counter misinformation by quickly sharing verified facts, making data and procedures easy to find, and providing a clear process for reporting concerns and getting transparent answers. If people can observe how decisions are made, verify results, and see the same standards applied to everyone, trust is earned over time.",
