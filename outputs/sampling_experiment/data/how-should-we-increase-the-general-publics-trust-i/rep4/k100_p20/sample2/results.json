A workable middle ground is to combine strong security with broad access: use auditable paper records (or voter-verifiable paper trails), publish clear chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and conduct routine, public post-election audits with bipartisan and independent oversight. At the same time, make voting practical for working families, seniors, rural voters, people with disabilities, and language-minority communities through reliable early voting, well-run in-person sites, and secure mail options with tracking and plain-language, multilingual instructions. Institutions should communicate consistently and nonpartisanly\u2014sharing timely results, what was checked, what problems occurred, and how they were fixed\u2014while partnering with trusted local groups (schools, veterans, faith and civic organizations) to expand civics education and counter misinformation without silencing lawful debate.",

We should use secure voting systems with voter-verifiable paper records, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results published quickly in plain language. Election administration should be nonpartisan and transparent, with bipartisan and community oversight that allows credentialed observers to see that procedures are followed while protecting ballot privacy. To strengthen confidence across communities, we should expand practical access options\u2014early voting, well-run Election Day polling, and secure mail voting where offered\u2014paired with clear, multilingual voter information, disability-accessible polling places, and well-trained poll workers. Finally, sustained civics education and proactive, nonpartisan communication that counters misinformation with facts and local trusted messengers can help people understand how elections work and see that every vote is counted fairly.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy to verify, easy to understand, and fair in practice for every community. That means setting clear, consistent rules; using secure systems with paper records or auditable trails; protecting chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and conducting routine, independent audits that are open to bipartisan and community observation. Trust also grows when information is timely, plain-language, and multilingual, and when services are accessible for seniors, people with disabilities, busy working families, and first-time participants. Institutions should invest in nonpartisan, well-trained local staff, stable funding, and regular public reporting that explains what happened, what was checked, and how problems are fixed. Finally, we should strengthen civics education and community partnerships\u2014schools, faith groups, libraries, and local organizations\u2014to counter misinformation with facts and respectful dialogue, so people can see and confidently explain why outcomes are legitimate.",
