We should set and keep straightforward standards for how ballots are cast, secured, counted, and audited; require a durable record (paper or equivalent) with routine, independent post-election audits that are publicly reported; and protect strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity without making voting harder for eligible citizens. Just as important, institutions should communicate early and often in plain language, in multiple languages, and through trusted local messengers, while correcting mistakes quickly and transparently.

That means using secure, auditable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent durable backups), routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where appropriate), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and transparent reporting that the public and bipartisan observers can review. Trust also grows when institutions communicate in plain language, provide consistent rules and stable funding for competent administrators, and offer nonpartisan, multilingual civic education so every community knows how the system works and how problems are corrected. Finally, institutions should address misinformation with timely, evidence-based explanations and open data, so confidence is earned through demonstrated integrity, access, and accountability\u2014not political rhetoric.",
