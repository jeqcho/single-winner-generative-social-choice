    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see\u2014without needing to be an expert\u2014that decisions are made fairly, rules are applied consistently, and mistakes are acknowledged and corrected. We should set clear, publicly available standards for integrity and service, use independent oversight and regular audits, and publish easy-to-understand reports that show what worked, what didn\u2019t, and how problems were fixed. Institutions also need to be accessible: communicate in plain language and multiple languages, provide disability-friendly and convenient ways to engage, and create local, nonpartisan channels for questions and complaints with timely responses. Finally, partnering with trusted community leaders (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups, labor and business groups) can help share accurate information, counter misinformation respectfully, and ensure people from different backgrounds feel heard, included, and confident the system is accountable to everyone.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on processes that are easy to verify, fairly administered, and clearly explained. That means using auditable systems (such as paper records or equivalent verifiable trails), routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and transparent, timely reporting that the public can check. Oversight should be visibly nonpartisan and community-accountable, with bipartisan participation where appropriate, and clear procedures for correcting errors. At the same time, trust requires equal access: accessible polling places and materials, accommodations for people with disabilities, and secure options like early voting and mail voting with clear instructions and tracking. Finally, institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages through trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, faith and civic groups\u2014so people can understand how decisions are made, how safeguards work, and how to raise concerns respectfully and effectively.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the work visible, and the outcomes verifiable, while treating every community with respect. That means stable funding for competent local administration; transparent standards that are applied consistently; strong cybersecurity and secure chain-of-custody; and routine, publicly reported independent audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible) so results can be checked with evidence rather than rumor. At the same time, access must be practical for real lives: safe and accessible polling places, accommodations for people with disabilities, options like early voting and secure mail voting with tracking, and reasonable identity/eligibility checks that protect integrity without creating unnecessary barriers. Trust also grows when communication is plain-language, timely, and multilingual (including Spanish and other commonly used languages), and when trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, faith groups, veterans, worker and neighborhood organizations\u2014help explain how decisions are made and how concerns can be raised and resolved. When institutions show their work, correct errors openly, and invite bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight, people across backgrounds can disagree on politics but still share confidence that the system is fair and accountable.",
