    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections increases when people can both participate easily and verify that results are accurate. A practical middle ground is to set clear, uniform statewide standards that protect access while strengthening security: voter-verified paper records for every ballot (including mail and accessible voting), transparent chain-of-custody procedures, regular risk-limiting post\u2011election audits with public reporting, and independent oversight with bipartisan and nonpartisan observers. States should also offer secure ways to confirm registration and track ballots, keep voter rolls accurate with due-process protections, and provide free, accessible ID options where identification is required so eligible voters are not excluded. Finally, election officials should communicate quickly and plainly\u2014using multilingual, community-based outreach and strong cybersecurity\u2014so misinformation is addressed with facts and every community can see how the system works and why the outcome is trustworthy.",

    "new_statement": "We can increase public trust in US elections by treating election administration like critical public infrastructure: transparent, verifiable, secure, and accessible. That means using voter-verified paper ballots or paper-backed systems; enforcing strict chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity; and conducting routine, independent post-election risk-limiting audits with publicly posted, plain-language explanations of what was checked and what was found. Elections should be run by accountable, nonpartisan local officials with bipartisan oversight and clear, consistent rules applied across jurisdictions.\n\nTrust also depends on a process that people can realistically participate in. We should ensure accessible polling places, reasonable wait times, and reliable early and mail voting with clear instructions and ballot tracking, plus accommodations for people with disabilities. Communities should receive nonpartisan voter education in plain language and multiple languages through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups), while officials provide timely, factual updates to counter misinformation and protect election workers. By combining rigorous verification with respectful access and clear communication, more Americans can see\u2014and confirm\u2014that every eligible vote is counted accurately.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few standards most people can agree on: transparency, accountability, fairness, and respectful access for every eligible person. That means using voting systems that produce a voter-verifiable record (such as paper ballots or paper backups), protecting the chain of custody, and conducting routine, independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible) with results shared in plain language.\n\nTrust also depends on consistent rules and competent, nonpartisan administration. We should adequately fund local offices, strengthen cybersecurity, protect election workers from threats, and ensure bipartisan or multipartisan observation so communities can see the process is being followed. At the same time, participation should be practical for working people, seniors, and people with disabilities\u2014through reliable polling locations, reasonable early voting options, and secure, trackable mail voting where offered.\n\nFinally, institutions earn confidence by communicating early, clearly, and honestly: straightforward explanations of how ballots are verified and counted, timely correction of misinformation, and community-based outreach (including accessible formats and multilingual materials where needed). When people can verify the process, understand the rules, and experience fair treatment, trust has a real foundation.",
