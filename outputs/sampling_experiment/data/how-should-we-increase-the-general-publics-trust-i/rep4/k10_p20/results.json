    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can verify the results for themselves, feel the rules are fair, and experience voting as straightforward and respectful. A practical middle ground is to pair strong security with broad access: use auditable paper records (or voter-verified paper trails), publish routine risk-limiting audits and clear chain-of-custody procedures, and provide bipartisan/independent observation with transparent public reporting that explains what happened in plain language. At the same time, ensure eligible voters can participate without unnecessary hurdles through well-funded local election offices, accessible polling places, reasonable early and mail options with secure tracking, and accommodations for disabilities. Finally, rebuild confidence through consistent, nonpartisan communication\u2014multilingual voter education, rapid correction of misinformation with receipts and data, and protections for election workers\u2014so communities across the spectrum can see integrity, competence, and accountability in action.",

We should require voter\u2011verified paper records (or paper backups) for all ballots, use strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody and strong cybersecurity, and conduct routine, independent, risk\u2011limiting post\u2011election audits with results reported clearly and promptly. Clear, consistent rules should be applied across jurisdictions, with bipartisan/independent oversight and appropriate access for observers\u2014while also protecting election workers from threats and harassment. At the same time, we must keep voting practical and fair: accessible polling places, reliable early and mail options, accommodations for disabilities, and plain\u2011language, multilingual voter education delivered through trusted local partners (schools, community groups, and faith organizations). By pairing strong integrity safeguards with broad, respectful access and rapid factual communication to counter misinformation, more Americans can feel confident that only eligible votes are counted\u2014and that every eligible vote is counted accurately.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared, practical commitments: make decisions and results verifiable, make rules clear and consistent, and treat every person with dignity. That means using auditable records (like voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent backups), routine independent post-election audits, strong cybersecurity, and strict chain-of-custody\u2014along with transparent, plain-language explanations of how the system works and what safeguards are in place.\n\nTrust also depends on accessibility and fairness: reliable polling locations, early and mail options with clear instructions, accommodations for disabilities, and voter education delivered through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, community groups, veterans\u2019 and faith organizations). Where identification or voter-roll maintenance is used, it should be done in a way that prevents fraud while avoiding unnecessary barriers for eligible voters.\n\nFinally, institutions should communicate quickly and factually, publish audit results, protect election workers, and maintain nonpartisan oversight so people across backgrounds and political views can see\u2014rather than simply be told\u2014that the process is secure, fair, and accountable.",
