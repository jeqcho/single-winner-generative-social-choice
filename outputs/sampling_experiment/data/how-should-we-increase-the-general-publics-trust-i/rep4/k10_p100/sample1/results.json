    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can both participate easily and verify that rules are followed fairly. A practical middle ground is to set clear, consistent standards for ballot security and access: auditable paper records (or voter-verified paper trails), strict chain-of-custody, routine independent risk-limiting audits with publicly released plain-language results, and strong cybersecurity for voter rolls and tabulation systems. At the same time, institutions should reduce barriers by offering reliable options like early and mail voting, accessible polling places, and multilingual, disability-friendly information so eligible voters can take part without confusion or intimidation. Finally, trust improves when oversight is visibly nonpartisan\u2014through bipartisan observers, transparent complaint and error-correction processes, and regular community-facing education led by trusted local partners\u2014so confidence is earned through evidence, accountability, and respectful treatment of every voter.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus less on slogans and more on demonstrated reliability that people can see and verify. That means clear, consistent rules; locally accountable and nonpartisan administration; and systems built for transparency and security at the same time: voter-verified paper records (or equivalent auditable backups), strict chain-of-custody, robust cybersecurity, and routine independent post-election risk-limiting audits with results published promptly in plain language. Trust also grows when participation is practical and fair, so voting options should be accessible (in-person, early, and secure mail where offered), with accommodations for disability and straightforward, multilingual information so every eligible voter understands the process. Finally, institutions should communicate calmly and factually\u2014quickly correcting errors, protecting election workers, and countering misinformation with evidence\u2014so confidence is earned through openness, accountability, and equal treatment under the rules.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few practical commitments that people across backgrounds can see, understand, and verify. First, make key processes transparent and auditable: use reliable paper ballots or voter-verifiable records, apply strict chain-of-custody, and run routine, independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results published quickly in plain language. Second, keep oversight nonpartisan and locally accountable, with clear rules applied consistently and open observation opportunities so concerns are handled with evidence rather than rhetoric. Third, protect both access and security at the same time: convenient options like early and mail voting where secure, reasonable safeguards to ensure eligibility, and well-funded election offices that can staff polling places, reduce long lines, and protect election workers. Finally, invest in ongoing public communication and civic education\u2014especially multilingual, easy-to-read information and trusted community messengers\u2014so families, seniors, and working people can understand how decisions are made, how mistakes are corrected, and why the system deserves confidence.",
