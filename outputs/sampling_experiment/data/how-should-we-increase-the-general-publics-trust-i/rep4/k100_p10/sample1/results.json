Institutions should also make participation and information accessible\u2014multilingual materials, accommodations for disabilities, reliable local staffing, and straightforward ways to ask questions or challenge errors without intimidation. Finally, trust is built locally: partner with schools, libraries, faith and community groups, and other trusted messengers to provide calm, nonpartisan civic education and to correct misinformation with verifiable facts and open data.
