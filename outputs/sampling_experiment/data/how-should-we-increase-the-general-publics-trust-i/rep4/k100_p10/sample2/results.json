    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can see, check, and understand the rules and the results\u2014without having to trust any party\u2019s talking points. A practical middle ground is to standardize clear minimum safeguards nationwide while letting local officials run elections with transparent accountability: paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine risk-limiting audits with bipartisan/public observation, and prompt publication of plain-language, multilingual audit and results reports. At the same time, we should make voting straightforward for eligible voters through accessible polling places, reasonable ID and verification options that don\u2019t block lawful voters, and dependable early and mail voting with tracking and secure handling. Finally, invest in year-round civic education and rapid, factual communication from nonpartisan election offices so misinformation has less room to spread and voters of every background can feel confident that every eligible vote is counted accurately.",

That means clear, consistent rules; secure, auditable paper ballots (or equivalent voter-verifiable records); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine, bipartisan or nonpartisan risk-limiting audits with results published quickly in plain, accessible language. Institutions should be locally accountable and independently overseen, with election workers protected and processes open to constructive public observation. At the same time, sustained civic education and proactive, factual communication (in multiple languages and formats) should explain how safeguards work and correct misinformation without partisanship.
