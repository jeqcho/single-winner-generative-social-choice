    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can clearly see how decisions are made, how mistakes are detected and fixed, and how leaders are held accountable. A practical middle path is to pair strong, consistent safeguards (secure chain-of-custody, cybersecurity, clean and accurate voter rolls, and verifiable records such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable audit trails) with routine independent audits and transparent reporting that is easy to understand. At the same time, institutions should make participation and information accessible\u2014plain-language explanations, multilingual materials, disability accommodations, and multiple safe ways to engage\u2014so security doesn\u2019t become a barrier. Finally, trust is sustained when communication is timely and nonpartisan, frontline staff are protected and trained, and credible community partners (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups) help explain the rules, counter misinformation with facts, and invite public observation without turning oversight into political theater.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in our elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014we should focus on reforms people can see, understand, and independently verify. That means using verifiable paper ballots (or voter-verified paper records), routine independent post\u2011election audits such as risk\u2011limiting audits, strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity protections, and clear, timely public reporting of results and audit findings in plain language. Trust also grows when participation is both secure and practical: convenient early and in\u2011person options, secure mail voting with tracking where used, accessible polling locations, disability accommodations, and clear information in multiple languages so every eligible voter can follow the rules and participate confidently. Finally, election administration should be nonpartisan and locally accountable, with bipartisan/independent observers and well\u2011resourced election offices that communicate calmly, correct errors transparently, and counter misinformation with facts rather than political spin.",
