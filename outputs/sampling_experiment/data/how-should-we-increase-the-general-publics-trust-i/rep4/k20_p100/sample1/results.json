    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when the rules are clear, the work is visible, and mistakes are handled openly. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity safeguards (auditable paper records or voter-verifiable backups, routine risk-limiting audits, secure chain-of-custody, cybersecurity, and transparent voter-roll maintenance) with broad, fair access (reasonable early and mail options, accessible polling places, disability accommodations, and language support). Institutions should publish timely, plain-language explanations of what happened, what was checked, and why results are certified, while welcoming bipartisan and community observation under consistent standards. Finally, leaders and officials must commit to evidence-based communication\u2014correcting misinformation without demonizing voters\u2014so trust is earned through demonstrated competence, accountability, and equal treatment.",

We should make election administration nonpartisan and locally accountable, use auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper backups), conduct routine independent risk-limiting audits with publicly released results, and enforce strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections.\n\nTrust also requires access and clarity: expand convenient, lawful voting options (in-person, early, and secure mail where used), ensure polling places and materials are accessible for people with disabilities, and provide clear, plain-language information in multiple languages so every eligible voter knows how to participate and how results are checked.\n\nFinally, institutions should communicate quickly and factually about problems and fixes, invite bipartisan and community observation, protect election workers, and invest in ongoing civics education so confidence is earned through transparency, accountability, and respectful treatment of every voter\u2014not partisan rhetoric.",

Across agencies\u2014including elections\u2014this means setting clear, consistent rules; publishing plain-language, multilingual information (including Spanish) about what happens and why; and backing claims with evidence people can check, like auditable records, independent reviews, and publicly reported results. Institutions should invest in strong security and privacy protections, train and protect frontline staff, and fix mistakes quickly with transparent explanations and real accountability. At the same time, access must be practical and fair\u2014removing unnecessary barriers, ensuring disability accommodations, and offering user-friendly options that fit working families\u2019 schedules. Finally, trust is strengthened by local, community-based communication through schools, libraries, faith groups, and other trusted messengers, paired with calm, factual responses to misinformation so confidence is earned through demonstrated reliability, not partisan rhetoric.",
