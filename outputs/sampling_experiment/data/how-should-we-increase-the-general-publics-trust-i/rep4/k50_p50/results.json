    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014should be earned through practices people can see, understand, and verify, not through partisan messaging. A durable middle ground is: (1) transparent, standardized procedures that are applied consistently; (2) auditable voting with a voter-verifiable paper record (or equivalent) and routine, independent post-election audits whose results are published in plain language; (3) strong cybersecurity and clear chain-of-custody rules; and (4) broad, practical access so eligible voters can participate without unreasonable burdens, including disability accommodations, reasonable options for early/in-person/mail voting, and multilingual assistance. Where eligibility checks like ID or roll maintenance are used, they should be paired with free, easy ways to comply and safeguards against disenfranchisement. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and honestly about problems and fixes, work with trusted local partners for outreach, and invest in ongoing civic education so the public can evaluate claims and misinformation with confidence.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the system is easy for ordinary people to understand, hard to manipulate, and fair to every eligible voter. We should use auditable paper ballots (or voter-verified paper records), strict chain-of-custody, clean and accurate voter rolls, strong cybersecurity, and routine independent post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) with results published clearly and promptly. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan and bipartisan, with transparent procedures and observers so the public can see the same rules applied everywhere. At the same time, voting must remain accessible\u2014through convenient in\u2011person options, secure mail or early voting where offered, disability accommodations, and clear multilingual, plain\u2011language guidance\u2014so security protects the vote without creating unnecessary barriers. Consistent, factual communication and local community outreach can counter misinformation and show, step by step, how every lawful ballot is protected and counted.",

That means: transparent decision-making and easy-to-find public information in plain language and multiple languages; strong, verifiable safeguards such as voter-verified paper records, secure chain-of-custody, and routine independent audits with results published clearly; and nonpartisan, locally accountable administration with bipartisan/community observation so people can see how outcomes are reached. Institutions should make services accessible and respectful\u2014reasonable hours, disability accommodations, short lines, secure options to participate, and customer-service standards\u2014while promptly acknowledging mistakes, explaining fixes, and protecting frontline workers. Finally, we should invest in practical civic education and trusted local outreach (schools, libraries, faith and community groups) and respond to misinformation with timely facts and evidence. When institutions are understandable, inclusive, and demonstrably honest, trust grows across political, cultural, and generational lines.",
