    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014is earned through transparent, verifiable performance, clear rules, and everyday accessibility, not partisan rhetoric. We should use auditable records (such as voter-verified paper trails), routine independent post-election audits with publicly released results, strong cybersecurity, and strict chain-of-custody so outcomes can be checked and explained. Administration should be nonpartisan and locally accountable, with bipartisan observation and well-trained, well-protected staff, plus prompt, factual communication when problems occur and how they\u2019re fixed. At the same time, voting should remain practical for working families and all eligible citizens: convenient options (early and secure mail where used), accessible polling places, and clear, multilingual, plain-language guidance. Reasonable eligibility safeguards\u2014like accurate voter rolls and, where required by law, voter ID that does not create undue barriers\u2014should be implemented fairly and consistently. By combining security people can verify, access people can use, and communication people can understand, institutions can rebuild confidence that rules are followed and every eligible voice is counted.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should earn confidence through visible, consistent integrity rather than slogans. That means clear, uniform rules; nonpartisan administration with bipartisan and community oversight; and systems that are secure and independently verifiable (paper ballots or voter\u2011verified paper records, strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody, routine risk\u2011limiting audits, and public audit results explained in plain language). Trust also requires fairness and access: convenient voting options, accessible polling places (including disability accommodations), and accurate multilingual information so every eligible voter\u2014including Spanish-speaking households\u2014can understand how to register, vote, and verify that ballots are counted. Institutions should communicate early and honestly about delays, problems, and fixes, protect frontline workers, and publicly correct misinformation with transparent evidence. When people can see the rules, understand the process, and verify outcomes for themselves, trust grows across communities, ages, and political viewpoints.",
