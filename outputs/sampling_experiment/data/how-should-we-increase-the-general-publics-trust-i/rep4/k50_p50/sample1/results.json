    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is rebuilt when people can see, understand, and verify how decisions are made\u2014and when institutions treat everyone with consistent fairness and respect. A practical middle path is to set clear standards for transparency (plain-language explanations, open data where privacy allows, and regular independent audits), accountability (enforceable ethics rules, conflict-of-interest limits, and real consequences for misconduct), and performance (reliable services, timely responses, and measurable goals reported publicly). At the same time, institutions should partner with trusted local organizations to communicate in multiple languages, invite community oversight and feedback, and correct errors openly rather than defensively. When institutions earn credibility through evidence, accessibility, and honest communication\u2014not partisan messaging\u2014more people can disagree on policy yet still trust the process and the people administering it.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy for ordinary people to verify, while treating everyone with fairness and respect. That means clear, consistent rules; transparent processes that can be observed; auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails); routine independent post-election audits with publicly released, plain-language results; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and accountable, nonpartisan administration with bipartisan/community oversight. Trust also grows when access is practical for every eligible person: convenient early and mail options, well-run polling places, disability accommodations, and multilingual information and assistance. Finally, institutions should communicate early and honestly about what went wrong, how it was fixed, and what safeguards are in place\u2014partnering with schools and trusted local organizations to strengthen civic education and reduce misinformation\u2014so confidence is earned through evidence, not spin.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should make them easier to understand, easier to access, and harder to abuse\u2014so trust is earned through consistent, visible performance rather than slogans. That means setting clear, fair rules that apply to everyone; publishing plain-language explanations of decisions and budgets; creating independent oversight with regular public audits; protecting privacy and individual rights; and correcting mistakes quickly and openly. Institutions should also meet people where they are by providing multilingual information, respectful customer-service standards, and real opportunities for local community input\u2014especially for working families, seniors, immigrants, rural residents, and people with disabilities. Finally, leaders and staff should be held to strong ethics standards and protected from harassment, while misinformation is countered with timely facts, transparent data, and civic education. When institutions are transparent, accountable, and responsive in everyday interactions, confidence grows across political and cultural differences.",
