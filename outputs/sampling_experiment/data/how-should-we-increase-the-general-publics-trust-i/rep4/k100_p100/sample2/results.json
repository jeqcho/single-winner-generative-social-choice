    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is rebuilt when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and get honest answers when things go wrong. A practical middle ground is to make public systems more transparent and auditable (clear standards, independent oversight, public reporting in plain language), more accountable (strong ethics rules, conflict-of-interest limits, performance metrics, and real consequences for misconduct), and more inclusive (accessible services, multilingual communication, and meaningful community input). Institutions should also communicate consistently and calmly\u2014sharing what they know, what they don\u2019t, and how errors will be corrected\u2014while protecting privacy and civil liberties. When institutions deliver reliable results, explain them clearly, and invite independent verification, trust is earned over time across political and cultural differences.",

That means clear, consistent rules; secure, auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable records); strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine, independent post-election audits with results published quickly in plain language. Trust also grows when participation is practical and fair: accessible polling places, reasonable options like early voting and secure mail voting with tracking, and voter information available in multiple languages. Finally, institutions should communicate promptly and factually, correct mistakes openly, protect frontline workers from intimidation, and partner with trusted local messengers (schools, libraries, veterans and faith groups, and community organizations) to strengthen civics education and counter misinformation without partisan spin.",

Finally, institutions should meet communities where they are\u2014through schools, libraries, faith groups, veterans\u2019 groups, and local organizations\u2014with nonpartisan civic education and calm, factual responses to misinformation, while protecting election workers and accountability when mistakes happen. When people can participate without unnecessary barriers and can independently confirm that rules were followed and outcomes were checked, confidence in the system can be earned and sustained.",
