We should make key decisions and results easy to verify and explain (plain-language summaries, open data where privacy allows, independent audits and inspectors general, and clear timelines for fixing mistakes), while also making services and participation genuinely accessible (multilingual communication, disability accommodations, consistent rules, and responsive local offices). Institutions should protect frontline workers from harassment, disclose conflicts of interest, enforce ethics rules, and invite structured community oversight\u2014citizen panels, public hearings with real follow-through, and nonpartisan partnerships with trusted local organizations. Finally, leaders and media should commit to correcting misinformation quickly with evidence, not spin. When people can see how decisions are made, how money is spent, and how problems are corrected, confidence can grow across political and cultural lines.",
