    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014improves when people can see, verify, and understand how decisions are made and how rules are enforced consistently. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity safeguards (paper-backed or otherwise auditable records, risk-limiting post-election audits, secure chain-of-custody, cybersecurity hardening, and transparent opportunities for bipartisan and community observation) with broad, fair access (reasonable options to vote, accommodations for disabilities, and clear multilingual guidance on eligibility and procedures). Institutions should publish plain-language reports on results, audits, and any problems found\u2014along with how they were fixed\u2014quickly and without partisan framing. By committing to openness, accountability, and respectful public communication through trusted local messengers like schools, civic groups, and faith or community organizations, we can reduce misinformation and rebuild confidence that the system works for everyone.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014should be earned through transparent, verifiable, and fair processes that people can see and understand. That means secure, auditable systems with paper records or equivalent voter-verifiable backups; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; routine, publicly reported post-election audits (e.g., risk-limiting audits) with bipartisan and independent oversight; and clear, plain-language explanations of how results are counted and checked. Trust also grows when participation is practical and equitable: accurate voter rolls, accessible polling options that reduce long lines, and multilingual, nonpartisan voter education delivered through trusted local partners like schools, community groups, and faith organizations. By pairing strong safeguards with open communication and respectful community oversight, institutions can demonstrate integrity, correct errors quickly, and reduce misinformation\u2014so people across viewpoints can have confidence that outcomes reflect eligible voters\u2019 choices.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on the same basics people expect from any system that affects their lives: clear rules, independent oversight, and proof that the rules are followed. That means secure, auditable processes (such as paper records or voter-verifiable backups), routine post-event audits with results published in plain language, strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections, and firm consequences for misconduct or threats against public workers. Trust also grows when participation is straightforward and respectful: accurate voter rolls, reasonable identity verification where needed alongside accessible options for eligible voters, shorter lines, disability accommodations, and multilingual information (including Spanish and other locally used languages). Finally, institutions should communicate early and often with timely facts, open data where appropriate, and partnerships with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, community groups, faith organizations, veterans\u2019 groups, and local media\u2014so people can understand how decisions are made and verify outcomes for themselves.",
