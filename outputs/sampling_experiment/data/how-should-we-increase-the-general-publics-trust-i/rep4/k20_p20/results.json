    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014rises when people can see, verify, and understand how decisions are made and how mistakes are corrected. A strong middle-ground approach is to pair secure, auditable systems (paper-backed records, clear chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and independent security reviews) with broad, practical access for eligible participants (convenient voting options, disability accommodations, and multilingual information). Institutions should publish plain-language, timely explanations of rules, results, and audit findings; invite bipartisan and community observation; protect workers and participants from intimidation; and enforce consistent standards while allowing local accountability. By focusing on transparency, evidence, fair access, and nonpartisan oversight\u2014rather than partisan messaging\u2014institutions can demonstrate integrity and earn durable public confidence.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections is earned through evidence people can see: transparent, secure, and verifiable voting that is also accessible to every eligible voter. We should use voter-verifiable paper records (or auditable paper backups), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent post\u2011election audits (including risk-limiting audits) with results released publicly in plain language. Clear, consistent rules and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight\u2014plus room for trained observers\u2014help ensure accountability without politicizing administration. Finally, invest in practical, multilingual voter education and timely fact-based communication so communities understand how ballots are cast, protected, counted, and checked, reducing misinformation while keeping participation straightforward and fair.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on rules and results people can see, verify, and understand. That means secure, auditable systems (paper records or equivalent), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine post-election audits with findings published quickly in plain language. Institutions should communicate early and often\u2014fact-based, nonpartisan, and in multiple languages\u2014so families, workers, and young people can follow how decisions are made and how problems are corrected. Access matters too: convenient hours and locations, reasonable accommodations, and well-trained staff who are protected from harassment, so eligible people can participate without confusion or long lines. Finally, accountability must be real: independent oversight, clear standards, and transparent consequences for errors or misconduct, so confidence comes from evidence\u2014not from politics.",
