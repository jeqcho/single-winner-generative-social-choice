    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and influence how decisions are made\u2014and when rules are applied consistently and fairly. Institutions should make key processes transparent and independently verifiable (clear standards, open data where possible, regular third\u2011party audits, and public reporting in plain language), while protecting privacy and civil rights. They should also invest in reliable service delivery\u2014competent staffing, strong cybersecurity, accessible facilities and digital tools, and clear channels for complaints with real consequences for misconduct. Finally, trust is strengthened by ongoing two\u2011way engagement: multilingual communication, partnerships with trusted local community leaders, and opportunities for residents to participate in oversight and improvement\u2014so accountability is visible and everyone feels respected and included.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should rely on practices people can verify rather than partisan assurances. That means clear and consistent rules; secure systems with a paper ballot or other durable, auditable record; strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections; and routine, independent audits (including risk-limiting audits) with results released promptly and in plain language. Oversight should be nonpartisan and transparent, with bipartisan and independent observers and well-resourced local administrators who are accountable to the public. At the same time, access must be real for every eligible person: reliable polling-place operations, reasonable voting options, disability accommodations, and accurate multilingual information so all communities understand how to register, vote, and confirm that ballots are counted. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often about procedures, problems, and fixes\u2014so misinformation has less room to grow and people feel respected, included, and confident in the outcome.",

That means secure, auditable systems (such as paper ballots or durable audit trails), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible) with results published promptly in plain language. Trust also requires real accessibility: well-run polling places, reasonable options for in-person and mail voting, disability access, and accurate information in Spanish and other commonly used languages so families aren\u2019t left behind or confused. Oversight should be visibly nonpartisan\u2014using bipartisan or cross-partisan observation, independent inspectors/auditors, and empowered local administrators\u2014so no party is \u201cgrading its own homework.\u201d Finally, institutions should communicate early and honestly about problems and fixes, invest in civic education that counters misinformation without censorship, and treat every voter with respect.
