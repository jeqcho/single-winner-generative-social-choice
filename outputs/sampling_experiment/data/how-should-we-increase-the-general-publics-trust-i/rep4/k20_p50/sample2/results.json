    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus less on slogans and more on practices people can see, understand, and verify. That means clear and consistent rules, strong security and privacy protections, and routine independent audits (with paper records or other durable, auditable evidence) so results can be checked and explained. At the same time, access must be practical for every eligible person: well-run polling places, reasonable options for early or mail voting with tracking where feasible, disability accommodations, and accurate multilingual information. Trust also grows when institutions communicate plainly and quickly about problems and fixes, publish data and procedures in plain language, invite bipartisan and community observation, and hold officials accountable for mistakes\u2014without politicizing the administrators who do the work.",

That means clear and consistent rules; nonpartisan, locally accountable administration; secure chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity; and routine, transparent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits) backed by voter-verifiable paper records. Trust also grows when institutions communicate early and often in plain language, publish timely results with clear explanations of how they were reached, and acknowledge problems openly with documented fixes. Finally, institutions should make participation practical and fair\u2014accessible polling places and reasonable voting options, language assistance where needed, well-trained staff, and sustained civics education and community outreach through trusted local partners\u2014so integrity and inclusion reinforce each other.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make rules and decisions easy to understand, easy to verify, and consistently applied to everyone. That means transparent procedures, clear and timely public reporting, and routine independent audits or oversight that the public can observe and check, along with strong cybersecurity and well-documented chain-of-custody for sensitive records. Trust also requires fairness and access: services and voting information should be available in plain language and in the languages people use at home (including Spanish), with practical accommodations for seniors, people with disabilities, rural communities, and working families. Institutions should invest in well-trained local staff, publish simple \u201chow it works\u201d explanations, respond quickly and calmly to mistakes and misinformation with facts, and invite community partners\u2014schools, faith groups, veterans\u2019 groups, and nonpartisan civic organizations\u2014to help share accurate information. When people can see the rules, see the checks, and see respectful treatment in every community, confidence grows even when we disagree about politics.",
