We should pair strong integrity safeguards (auditable paper records or equivalent verifiable trails, routine independent post-election audits, strict chain-of-custody, and hardened cybersecurity) with broad, lawful access (well-run polling places, accessible options for people with disabilities, and clear registration and voting procedures). Institutions should communicate early and often in plain language and multiple languages, publish audit methods and results in user-friendly formats, and correct mistakes transparently with real consequences when standards aren\u2019t met. Finally, partnering with trusted local leaders (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups, veterans, and community organizations) to provide nonpartisan civic education and timely fact-checking can reduce misinformation and help people judge performance by shared facts rather than partisan claims.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in U.S. elections, we should make the process easy to understand, easy to access for every eligible voter, and easy to verify with evidence. That means using auditable ballot records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent post-election risk-limiting audits with results published promptly in plain language. Election rules and procedures should be administered consistently by well-funded, nonpartisan professionals with bipartisan public oversight, and officials should communicate quickly and calmly to correct mistakes and counter misinformation with documented facts. Finally, trust grows when participation is practical for working families, rural and urban communities, people with disabilities, and multilingual voters\u2014through clear voter education, language access, reasonable polling options (including early and secure mail voting where offered), and transparent reporting that shows how results are checked and certified.",
