    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is rebuilt when people can see how decisions are made, verify outcomes, and experience fair, respectful treatment regardless of politics or background. We should set clear, consistent rules; publish plain-language data and explanations; and use independent oversight (including audits and ethics enforcement) so mistakes and misconduct are found and fixed openly. Institutions also need accessible, multilingual communication; strong protections for privacy and civil rights; and real opportunities for community input through local forums and partnerships with trusted civic groups. When leaders are held accountable, information is timely and understandable, and services work reliably for everyone, trust can be earned and sustained.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can clearly see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and results are independently verified. We should use auditable paper ballots or voter-verifiable records, routine risk-limiting post-election audits, and strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, with bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight that is accountable at the local level. At the same time, participation should be practical and accessible for every eligible voter through well-run polling places, early voting and secure mail options where offered, and clear accommodations for seniors and people with disabilities. Election officials should publish timely, plain-language reports of procedures, audit results, and fixes when problems occur, and invest in civics education and multilingual outreach so families can understand how voting works and misinformation has less room to spread. When institutions operate transparently, communicate calmly and factually, and welcome independent verification, confidence is earned across political and community lines.",

That means setting clear, consistent rules; using auditable records (like paper ballots or voter-verified trails); conducting routine, independent post-election audits with bipartisan oversight; and maintaining strong cybersecurity and strict chain-of-custody so mistakes and tampering are prevented and caught quickly. Trust also grows when access is real: convenient in-person, early, and secure mail options; accessible polling places; and clear, multilingual, plain-language information so busy families, seniors, people with disabilities, and communities where English isn\u2019t the first language can participate confidently. Finally, institutions should communicate promptly and calmly, publish audit findings and fixes transparently, and invest in ongoing civics education and local community outreach\u2014so trust is earned through visible evidence and accountability, not partisan claims.",
