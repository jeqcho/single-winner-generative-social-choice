    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see that the rules are fair, applied consistently, and backed by evidence rather than partisan claims. We should strengthen transparency and accountability with voter-verifiable ballots (such as paper records), routine independent risk-limiting audits, and clear chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, with audit results published promptly in plain language. At the same time, access should be protected through well-run polling places, secure early and mail options, disability accommodations, and multilingual information so eligible voters can participate without confusion or unnecessary barriers. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and calmly about problems and fixes, invite bipartisan and community observation, and invest in ongoing civics education so confidence is earned through understandable processes and demonstrated integrity.",

We should strengthen transparency and verifiability through voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent auditable records, routine independent risk-limiting post-election audits, strict chain-of-custody procedures, and strong cybersecurity for voter rolls and tabulation systems, with bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight at every stage. Just as important, institutions must communicate in plain, timely language (and in multiple languages where needed), publish audit findings and explanations that ordinary people can understand, and respond quickly and calmly to mistakes and misinformation with evidence.

That means clear, consistent rules; transparent processes with strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; routine independent audits with results published quickly in plain language; and well-funded, nonpartisan administration with bipartisan and community observation. Trust also grows when access is real: convenient voting options, disability accommodations, reliable polling locations, and multilingual information (including Spanish and other commonly used languages) so families can participate confidently. Finally, institutions should communicate early and honestly about problems and fixes, strengthen civics education through schools and local organizations, and respond to misinformation with calm, factual, evidence-based updates\u2014so confidence is earned through openness, accountability, and equal treatment for all eligible residents.",
