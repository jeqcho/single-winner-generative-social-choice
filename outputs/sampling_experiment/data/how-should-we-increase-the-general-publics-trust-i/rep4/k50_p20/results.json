    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the system is both easy to use and easy to verify. We should rely on paper-based records (or paper backups) for every ballot, routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits), strong cybersecurity, and strict chain-of-custody so results can be checked and confirmed. At the same time, voting should remain broadly accessible through safe in-person options, early voting, and secure mail voting, with clear, consistent rules that prevent discrimination and avoid unnecessary barriers. Election offices should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, publish timely audit results and explanations, and partner with schools, libraries, and local community groups to improve civics knowledge and reduce misinformation. With nonpartisan administration and transparent oversight, people across perspectives can see that elections are fair, secure, and worthy of confidence.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on processes that are transparent, consistently applied, and independently verifiable. That means paper-based records or paper backups where relevant, strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity safeguards, and routine, nonpartisan post\u2011process audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) with results reported publicly and in plain language. At the same time, access should be broad and fair: reliable polling places, secure early and mail options where used, and clear accommodations for seniors, people with disabilities, and voters who need multilingual information. Trust also grows when local officials communicate calmly, promptly, and factually, and when communities invest in civics education and outreach through schools, libraries, and local organizations to reduce confusion and counter misinformation. By combining security, accessibility, and clear accountability, institutions can earn confidence across different communities and political viewpoints.",
