Institutions should also rely on local, community-facing messengers\u2014libraries, schools, civic groups, and trusted public servants\u2014so information is timely, factual, and not filtered through partisan conflict. If institutions are transparent, accountable, and respectful of everyone\u2019s rights and dignity, trust can be earned across ideological lines.",

We should pair strong security (voter-verified paper records, strict chain-of-custody, cybersecurity, and routine risk-limiting post-election audits) with broad, nondiscriminatory access (early and mail options where allowed, accessible polling places, and clear multilingual guidance). Administration should be nonpartisan and locally accountable, adequately funded and trained, and supported by bipartisan and community oversight with audit findings and key data released in plain language. Finally, timely, factual communication and ongoing civics education through schools, libraries, and trusted community partners can reduce misinformation and help people understand not just who won, but how we know the outcome is accurate.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially election systems\u2014we should make key decisions and outcomes transparent, verifiable, and easy for everyday people to understand, while treating everyone with dignity and ensuring fair access. That means clear, consistent rules; strong protections against fraud and interference; and independent oversight that includes bipartisan and community representation. For elections specifically, use auditable records (such as voter-verified paper trails), secure chain-of-custody, and routine post-election risk-limiting audits with results published promptly in plain language and multiple languages. Invest in well-trained local staff, modern cybersecurity, and safe working conditions for public employees, and provide practical civic education through schools, libraries, and trusted community groups so families, seniors, and first-time voters can see how the system works. When institutions show their work, admit mistakes, correct them openly, and communicate facts quickly and respectfully, trust can grow across political and cultural differences.",
