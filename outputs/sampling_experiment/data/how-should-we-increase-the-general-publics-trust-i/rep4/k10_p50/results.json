We can rebuild confidence by making decisions and results easy for the public to verify: publish plain-language explanations of how policies are made and how money is spent; open key data and evaluation methods to independent review; enforce consistent ethics standards with real consequences; and create regular public reporting that shows what worked, what failed, and what will change. Institutions should also make access fair and practical\u2014offering multilingual communication, disability accommodations, and predictable, customer-service-focused processes\u2014while partnering with trusted local messengers (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups) to answer questions and counter misinformation without spin. When people can see the evidence, understand the process, and watch corrections happen in the open, trust can grow across communities.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in our elections\u2014and in the institutions that run them\u2014grows when people can see clear evidence that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and every eligible voter can participate without unnecessary barriers. We should use verifiable voting systems (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable records), routine independent risk-limiting post-election audits, strict chain-of-custody procedures, and strong cybersecurity for voter rolls and tabulation. Election administration should be nonpartisan and well-funded, with transparent public reporting that explains, in plain language, how ballots are cast, counted, checked, and certified. To serve all communities, official information and assistance should be accessible and multilingual, polling places should be reliable and disability-accessible, and ongoing civics education and community outreach through trusted local institutions can counter misinformation and help people understand what safeguards are in place. Trust is earned through openness, accountability, and consistent performance\u2014not partisan rhetoric.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on practical steps people can see, verify, and understand: clear rules applied consistently, secure and auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable backups), routine independent post-election audits with publicly posted results, strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections, and well-trained, well-protected staff. Trust also grows when institutions communicate early and often in plain language and multiple languages, make participation genuinely accessible (including for working families, people with disabilities, and rural communities), and respond quickly and transparently when problems occur. Finally, partnering with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, community groups, and faith or cultural organizations\u2014can improve civic understanding, reduce misinformation, and show that institutions are accountable to the public rather than to any party or special interest.",
