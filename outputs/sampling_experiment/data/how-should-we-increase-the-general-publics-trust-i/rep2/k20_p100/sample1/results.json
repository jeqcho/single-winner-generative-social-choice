    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and get answers without spin. We should make transparency routine (open data, plain-language explanations, and clear records of who decided what and why), strengthen independent oversight (inspectors general, audits, ethics enforcement, and protected whistleblowers), and set consistent service standards so help is timely, respectful, and accessible in every community. Institutions should invite the public into the process through local listening sessions, citizen advisory panels, and meaningful complaint-and-appeals paths that show how problems are investigated and fixed. Finally, trust requires accountability and competence: clear performance metrics, consequences for misconduct, protection of privacy and civil liberties, and stable funding and training so frontline workers can do their jobs well. When institutions are transparent, responsive, and willing to correct mistakes, more people will accept outcomes\u2014even when they disagree with them.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the rules are clear, the evidence is visible, and the outcome can be independently verified. We should standardize core safeguards: paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), strict chain-of-custody documentation, and routine independent risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language. Administration should be nonpartisan and locally accountable, with bipartisan and public observation that protects ballot privacy and the dignity of voters and election workers. Trust also depends on access that works for real life\u2014reliable polling places and hours, secure early voting and mail options with tracking where used, and accommodations for disabilities\u2014paired with multilingual, easy-to-find explanations through schools, libraries, community groups, and local media. By combining verifiable security, transparent reporting, and practical accessibility, we make it easier for people across views and communities to accept results\u2014even when their side loses.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including election systems\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability, not partisan spin. We should design public processes to be transparent and verifiable: use paper-backed records where feasible, publish plain-language step-by-step explanations of how decisions and results are reached, and require independent audits and public reporting so anyone can confirm the work was done correctly. At the same time, institutions must be accessible and responsive\u2014offering services and participation options that work for people with different schedules and needs, providing disability accommodations, and sharing information in the languages communities actually use (including Spanish), with simple visuals and easy ways to ask questions and get timely answers. Finally, rebuilding trust requires investing in professional staff, strong cybersecurity and privacy protections, fair enforcement of rules, and community partnerships (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups) that support nonpartisan education and quickly correct misinformation. When institutions are open, consistent, and respectful of every person\u2019s dignity, confidence can be earned and sustained\u2014even when we disagree on outcomes.",
