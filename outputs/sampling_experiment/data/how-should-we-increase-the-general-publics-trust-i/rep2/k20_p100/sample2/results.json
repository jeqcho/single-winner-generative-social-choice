    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify the evidence behind them, and hold leaders accountable without feeling dismissed. A practical middle ground is to pair transparency with privacy: publish clear standards, budgets, performance metrics, and audit results in plain language (and multiple languages), while protecting personal data and due process. Institutions should invite independent oversight\u2014inspectors general, bipartisan or cross-partisan review panels, and community advisory boards with real access to information\u2014and create reliable channels for reporting problems, investigating them quickly, and publicly explaining what changed as a result. Just as important, everyday service must improve: consistent rules, fair enforcement, competent staffing, and respectful communication that separates facts from opinion. By showing their work, correcting mistakes openly, and engaging local trusted partners (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups), institutions can earn confidence across political lines and restore a shared sense that the system is both fair and accountable.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in our elections\u2014and in the institutions that run them\u2014grows when people can see, verify, and understand that the same fair rules are followed for everyone. We should use auditable paper ballots or voter\u2011verifiable paper records, conduct routine risk\u2011limiting and other independent post\u2011election audits, and publish plain\u2011language results and audit reports quickly so the public can confirm outcomes. Secure chain\u2011of\u2011custody procedures, strong cybersecurity, well\u2011trained and well\u2011funded local election offices, and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with meaningful public observation should be standard. At the same time, voting must remain accessible to working people, seniors, and voters with disabilities through reliable polling places, reasonable hours, early voting, and secure mail/absentee options with clear verification and ballot\u2011status tracking where available. Finally, sustained nonpartisan civics and media\u2011literacy education\u2014delivered through schools, libraries, community and faith organizations, and multilingual materials\u2014can counter misinformation and help neighbors evaluate evidence, ask questions, and accept verified results even when their preferred side loses.",

    "new_statement": "We can rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014by making the rules clear, the work verifiable, and the results easy for ordinary people to check. That means using auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), routine independent post\u2011election audits (including risk\u2011limiting audits where feasible), strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity protections, and well\u2011trained, nonpartisan staff with bipartisan and public observation at key steps. Trust also depends on fair access: reliable polling places, reasonable hours, safe early voting, and secure mail/absentee options with tracking and clear instructions, plus disability accommodations. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often in plain language\u2014through local media, schools, libraries, community and faith groups\u2014and provide multilingual information (including Spanish) that explains what happened, how problems are investigated, and how corrections are made. When people can see the safeguards, understand them, and participate without unnecessary barriers, confidence grows even when we don\u2019t all agree on politics.",
