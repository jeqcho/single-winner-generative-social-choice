    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied consistently, and experience fair treatment\u2014especially when outcomes are contested. We should set clear, publicly posted standards for major decisions; publish plain-language explanations, data, and independent evaluations; and create routine, transparent oversight that includes bipartisan participation and nonpartisan experts, with strong protections for privacy and civil liberties. Institutions also need practical accessibility: easy-to-use services, language and disability access, predictable timelines, and clear ways to ask questions, appeal decisions, and report problems without retaliation. Finally, leaders and communicators should correct mistakes quickly, distinguish facts from uncertainty, and engage local community partners (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups) to share verified information\u2014so trust is earned through openness, competence, and accountability rather than slogans.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when the rules are clear, the work is professional, and the public can independently verify outcomes without partisan spin. We should standardize a core set of transparent safeguards: verifiable paper ballots (or paper-backed records), strict chain-of-custody documentation, routine risk-limiting post\u2011election audits with results published promptly, and bipartisan/independent oversight that is open to lawful observation. At the same time, institutions must make participation practical and fair by ensuring accessible polling places, reasonable early voting options, and secure, trackable absentee or mail voting for those who need it, while protecting privacy and enforcing uniform rules.\n\nTrust also depends on communication: officials, local media, schools, libraries, and community organizations should provide plain-language, multilingual explanations of how decisions are made, how ballots are counted and certified, and how problems are reported and resolved. By pairing verifiable procedures with calm, timely public reporting and strong defenses against cyber threats and deliberate misinformation, institutions can show\u2014rather than just claim\u2014that they are accountable to the public and worthy of confidence.",

Trust also depends on practical access: reliable polling places, reasonable early voting and secure absentee/mail options where used, disability accommodations, and clear avenues for voters to check ballot status and report concerns. Finally, institutions should communicate calmly and quickly in plain language\u2014through local newspapers, libraries, schools, and community organizations\u2014correcting misinformation with evidence, explaining how issues are investigated and resolved, and treating election workers and voters with dignity. When people can verify outcomes for themselves and feel respected by the process, confidence increases even when their preferred candidates lose.",
