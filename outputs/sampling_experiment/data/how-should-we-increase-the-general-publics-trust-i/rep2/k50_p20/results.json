A practical middle ground is to strengthen transparency and independent oversight (clear standards, public reporting, and regular third-party audits), while improving everyday service and access so the system feels fair to everyone, not just insiders. Institutions should communicate in plain language through trusted local channels, provide multilingual and disability-accessible information, protect privacy, and create easy ways for residents to ask questions and get timely answers. Finally, leaders should commit to ethical rules that limit conflicts of interest and political interference, invest in staff and secure infrastructure, and respond to misinformation with verifiable evidence rather than partisan attacks, so trust is earned through consistent performance over time.",
