    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that rules are fair, decisions are evidence-based, and mistakes are found and fixed without partisan spin. We should set clear, consistently applied standards; publish plain-language explanations of how decisions are made and how money is spent; and expand independent oversight such as audits, inspectors general, and bipartisan or cross-community review boards with real enforcement power. Institutions should make basic performance data easy to access, protect privacy and civil liberties, and create reliable ways for the public to ask questions, appeal decisions, and report wrongdoing\u2014paired with strong whistleblower protections. Finally, rebuilding trust requires ongoing local engagement: partnering with schools, libraries, faith groups, and community organizations to share verified information in multiple languages, train frontline staff to treat people with dignity, and correct errors quickly and publicly.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make core decisions and results transparent, verifiable, and easy for ordinary people to understand. That means using auditable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), conducting routine independent risk-limiting audits, maintaining clear chain-of-custody documentation, and publishing timely, plain-language reports of procedures, audit findings, and any problems found and fixed. Administration should be professionally run and protected from partisan pressure, with bipartisan and independent observation, consistent and clearly communicated rules, and stable funding so local officials can do the job well. Trust also grows when people can access the system fairly: strong accessibility for voters with disabilities, reliable early/mail options with secure verification, and multilingual voter information delivered through trusted community channels (schools, libraries, local media, and community organizations). Finally, we should invest in nonpartisan civic education and proactive, fact-based communication so people can judge evidence over rumor while protecting civil liberties and the dignity of every voter.",

Trust also grows when institutions communicate in plain language and in the languages people use at home, partner with trusted local messengers (schools, libraries, faith groups, community organizations), and provide respectful ways for residents to ask questions and observe or verify processes without intimidation. Finally, institutions must earn confidence through everyday competence: reliable funding and staffing, strong cybersecurity and privacy protections, equal access for seniors and people with disabilities, and consistent accountability for mistakes and for deliberate misinformation\u2014so people can judge evidence over rumor and feel that the system treats everyone with dignity.",
