For elections, that means transparent and consistent procedures: secure, auditable paper ballots (or verifiable backups), strict chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine risk-limiting post\u2011election audits with results published in plain language. Administration should be nonpartisan and professionally accountable, with bipartisan/independent oversight and clear, evenly applied standards across jurisdictions where practical. Trust also depends on equal, accessible participation\u2014safe and convenient voting options, disability access, and multilingual assistance\u2014paired with ongoing civics education and calm, factual responses to misinformation so voters don\u2019t have to rely on rumors to know their vote was counted accurately.",

That means paper-backed or otherwise auditable records, strict chain-of-custody, routine independent risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language, and nonpartisan (and where appropriate bipartisan) oversight so the public doesn\u2019t have to rely on anyone\u2019s word alone. Trust also grows when institutions make participation straightforward and fair\u2014reasonable access for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and underserved communities\u2014paired with practical, multilingual information from trusted local officials and community partners. Finally, institutions should respond quickly and calmly to misinformation, explain decisions and data openly, protect privacy, and enforce rules evenly, so people can feel confident the process is both honest and respectful.",
