We should standardize transparent, nonpartisan administration with verifiable records (such as auditable paper ballots or paper backups), strict chain-of-custody, and routine risk-limiting audits overseen by bipartisan and independent observers, with timely public reporting of results and any discrepancies. At the same time, institutions should ensure equal, practical access and privacy protections, invest in consistent funding for local offices, and provide plain-language civic education and easily found online explanations of safeguards to reduce confusion and misinformation. By combining integrity, transparency, accessibility, and straightforward communication, we make it easier for people across the political spectrum to trust that outcomes reflect the public\u2019s true will.",

Trust also grows when institutions treat people with dignity and make services accessible: consistent rules, strong privacy protections, language access (including Spanish), and straightforward ways for communities to ask questions, observe processes, and get answers without partisan spin.
