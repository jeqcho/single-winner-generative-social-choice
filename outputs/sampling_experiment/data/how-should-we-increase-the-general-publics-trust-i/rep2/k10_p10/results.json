    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, how money is spent, and how mistakes are found and fixed. A practical middle ground is to set clear, nonpartisan standards for transparency and accountability across government and civic systems: publish understandable data and rationales for major decisions, use independent oversight and routine audits, protect privacy while enabling public verification, and enforce consistent ethics and anti-corruption rules. Institutions should also invest in plain-language communication, open meetings and records that are easy to access, and meaningful public input\u2014especially from communities that feel ignored\u2014while responding quickly and factually to concerns and misinformation. By combining openness, fair rules, and reliable performance, we can rebuild confidence without turning governance into partisan theater.",

That means using simple, observable safeguards like auditable paper records, strong chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and independent, bipartisan oversight, with clear timelines and plain-language explanations of results and any discrepancies. Trust also depends on access and respect: ensure every eligible person can participate through reliable polling options, language access, and outreach, while protecting privacy and security. By combining verifiable procedures with transparency, nonpartisan administration, and civic education that counters misinformation, institutions can earn confidence through what the public can see, understand, and check.",
