    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and verify how decisions are made\u2014and when institutions prove, through consistent behavior, that the same rules apply to everyone. We should set clear, publicly posted standards for performance and ethics; publish plain-language explanations of major decisions; release timely data and independent evaluations (including audits and investigations) with protections for privacy; and make it easy for the public to report problems and track how they are resolved. Institutions should invest in strong frontline service\u2014well-trained staff, accessible hours, and language and disability access\u2014so people experience competence and respect in everyday interactions. Finally, leaders must enforce real accountability for misconduct, reduce conflicts of interest, and partner with trusted local community organizations for nonpartisan public education and feedback. Trust won\u2019t return through slogans, but through verifiable transparency, fair enforcement, and reliable service over time.",

At the same time, voting should be accessible to working families, seniors, and people with disabilities through well-run polling places, early voting, and secure mail options with trackable status, alongside strong cybersecurity for voter rolls and tally systems. Finally, consistent, nonpartisan voter education\u2014shared through schools, libraries, and trusted local community partners in multiple languages\u2014can answer questions, correct misinformation quickly, and help neighbors understand and accept results even when their preferred side loses.",

Trust also depends on real access: convenient voting options for working families, accessible polling places and accommodations for people with disabilities, and easy-to-find information in plain language and multiple languages (including Spanish) so every community can understand how the system works. Finally, institutions should earn confidence through steady, nonpartisan communication, support and protection for frontline workers, partnerships with trusted local organizations (schools, libraries, community and faith groups) for civic education, and respectful channels for questions and complaints\u2014so people feel heard while outcomes remain evidence-based and verifiable.",
