    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify results independently, and experience fair, respectful treatment\u2014especially when outcomes are inconvenient or controversial. A practical middle ground is to require clear, consistently applied rules; publish simple, plain-language explanations of procedures, data, and tradeoffs; and build in independent oversight that includes nonpartisan experts, bipartisan representation, and ordinary residents. Institutions should proactively disclose performance metrics and mistakes, explain how errors are corrected, protect privacy and civil liberties, and create easy ways for the public to ask questions and get timely, documented answers. Finally, steady investment in frontline staff, strong cybersecurity and recordkeeping, and ongoing civic and media literacy education\u2014delivered through trusted local partners like libraries, schools, faith groups, and community organizations\u2014can reduce misinformation and help trust be earned through observable accountability rather than slogans.",

Just as important, election officials and trusted community partners (schools, libraries, local organizations) should provide timely, plain\u2011language explanations of how voting and counting work, clear channels for questions and reporting issues, and multilingual, accessible materials that include disability accommodations. By pairing verifiable security with practical access options (reliable polling places, early voting, and secure mail voting where used) and calm, factual communication that corrects misinformation quickly, we can rebuild confidence across communities\u2014even when the outcome is disappointing to some.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make key decisions and outcomes easy to verify, easy to understand, and fair in practice. That means using auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), routine independent post\u2011election audits (including risk\u2011limiting audits where appropriate), strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity protections, and clear, timely public reporting of results and any issues found and fixed. Trust also grows when access is real: reliable polling locations, reasonable early voting hours, secure absentee/mail options with tracking where used, and strong accommodations for people with disabilities and workers with inflexible schedules. Finally, institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, partner with trusted local schools, libraries, community and faith groups for nonpartisan education, and protect the dignity, privacy, and safety of voters and frontline workers. When people can see the rules, understand them, and independently confirm outcomes\u2014regardless of party\u2014confidence rises and our shared civic life becomes more stable.",
