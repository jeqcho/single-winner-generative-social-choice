    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify outcomes, and expect the same fair rules to apply to everyone. We should commit to transparent standards, independent oversight, and regular public reporting that explains what was done, why it was done, what went wrong (if anything), and how it was fixed\u2014using plain language, open data where feasible, and clear channels to ask questions and appeal decisions. Institutions should protect privacy and civil liberties while strengthening security and accountability, and they should make participation practical for ordinary life through accessible services, consistent procedures, and respectful treatment for every community. Finally, rebuilding trust requires investing in civic and media literacy, partnering with trusted local organizations for nonpartisan education, and holding leaders and staff to professional ethics so honesty, competence, and responsiveness become the norm rather than the exception.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in our elections grows when the process is secure, transparent, and easy for ordinary people to verify and understand. We should use paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records, conduct routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible), and maintain strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections from registration through certification. Election officials should publish timely, plain-language explanations of how ballots are counted, what checks are performed, and how any problems are investigated and corrected, with bipartisan and nonpartisan observers able to monitor key steps. At the same time, voting should remain accessible\u2014through well-run polling places, reasonable early voting, and secure mail or absentee options with clear tracking and privacy protections\u2014so working families, people with disabilities, and multilingual communities can participate confidently. Pairing verifiable safeguards with consistent rules, adequate funding for local election offices, and ongoing civics and media-literacy education can reduce misinformation and help more Americans accept results, even when their preferred candidate loses.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can plainly see that decisions are made fairly, the same rules apply to everyone, and independent checks catch and correct mistakes. We should strengthen transparency and accountability by using verifiable records (such as paper ballots or auditable paper trails), routine risk\u2011limiting post\u2011election audits, strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody procedures, and independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight with publicly posted findings. At the same time, institutions must protect privacy, treat workers and the public with respect, and make participation practical for real life: accessible polling places and accommodations for disabilities, reasonable early voting options, and secure, trackable mail/absentee voting where offered. Trust also depends on clear communication\u2014timely updates, plain\u2011language explanations of how counting and certification work, and multilingual information (including Spanish and other common community languages) shared through trusted local channels like schools, libraries, community groups, faith communities, and local media. By pairing strong security with equal access and calm, evidence\u2011based public reporting, institutions can earn confidence across communities and political viewpoints, even when people disagree on outcomes.",
