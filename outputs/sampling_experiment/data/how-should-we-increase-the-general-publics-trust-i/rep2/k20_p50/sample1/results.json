    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and get honest answers when things go wrong. Institutions should publish clear standards and data in plain language, invite independent oversight (including routine audits and public reporting), and protect privacy while making key processes observable and reviewable. They should also improve everyday access\u2014through reliable service, responsive staff, and accommodations such as language access, disability access, and hours that work for working families\u2014so trust is built through lived experience, not just announcements. Finally, leaders should commit to consistent enforcement and accountability regardless of party or status, quickly correct mistakes, and support nonpartisan civic education and community partnerships that help people separate evidence from rumor.",

We should build confidence through transparent, auditable procedures: voter-verifiable paper ballots (or equivalent paper-backed records), strict chain-of-custody, routine independent risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language, and strong cybersecurity and physical security. Access also matters: reliable early voting and secure absentee/mail options with tracking, accessible polling places for seniors and people with disabilities, and clear information in the languages communities use. Finally, trust is strengthened by nonpartisan administration, well-trained and protected election workers, bipartisan/independent observers, timely explanations when problems occur, and sustained civic education through schools, libraries, and community and faith organizations so people can judge evidence over rumor\u2014even when their side loses.",

We should build trust with practical, verifiable safeguards (paper-backed records where appropriate, strong chain-of-custody, cybersecurity, and routine independent audits that are publicly reported in plain language), plus consistent standards and well-trained, well-supported frontline workers who can do their jobs without intimidation. At the same time, institutions must be accessible and responsive: straightforward information shared through trusted local channels (schools, libraries, community groups, faith communities, and local media), language and disability access, and service hours/processes that work for working families and seniors. Finally, when mistakes happen, leaders should acknowledge them quickly, explain what changed, and invite independent review\u2014so confidence is earned through openness, evidence, and equal enforcement of the rules, not through political spin.",
