    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when rules are predictable, decisions are explainable, and outcomes can be independently checked. For elections, that means a verifiable record for every ballot (such as paper or an auditable equivalent), routine risk-limiting audits with publicly posted results, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and clear standards that are applied consistently while still allowing local officials to run elections with professional, nonpartisan training and accountability. At the same time, participation should be practical for working families, people with disabilities, and rural and urban communities through well-managed early voting, secure mail or drop options where used, and transparent wait-time and staffing plans. Finally, institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, partner with trusted community organizations, and respond quickly with evidence when misinformation spreads\u2014so people don\u2019t have to \u201ctake it on faith\u201d that the system is fair.",
