    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can independently confirm that rules are applied fairly, mistakes are caught, and concerns are answered without spin. A durable middle ground is to combine (1) verifiable safeguards (paper or otherwise voter-verifiable records, strict chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and public reporting of findings), (2) professional, nonpartisan administration with transparent standards, training, and consequences for misconduct, and (3) an accessible, predictable public experience (reasonable early and Election Day options, secure absentee voting where used, disability access, and clear timelines so slower counts aren\u2019t mistaken for fraud). Just as important, institutions should communicate plainly and proactively\u2014through local officials, libraries, schools, and community groups\u2014in multiple languages, publish data and explanations people can check, and correct misinformation quickly with evidence. When verification, accountability, and inclusion are built into the system and visible to everyday residents, confidence can increase across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in U.S. elections grows when the process is easy to see, easy to verify, and run by trained, nonpartisan professionals who are accountable to the public. We should use verifiable paper ballots (or auditable paper records), secure chain-of-custody, robust cyber protections, and routine independent risk-limiting post\u2011election audits, with the results posted quickly in plain language so any voter can understand what was checked and why the outcome is reliable. At the same time, voting should be practical for working families and people with disabilities through clear, consistently applied rules, well-run polling places, and secure options like early voting and trackable mail ballots where offered. Finally, trusted local officials, schools, libraries, and community organizations should provide nonpartisan, multilingual voter education and rapid, factual responses to misinformation\u2014so confidence comes from evidence and transparency, not partisan claims.",
