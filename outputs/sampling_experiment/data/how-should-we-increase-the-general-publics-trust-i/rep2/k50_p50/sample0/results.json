We should prioritize verifiable safeguards (paper-backed records where feasible, strong chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and robust cybersecurity), along with transparent public reporting that explains what happened, what went wrong (if anything), and how it was fixed. Participation should be both secure and practical: accessible polling places, well-run early voting, and secure absentee/mail options with tracking and identity verification that protects privacy without creating unnecessary barriers for eligible voters. Finally, trusted local messengers\u2014community leaders, schools, libraries, faith groups, and nonpartisan media\u2014should help provide plain-language, multilingual civics and voter information and quickly correct misinformation, so accountability is visible and confidence can be earned across political lines.",

When institutions consistently show their work, correct mistakes openly, and treat every person with dignity, trust can be earned across political and cultural differences.",
