    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and institutions more broadly\u2014grows when rules are clear, outcomes are independently verifiable, and the public can see how decisions are made and corrected. For elections, that means using voter-verified records (such as paper ballots or equivalent auditable backups), routine risk-limiting audits with publicly posted methods and results, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and transparent incident reporting with deadlines for fixes and after-action reviews. Access and integrity should be advanced together: maintain multiple secure ways to vote (in-person, early, and mail where offered), ensure polling places and information are accessible for people with disabilities and in multiple languages, and apply consistent, well-communicated standards across jurisdictions. Finally, institutions should earn trust through calm, nonpartisan communication and accountability\u2014inviting bipartisan observers, protecting voter privacy, enforcing rules evenly, and partnering with trusted local organizations (libraries, schools, civic and faith groups) to provide fact-based education and counter misinformation without political spin.",
