    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in elections, we should focus on practices that are easy to verify, clearly explained, and applied consistently\u2014without making voting unnecessarily hard. That means using voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or paper backups), routine independent post\u2011election audits with publicly posted results, strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity standards, and transparent rules for resolving problems or recounts. Elections should be run by trained professionals with balanced oversight and open observation, along with reliable funding so local offices can meet security and accessibility requirements. Trust also grows when institutions communicate plainly and proactively\u2014sharing clear, multilingual, fact-checked information about how voting works, what safeguards exist, and what happened in each election\u2014while enforcing rules fairly and correcting mistakes publicly when they occur.",
