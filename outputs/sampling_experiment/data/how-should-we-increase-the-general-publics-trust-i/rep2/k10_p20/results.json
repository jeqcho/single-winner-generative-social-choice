    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the evidence checkable, and the leadership accountable, while keeping participation practical for every eligible person. That means using voting systems with a voter-verifiable record (such as paper ballots or paper backups), routine independent audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible), and strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards that are publicly documented. It also means transparent, nonpartisan oversight with meaningful opportunities for observers from multiple parties and community groups, plus timely, plain-language reporting of results, audit findings, and any problems and how they were fixed. Alongside integrity measures like accurate voter rolls and reasonable identity verification options that do not create undue barriers, institutions should invest in consistent funding, staff training, multilingual and disability-accessible services, and ongoing civic education so people can understand the process and verify that it was followed. Trust grows when people can both participate and independently see that the same fair standards were applied to everyone.",

That means using verifiable paper records (or paper-backed systems), maintaining clear chain-of-custody documentation, and conducting routine independent audits such as risk-limiting audits with results published publicly and in plain language. Institutions should communicate consistently and nonpartisanly, including multilingual materials and local outreach, so people know how decisions are made, how errors are detected and corrected, and what protections exist for privacy and ballot secrecy. At the same time, we should keep participation broadly accessible (including accommodations for disability, reasonable voting options, and well-funded local administration) while enforcing the rules fairly and transparently\u2014so everyone can see that the same standards apply to all, misinformation is addressed with verified facts, and accountability is real.",

Trust also grows when institutions communicate in plain language, publish timely public reports (what happened, what safeguards worked, and what was fixed), and provide bilingual information (including Spanish) so families can understand the rules without needing partisan media. Finally, consistent training and adequate funding for local offices, along with transparent community oversight that respects privacy and ballot secrecy, can help people across generations and backgrounds feel that the system is both secure and genuinely accountable to the public.",
