    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, check, and understand how decisions are made\u2014and when rules are applied fairly to everyone. For elections in particular, that means using auditable voting records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), routine post-election audits that are publicly reported, clear chain-of-custody procedures, and independent oversight that includes bipartisan and community observers. Institutions should communicate early and often in plain language\u2014sharing what is known, what is uncertain, and how problems are corrected\u2014while protecting voter privacy and the safety of election workers. At the same time, we should make participation genuinely accessible through reasonable voting options and strong disability and language accommodations. Finally, investing in nonpartisan civic education and transparent, evidence-based responses to misinformation can help people rely less on rumor and more on verifiable facts.",

We should use voter-verifiable paper ballots (or paper-backed records) with routine risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody documentation, and public, plain-language reporting of how ballots are cast, secured, counted, and certified. Election administration should be nonpartisan and locally accountable, with bipartisan and community observers, robust cybersecurity, and adequate funding and protection for election workers. To ensure fairness and broad confidence, voting must remain accessible (including disability accommodations and secure options like early and mail voting where provided), and official information should be timely, multilingual, and easy to understand. Finally, sustained nonpartisan civics education and transparent fact-based communication can reduce misinformation and help people judge outcomes by evidence rather than rumor or partisan claims.",

That means using voter-verifiable paper ballots (or paper-backed records) with routine risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and clear, consistent standards that are applied the same way for everyone.

Finally, institutions should counter misinformation by publishing verifiable facts, showing their work, and correcting errors transparently\u2014because lasting confidence is built through accountability, not slogans.",
