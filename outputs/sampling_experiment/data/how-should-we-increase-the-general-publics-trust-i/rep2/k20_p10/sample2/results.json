We should set clear, consistent standards for voter eligibility verification and ballot handling, use paper-backed systems where feasible, and conduct routine, independent post-election audits with publicly available results that are easy to understand. Access matters too: voting options should be reliable and convenient for working families, people with disabilities, and rural or language-minority communities, with plain-language, multilingual information and responsive help. Finally, institutions should earn trust through transparency and humility\u2014publishing data, correcting mistakes quickly, enforcing rules equally, and partnering with trusted local organizations for strictly nonpartisan education so people can verify how decisions are made and feel respected in the process.",
