    "new_statement": "Trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can independently verify outcomes, understand how decisions are made, and see that rules are applied fairly to everyone. A practical middle ground is to standardize transparent, auditable voting: paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), strong chain-of-custody safeguards, routine risk-limiting audits, and public reporting that clearly explains what was checked and what was found. Oversight should be genuinely bipartisan and include independent experts, with clear conflict-of-interest rules and consequences for misconduct, while protecting voter privacy and system security. At the same time, institutions should invest in plain-language, multilingual, nonpartisan public education through trusted local partners, and provide accessible options for seniors, people with disabilities, and working families. Finally, officials should communicate quickly and honestly about problems and fixes, so the public sees a culture of accountability rather than spin.",
