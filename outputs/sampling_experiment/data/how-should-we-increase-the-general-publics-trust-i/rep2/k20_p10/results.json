We should use voting systems with voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or auditable paper trails), protect a secure chain of custody, and conduct routine, publicly reported post-election audits with independent and bipartisan oversight. At the same time, access must be practical and fair: safe and accessible polling places, reasonable early and mail options where used, disability accommodations, and robust language assistance so eligible voters can participate without confusion or barriers. Institutions should communicate consistently in plain language, publish data and explanations of results and certification steps, and partner with trusted local groups\u2014schools, libraries, faith and community organizations\u2014to provide nonpartisan civic education and counter misinformation without shaming or politicizing. The goal is a system that is secure and accountable, inclusive and understandable, so people across political views can accept outcomes and have confidence that the process is honest.",

We should use paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records, maintain secure chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity, and conduct routine risk-limiting audits with bipartisan and independent oversight, publishing clear, timely results and explanations.

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a simple promise people across backgrounds can agree on: the rules are fair, the process is understandable, and the results are verifiable. That means using paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records, protecting a secure chain of custody, and conducting routine, public risk-limiting audits with independent and bipartisan oversight. Trust also grows when institutions communicate clearly: timely plain-language reports on how votes are counted and certified, what problems occurred (if any), and how they were fixed, shared through schools, community centers, local media, and trusted local organizations. At the same time, access must be real for working people, seniors, and voters with disabilities\u2014through accessible polling places, reasonable early voting and vote-by-mail options, and strong privacy protections. Finally, institutions should counter misinformation with consistent, nonpartisan, evidence-based information in the languages communities use, and commit to ongoing accountability so people feel respected, heard, and confident that outcomes reflect the will of the public.",
