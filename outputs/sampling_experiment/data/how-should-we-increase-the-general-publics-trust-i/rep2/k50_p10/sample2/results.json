That means clear rules applied consistently; transparent procedures from registration to counting; and independent, bipartisan/nonpartisan audits with publicly released, plain\u2011language results. We should strengthen security (including cybersecurity and secure chain\u2011of\u2011custody), maintain auditable records such as paper trails where possible, and fix mistakes quickly and openly. Trust also grows when institutions are accessible and respectful: provide multilingual, easy-to-read explanations; make it straightforward for eligible people to participate; and create local, community-facing ways to ask questions and get timely answers. Finally, institutions should hold themselves accountable by sharing performance data, welcoming oversight, and investing in ongoing civics education and responsible communication so misinformation is addressed with facts, transparency, and dignity for every community.",
