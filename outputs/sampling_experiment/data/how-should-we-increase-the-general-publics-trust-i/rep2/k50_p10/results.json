    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see that rules are fair, decisions are accountable, and outcomes can be independently verified. For elections, that means clear, consistent procedures; strong security and chain-of-custody practices; auditable paper records or equivalent verifiable trails; regular independent audits with publicly reported results; and transparent opportunities for bipartisan and community observation. At the same time, trust requires broad, practical access for eligible voters, stable resources for local officials, and plain-language, multilingual public information that explains what happened and why. Finally, institutions should address mistakes openly, enforce consequences for wrongdoing, and invest in civics and media literacy so disagreements are resolved with evidence rather than rumors.",

Election administration should be nonpartisan and consistent, with clear public explanations of how votes are counted, how results are certified, and what safeguards are in place\u2014along with opportunities for bipartisan observers and public reporting that builds confidence without compromising voter privacy.

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the work of government easy to see, easy to verify, and fair for everyone. That means clear, consistent rules; transparent, nonpartisan administration; and plain-language explanations (in English and Spanish) of what happens at every step, from registration to ballot handling to final certification. We should use systems that create an auditable record (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), require routine independent audits like risk-limiting audits, and allow bipartisan/community observation with strong privacy protections for voters. At the same time, institutions must be accountable: publish performance measures and audit results, correct mistakes quickly, protect voting rights and accessibility for seniors, people with disabilities, and working families, and invest in strong cybersecurity and secure chain-of-custody procedures. Finally, we should strengthen civics and media literacy and provide timely, factual information through trusted local messengers\u2014schools, community groups, and election offices\u2014so people can check claims for themselves and disagree without threats or intimidation. When people can see the rules, verify the results, and be treated with respect, trust can grow across communities.",
