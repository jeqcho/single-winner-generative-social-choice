    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can see\u2014without needing to be experts\u2014that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and results are independently checked. A strong middle-ground approach is to use voting systems with a paper record (or equivalent voter-verifiable backup), conduct routine post-election audits that are public and independently reviewed, and publish clear, plain-language explanations of how ballots are handled, counted, and certified. Administration should be nonpartisan and accountable, with bipartisan and community observers welcomed under consistent, well-enforced standards. At the same time, elections should be accessible and convenient for every eligible voter through well-run polling places, secure mail or early voting where offered, and accommodations for disabilities and language needs. Finally, sustained civics education and rapid, factual responses to misinformation\u2014delivered through trusted local messengers\u2014can reduce confusion and help people evaluate claims using evidence rather than rumors.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make key decisions and outcomes transparent, verifiable, and easy for the public to understand. That means clear, nonpartisan administration; consistent rules; auditable records such as paper ballots or voter\u2011verifiable paper trails; independent, routine risk\u2011limiting audits; strong cybersecurity; and open observation so people can see how the process works from ballot handling through certification. Trust also grows when institutions protect equal access and provide straightforward, multilingual, plain\u2011language information that counters misinformation without partisan spin. By investing in civics and media literacy, responding to questions with evidence, and maintaining accountable oversight, we can rebuild confidence that institutions are fair, secure, and working for everyone.",

At the same time, we should reduce unnecessary barriers for eligible participation\u2014through accessible voting options and multilingual information\u2014while investing in civics education and media literacy so people can better judge claims and resist misinformation. When institutions communicate honestly, invite verification, and treat every person with respect, trust can be rebuilt through proof, not promises.",
