    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014rises when people can see, verify, and understand how decisions are made, and when the rules are applied consistently and fairly. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, evidence-based safeguards (auditable records like paper ballots or voter-verified trails, routine independent post-election audits, clear chain-of-custody, and modern cybersecurity) with transparent public reporting that is easy to interpret. Just as important, institutions should make participation workable for real life by reducing long lines, offering secure options that fit different schedules (such as early voting and trackable mail voting where used), and providing accessible, multilingual information. Oversight should be credibly nonpartisan and locally accountable, with stable funding and professional training so administrators can do their jobs well. Finally, trust grows when institutions communicate early and often, correct errors quickly, and support nonpartisan civic education and responsible information standards without silencing legitimate questions.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in U.S. elections grows when the process is easy to understand, easy to access, and independently verifiable. That means using auditable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), strict chain-of-custody, and routine risk-limiting post-election audits with results reported clearly and publicly in plain language. Elections should be administered by trained, nonpartisan local professionals with transparent oversight and stable funding for staffing, cybersecurity, and secure voter rolls\u2014so rules are followed consistently and mistakes are corrected quickly. At the same time, voting should be practical for working families and people with disabilities through options like early voting, well-run polling places, and secure, trackable mail ballots where allowed. Finally, ongoing nonpartisan civic education and rapid, factual responses to misinformation can help communities see how ballots are counted and why the safeguards work, so more people feel confident their vote is counted fairly.",

We should use auditable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable records), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, routine independent risk-limiting audits, and clear public reporting that explains what was checked and what was found. Trust also depends on accessibility: reliable early voting, secure and trackable vote-by-mail where offered, well-staffed polling places to reduce long lines, and reasonable accommodations for disabilities, work schedules, and transportation needs. Finally, institutions must communicate in plain language\u2014through schools, libraries, community groups, and trusted local officials\u2014in English, Spanish, and other common languages, while openly correcting mistakes, protecting voter privacy, and resisting partisan interference so people across communities can feel confident their voice counts.",
