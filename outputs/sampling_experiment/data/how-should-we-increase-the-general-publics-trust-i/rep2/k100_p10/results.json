We should strengthen transparency with paper-backed, verifiable records where feasible; routine risk-limiting, independently conducted audits; clear public reporting of procedures and results; and secure systems that protect privacy and resist cyber threats. Trust also depends on accessibility and inclusion: reliable options for voters with disabilities and irregular work hours, strong language access (including Spanish and other common community languages), and poll workers and public-facing staff who reflect the communities they serve. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often in plain language through trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, community and faith groups, healthcare providers, and local media\u2014so people learn how the system works, how to observe or verify it, and how mistakes are corrected. By combining verifiable safeguards, nonpartisan administration, consistent enforcement of rules, and respectful, understandable communication, we help people judge evidence over rumor and rebuild confidence over time.",
