    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections increases when the rules are clear, the evidence is checkable, and the people running the process are accountable to the public rather than to a party. A practical middle ground is to use voter-verified records (paper ballots or equivalent), publish strong chain-of-custody documentation, and conduct routine risk-limiting post\u2011election audits with results released quickly in plain language. Oversight should be balanced and independent\u2014welcoming credentialed observers from multiple parties and community groups\u2014while also protecting ballot secrecy, election workers\u2019 safety, and voters\u2019 privacy. At the same time, the system should be easy for eligible citizens to use: accessible polling places, reasonable early voting, secure absentee options with tracking, and consistent, well-communicated standards that reduce confusion across jurisdictions. Finally, sustained trust requires ongoing public education and rapid, factual responses to misinformation, delivered through trusted local institutions like libraries, schools, faith and civic organizations, and local media.",

Election administration should be nonpartisan and locally accountable, with bipartisan observers, clear standards for equipment testing and cybersecurity, and calm, plain\u2011language explanations of how ballots are handled, counted, and certified (including timely corrections when issues arise). At the same time, voting should remain accessible for eligible voters through reliable polling places, reasonable early voting options, and secure absentee or mail voting with strong verification and ballot\u2011tracking where available.

We should strengthen transparency and verification with paper-backed records, strict chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and independent oversight that includes bipartisan and community observers, with audit results and any corrections published promptly in plain language. Security should be treated like risk management: harden systems against cyber and physical threats, protect privacy, and fund trained local staff who can run consistent procedures and communicate calmly when problems occur. At the same time, trust requires access that works for real life\u2014reasonable hours, early and absentee options with trackable status where used, accessible polling places for seniors and people with disabilities, and clear guidance so families and young people can understand what to expect. Finally, institutions should partner with schools, libraries, local media, and community organizations to provide nonpartisan civics education and misinformation-resilient facts, so neighbors can verify evidence for themselves and accept results even when they don\u2019t like the outcome.",
