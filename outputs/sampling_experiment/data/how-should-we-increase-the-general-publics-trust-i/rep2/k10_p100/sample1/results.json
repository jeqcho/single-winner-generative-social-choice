    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can see\u2014step by step\u2014that the rules are fair, the safeguards are real, and the outcome can be independently checked. A practical middle-ground approach is to use verifiable paper records (or voter-verifiable paper trails) everywhere, protect ballots with strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and require routine risk-limiting audits whose methods and results are published promptly in plain language. Keep voting accessible with multiple secure options (in-person, early, and well-verified absentee/mail where allowed), consistent core standards, and accommodations for disabilities, while letting states and localities manage operations transparently. Finally, strengthen public confidence through nonpartisan, multilingual voter education, clear channels to report and resolve problems, and protections for election workers and observers so concerns are addressed calmly, evidence-first, and without partisan pressure.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear, fair rules being followed and can independently verify results. We should standardize common-sense safeguards across jurisdictions: verifiable paper ballots or paper-backed records, strict chain-of-custody documentation, routine risk-limiting post-election audits, strong cybersecurity, and independent, nonpartisan administration with bipartisan and public observation. Just as important, institutions must communicate in plain language (and multiple languages), publish audit findings and any corrections quickly, and make it easy for the public to understand how decisions are made and how problems are investigated and fixed. By pairing visible accountability with broad, practical access to participation\u2014and by investing in civics and media literacy\u2014we can rebuild durable confidence without turning oversight into partisan theater.",
