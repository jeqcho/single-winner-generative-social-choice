Just as important, services must be reliable and equitable\u2014simple access, consistent rules, respectful treatment, and meaningful ways for the public to ask questions, appeal decisions, and participate locally. Finally, institutions and media partners should respond to misinformation with timely corrections, open records where feasible, and calm, factual communication so accountability is visible and trust can be earned over time.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the rules are clear, the process is visible, and results can be independently verified\u2014without making it harder for eligible people to vote. We should standardize core safeguards nationwide: paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), strict chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine risk-limiting audits with publicly posted results. Oversight should be bipartisan and independent, with meaningful public observation and transparent reporting of any problems and how they were resolved. At the same time, voting should remain accessible through reliable polling places, reasonable early voting, secure and trackable absentee/mail options, and full accommodations for voters with disabilities. Finally, trusted local officials, schools, libraries, and community organizations should provide plain-language, multilingual explanations of how registration, counting, auditing, and certification work\u2014so people can see the checks, understand the evidence, and accept outcomes even when their preferred candidate loses.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on practices people can see, verify, and understand, regardless of party or background. That means using paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records) with strict chain-of-custody; conducting routine, independent risk-limiting audits open to bipartisan observers and the public; and publishing timely, plain-language results, audit findings, and explanations of any problems and how they were fixed. Access must be protected alongside security: reliable polling locations, reasonable early voting, secure mail or absentee options with trackable status where used, and full accommodations for voters with disabilities.\n\nTrust also depends on consistent rules and accountable administration. Election offices should be adequately funded to train staff, harden cybersecurity, and respond quickly and calmly to misinformation with factual, well-documented updates. Clear voter education\u2014shared through local officials, schools, libraries, community groups, and in the main languages spoken in the community\u2014should explain how registration, ballot handling, counting, and certification work, and how concerns can be reported and investigated. When institutions show their work, correct errors transparently, and treat every voter with dignity, people are more likely to accept outcomes even when they disagree with the result.",
