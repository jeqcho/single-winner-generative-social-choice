    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability, regardless of who is in charge. We should make key public processes transparent and verifiable by default: use auditable records (such as paper-based backups where feasible), routine independent checks (including risk-limiting audits), strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody controls, and publicly posted performance metrics and incident reports. Access and integrity should be strengthened together by offering secure, convenient options (early and mail voting with tracking where used), removing unnecessary barriers for eligible participants, and ensuring accommodations for disabilities and language needs. Institutions should communicate in plain language, publish data and methods, invite bipartisan and community observers under clear rules, and respond quickly to mistakes with documented fixes rather than defensiveness. Finally, sustained civic education and support for front-line public workers\u2014paired with firm consequences for fraud, corruption, or abuse\u2014can help people across the political spectrum judge outcomes by evidence instead of rumor.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on simple, verifiable rules that people can see working in practice, regardless of party or background. That means using paper ballots (or auditable paper records), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language. Oversight should be genuinely nonpartisan: bipartisan observers, clear conflict-of-interest rules, and public reporting that explains not just outcomes but how concerns are received, investigated, and resolved.\n\nTrust also depends on everyday accessibility and respect. Institutions should provide reliable in-person options, early voting and secure mail voting where used, disability accommodations, and clear instructions that reduce confusion and long lines. Communication should be calm, factual, and delivered through trusted local channels\u2014schools, libraries, local news, community groups\u2014so working people, seniors, and first-time voters can understand the safeguards without needing to be experts. Finally, we should invest in trained staff, protections for frontline workers, and ongoing civic education so the public can verify claims with evidence and feel confident that the same fair rules apply to everyone.",
