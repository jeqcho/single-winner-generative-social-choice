    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that rules are fair, decisions are explainable, and mistakes have real consequences. A practical middle ground is to pair strong transparency with strong accountability: publish clear standards for how decisions are made, release timely public data and plain-language explanations, and invite independent oversight (audits, inspectors general, bipartisan/cross-community review panels, and courts where appropriate) that can verify outcomes and recommend fixes. Institutions should protect privacy and civil liberties while also enforcing consistent rules\u2014addressing fraud, waste, and conflicts of interest with meaningful penalties and open reporting. Finally, trust improves when services work for everyday life: accessible processes, responsive customer service, and ongoing civic/media literacy efforts delivered through trusted local messengers (schools, libraries, community and faith groups). When people can verify the process, understand the rationale, and see problems corrected, confidence can rebuild across ideological lines.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in our elections grows when the process is easy to see, check, and understand\u2014and when it works for every eligible voter. We should use paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper records, maintain strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and conduct routine independent risk-limiting audits with bipartisan observation, publishing clear results and corrections promptly. At the same time, voting should be practical and accessible through reliable polling locations, reasonable early and mail options with tracking where available, and strong accommodations for disabilities and language access. Finally, steady, nonpartisan communication and civics/media-literacy education\u2014delivered through trusted local channels like schools, libraries, and community organizations\u2014can counter misinformation without partisan theater and show, with evidence, that the same rules are applied fairly to everyone.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in our elections, we should focus on a few clear, verifiable safeguards that people from any background can see and understand: use paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records) as the standard, conduct routine independent risk-limiting audits, and maintain strict chain-of-custody with transparent documentation from the moment a ballot is issued to final certification. Election offices should be adequately funded to train and protect poll workers, strengthen cybersecurity, and publish timely results with plain-language explanations of what is known, what is still being counted, and how any problems are corrected. At the same time, rules should be applied consistently and fairly while keeping voting practical for working people, seniors, and voters with disabilities\u2014through reliable polling locations, reasonable early voting, and secure mail options with tracking where available. Finally, trusted local messengers\u2014libraries, community centers, schools, veterans\u2019 and faith groups\u2014can help provide nonpartisan, multilingual voter education so people can verify the process for themselves, resist misinformation, and feel confident that every eligible vote is counted accurately and with dignity.",
