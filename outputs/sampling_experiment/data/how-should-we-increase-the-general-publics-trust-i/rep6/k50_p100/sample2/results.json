    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, verify, and understand how decisions are made, and when rules are applied consistently and fairly. A strong middle-ground approach is to pair broad access to participation (safe in-person, early, and mail options with accommodations for disabilities and language needs) with robust, transparent safeguards (voter-verified paper records or equivalent audit trails, secure chain-of-custody, accurate voter rolls maintained with due process, and routine risk-limiting audits publicly reported). Institutions should communicate in plain language, release timely data and explanations, invite bipartisan and independent observers, and investigate mistakes or misconduct quickly with clear corrective actions. Finally, sustained civic and media literacy education\u2014delivered through schools and trusted local community partners\u2014can reduce misinformation and help people judge claims against evidence.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make key decisions and results easy for everyday people to verify, not just accept. That means clear, consistent rules; nonpartisan administration; secure voting with a reliable paper record or equivalent auditable trail; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine, independent audits whose methods and findings are published in plain language. People should be able to observe appropriate parts of the process, and any irregularities should be investigated promptly and explained transparently.\n\nTrust also depends on fairness and access: convenient options for eligible voters (early, mail, and in-person), well-funded and well-trained staff, and accommodations and multilingual information so no community is left out. Finally, sustained civic and media literacy education\u2014delivered through schools and trusted local organizations\u2014can reduce misinformation and help the public understand how institutions work, how accountability is enforced, and how problems are fixed when they occur.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few standards that people across backgrounds and parties can see and verify: clear rules that don\u2019t change at the last minute, equal access for every eligible voter, and transparent accountability when problems occur. That means secure voting with a verifiable record (such as paper ballots or voter\u2011verified paper trails), strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent, bipartisan post\u2011election audits with results published in plain language. It also means adequate funding and training for local staff, respectful accommodations for voters with disabilities, and multilingual information so communities can participate confidently.\n\nTrust also depends on honest communication: timely reporting of results and audit findings, clear explanations of what happened when irregularities are alleged, and consequences for misconduct\u2014without political spin. Finally, sustained civic and media\u2011literacy education through schools and trusted community institutions can reduce misinformation and help people understand how decisions are made and how to hold institutions accountable. By combining transparency, fairness, and consistent standards with real-world accessibility, institutions can earn trust through evidence and everyday experience.",
