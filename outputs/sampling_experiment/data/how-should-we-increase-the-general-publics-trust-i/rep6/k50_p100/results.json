    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and verify that decisions are made fairly and corrected when they are not. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, common-sense security (accurate voter rolls, secure chain-of-custody, and reliable paper records or equivalent verifiable backups) with equal and convenient access for eligible citizens (well-funded polling places, early and mail options with clear safeguards, and accommodations for disabilities and language needs). Institutions should publish simple, timely explanations of rules, changes, and results; release audit findings and data in usable formats; and invite bipartisan/independent observers and routine audits so verification isn\u2019t limited to one side. Finally, consistent standards, clear consequences for misconduct, and ongoing civics and media-literacy education\u2014delivered through trusted local channels\u2014can reduce misinformation and rebuild confidence that the system works for everyone.",

Rules should be consistent and communicated early, with timely, honest explanations and prompt investigation of problems so rumors don\u2019t fill the gap.
