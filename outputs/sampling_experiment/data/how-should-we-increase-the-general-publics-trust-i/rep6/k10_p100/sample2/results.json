    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014rises when people can see clear evidence that rules are fair, applied consistently, and enforced without partisan influence. We should pair strong integrity safeguards (auditable paper records or equivalent verifiable backups, transparent chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and independent oversight with meaningful public observation) with broad, practical access (well-funded local offices, reasonable options to vote in-person or by mail with clear verification steps, and accommodations for disability and language needs). Institutions should communicate in plain language, publish timely audit findings and corrective actions, and respond quickly to credible concerns while protecting privacy and the peaceful transfer of power. Finally, sustained civics and media-literacy education\u2014delivered through schools and trusted community partners\u2014can reduce misinformation by helping people understand how decisions are made and how accountability works.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in elections and other institutions, we should make decision-making more transparent, verifiable, and clearly explained\u2014so people can see the evidence, not just be asked to believe it. That means maintaining auditable records (such as voter\u2011verified paper ballots or equivalent durable backups), enforcing strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody and strong cybersecurity, and conducting routine, independent risk\u2011limiting audits with results published in plain language. Trust also grows when rules are clear and applied consistently, voter rolls are kept accurate with regular checks, and bipartisan/nonpartisan observers can meaningfully oversee key steps from voting through certification. At the same time, institutions should protect privacy and ensure eligible citizens can participate without unnecessary barriers by offering accessible options (early, mail, and in\u2011person voting; disability and language accommodations) and well\u2011trained, well\u2011resourced local administrators. Finally, proactive civic and media\u2011literacy education and timely, honest communication about problems and fixes\u2014delivered through trusted local channels\u2014help counter misinformation and reinforce accountability.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the rules and the evidence easy for everyday people to see and understand. That means nonpartisan, professional administration; secure and verifiable systems (such as paper ballots or voter-verified records); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; routine independent audits that are publicly reported in plain language; and prompt, transparent investigation and correction of problems. Trust also requires fair and practical access for all eligible citizens, including language support (e.g., Spanish), disability accommodations, and convenient options like early, mail, and in-person voting that are consistently administered.
