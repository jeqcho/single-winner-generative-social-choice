    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and verify how decisions are made and how problems are handled. Institutions should set clear, consistently applied rules; protect privacy and civil rights; and build in independent checks such as transparent reporting, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight, and routine audits that the public can review. They should communicate in plain language, publish timely data and explanations, correct errors openly, and create safe ways for employees and the public to raise concerns without retaliation. Finally, improving access\u2014through practical accommodations, multilingual information, and well-resourced local offices\u2014along with sustained civics and media-literacy education, helps ensure the system is both fair and understandable, reducing space for misinformation and rebuilding confidence over time.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should make decisions and results easy for ordinary people to verify, and we should communicate with clarity, consistency, and humility. That means setting clear rules, publishing plain-language explanations of how decisions are made, opening key processes to independent oversight and public observation, and releasing timely, accessible evidence\u2014such as audits, performance metrics, and corrective-action reports\u2014so people can see what happened and why.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions treat people fairly and respectfully in everyday interactions: services should be accessible (including disability and multilingual access), privacy should be protected, conflicts of interest should be disclosed, and mistakes should be acknowledged quickly with transparent fixes and accountability. Finally, we should invest in civic education and media literacy, partner with trusted local organizations, and respond proactively to misinformation with facts and publicly checkable data. When institutions are transparent, consistently apply rules, and show measurable improvement over time, people across backgrounds and political views have stronger reasons to trust them.",
