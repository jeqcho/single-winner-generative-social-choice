    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, fair enforcement, and evidence that systems work as promised. A practical middle ground is to standardize key election procedures across jurisdictions (while preserving local administration), use voter-verifiable paper records, and require routine post-election checks such as risk-limiting audits, with results published in plain language and open data formats. Access and integrity should be strengthened together: maintain reasonable identity and eligibility verification, protect voter privacy, secure ballot handling and chain-of-custody, and provide multiple safe ways to vote that work for people with different schedules, languages, and abilities. Institutions should also commit to fast, transparent responses to problems\u2014prompt investigations of credible complaints, public explanations of findings, and consequences for misconduct\u2014paired with sustained civic education and regular community briefings so questions are answered before misinformation fills the gap.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in elections, we should focus on simple, visible proof that the rules are fair and the results are correct\u2014no matter who wins. That means using voter\u2011verified paper ballots (or paper records) with strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody, routine risk\u2011limiting post\u2011election audits, and clear, open recount procedures that can be observed by independent and bipartisan monitors. Election offices should publish timely, plain\u2011language explanations of how ballots are cast, secured, counted, and audited, along with transparent reporting of any problems and how they were resolved, while continuously upgrading cybersecurity and protecting voter privacy. At the same time, we should keep voting accessible for all eligible voters through clear, consistent rules, well\u2011trained poll workers, multilingual information, and practical options that work for busy families and working Americans. Finally, sustained civic education and community outreach can reduce misinformation and help people understand the safeguards well enough to verify the process for themselves.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on rules that are clear, applied the same way to everyone, and backed by evidence people can verify for themselves. That means running key decisions through nonpartisan, professional administration; using secure systems with voter\u2011verifiable paper records (or equivalent verifiable backups); protecting data and improving cybersecurity; and conducting routine, publicly reported audits (including risk\u2011limiting audits) with transparent chain\u2011of\u2011custody and meaningful access for independent and bipartisan observers. When problems or anomalies occur, institutions should investigate promptly, publish plain\u2011language findings, and explain what changed and why.\n\nTrust also depends on fairness and access: consistent procedures across jurisdictions where possible, convenient and secure voting options (including language access and accommodations for disability), and safeguards that confirm eligibility without creating unnecessary barriers. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing civic education and media literacy\u2014through schools, community organizations, and trusted local messengers\u2014so people understand how decisions are made, how to check claims, and how accountability works. If institutions reliably show their work, admit mistakes, and measure improvements in public view, trust can be earned across political, age, and cultural differences.",
