    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and the system listens and corrects mistakes. A practical middle ground is to make procedures consistent and transparent across jurisdictions: clear eligibility and voter-list maintenance with due process, secure options to vote (in person, early, and by mail where available) with strong identity and ballot-verification safeguards, and auditable records (paper or voter-verified) backed by routine risk-limiting audits and open chain-of-custody reporting. Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, welcome bipartisan and independent observers, publish timely explanations when problems occur, and enforce real accountability for misconduct without politicizing administration. Pairing this operational transparency with year-round civic education and community outreach can reduce misinformation, increase participation, and rebuild confidence that institutions serve everyone equally.",

That means transparent, nonpartisan administration with clear, consistent rules; secure, verifiable voting using voter\u2011verified paper records (or equivalent auditable backups); routine independent, bipartisan post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits); strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody, cybersecurity, and timely plain\u2011language public reporting when questions arise. Trust also depends on equal access: safe and well\u2011run polling places, reasonable early/in\u2011person and mail options where used, and accommodations for disabilities and language needs. Finally, sustained, nonpartisan civic education and proactive communication\u2014especially in schools and local communities\u2014can counter misinformation and help people understand how ballots are protected and counted, so confidence is earned through openness and accountability rather than rhetoric.",
