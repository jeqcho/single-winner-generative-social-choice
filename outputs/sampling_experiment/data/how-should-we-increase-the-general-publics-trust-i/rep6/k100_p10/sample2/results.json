For elections, that means voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent auditable records, routine risk-limiting audits, strong cybersecurity, and independent, bipartisan oversight with results and audit findings released promptly to the public. Institutions should also communicate clearly in plain, multilingual language about how processes work, how problems are investigated, and what improvements are made\u2014while protecting privacy and applying rules consistently. By pairing verifiable safeguards with accessible participation and honest, nonpartisan public information that counters misinformation, we can build confidence that everyone is treated fairly and that outcomes can be trusted.",

Finally, leaders and communicators should correct errors quickly, share evidence openly, and avoid partisan spin, so trust is earned through transparency, fairness, and performance.",
