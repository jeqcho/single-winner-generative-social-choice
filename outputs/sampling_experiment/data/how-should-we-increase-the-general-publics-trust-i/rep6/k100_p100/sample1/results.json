    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on things people across the spectrum can verify: clear rules set in advance, professional and nonpartisan administration, and transparent evidence that the process worked as intended. That means maintaining reliable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable audit trails), enforcing strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and conducting routine, publicly reported audits and recount procedures that are open to qualified observers from multiple parties and the public. Trust also depends on access and equal treatment, so voting information and assistance should be plain-language, multilingual where needed, and designed to accommodate disabilities and busy work schedules. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often\u2014explaining what happened, admitting mistakes, correcting them quickly, and publishing data and decisions in an understandable way\u2014while supporting long-term civics and media literacy so misinformation has less room to spread.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few principles most people can agree on: make decisions and results transparent, make them verifiable, apply rules consistently, and treat the public with respect.\n\nThat means using voting systems that produce a reliable record (such as paper ballots or voter\u2011verified records), protecting ballots and data with strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity, and conducting routine independent post\u2011election audits that are publicly reported in plain language. The public should be able to observe key steps, and concerns should be investigated promptly with clear explanations of what was found and what was fixed.\n\nTrust also grows when access is fair: secure options for voting in person, early, and by mail where offered; reasonable accommodations for disabilities; and clear multilingual guidance so every eligible voter understands how to participate. Finally, sustained civic and media literacy education\u2014delivered through schools and trusted community organizations\u2014can reduce misinformation and help people judge claims by evidence rather than rumor. When institutions are open, accountable, and consistently fair, confidence can be earned across political differences.",
