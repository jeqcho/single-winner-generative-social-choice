    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, verify, and understand how decisions are made and how problems are handled. A practical middle ground is to pair transparent, consistent procedures with strong protections for both security and access: clear chain-of-custody and up-to-date voter rolls; a verifiable record of each vote (such as paper ballots or an equally auditable record); routine, independent post-election audits that are automatic rather than partisan-triggered; and well-funded, accessible voting options so eligible voters can participate without unreasonable burdens. Just as important, institutions should communicate in plain language, publish timely data and audit results, disclose incidents and fixes promptly, and invest in civics and media literacy so communities can evaluate claims and resist misinformation. When oversight is independent, rules are stable, and accountability is visible, people across the political spectrum have more reason to believe the system is fair\u2014and to accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules and results transparent, verifiable, and easy for everyday people to understand. That means using auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable logs), maintaining strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and conducting routine, independent, nonpartisan post-election audits that publicly confirm the reported totals match the votes cast. Institutions should also keep voter rolls accurate, apply clear and consistent rules without last\u2011minute changes, and promptly disclose and fix any problems. Finally, trust grows when participation is genuinely accessible\u2014well-funded polling places, secure early and mail options, and accommodations for disabilities\u2014paired with plain-language, multilingual public communication and ongoing civic/media literacy outreach to reduce misinformation and help people see the safeguards for themselves.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules and results easy for everyday people to verify, while ensuring everyone can participate. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; clear, consistent procedures that don\u2019t change at the last minute; and public, routine checks such as a paper ballot trail (or other voter-verifiable records), strong chain-of-custody, and automatic risk-limiting audits with results posted in plain language. Access must be real for all communities: well-funded polling places to reduce long lines, secure early and mail options, disability accommodations, and multilingual information. Institutions should communicate early and often, release relevant data without compromising privacy, promptly disclose and fix problems, and invest in civic education and media literacy through schools, community groups, and trusted local messengers. The goal is a system that is secure but not partisan, open to scrutiny, and fair and workable for students, working families, seniors, and new citizens alike.",
