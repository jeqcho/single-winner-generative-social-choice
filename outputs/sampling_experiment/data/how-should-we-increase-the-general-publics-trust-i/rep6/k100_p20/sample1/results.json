    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, check, and understand how decisions are made, and when the same rules are applied fairly to everyone. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, verifiable safeguards (auditable records such as paper trails where feasible, secure chain-of-custody, routine post-process audits with publicly released methods and results, and clear consequences for misconduct) with broad, equal access (reasonable accommodations for disabilities, language access, well-resourced polling and service options, and straightforward procedures that reduce unnecessary confusion or delays). Institutions should communicate in plain language before, during, and after major decisions, publish data and timelines, invite bipartisan/independent observation within privacy limits, and respond quickly and transparently to errors. Investing in local administration, civic education, and media literacy\u2014without partisan messaging\u2014helps communities evaluate claims, reduce misinformation\u2019s impact, and rebuild confidence that outcomes are legitimate even when people disagree with them.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy for everyday people to verify. That means clear, consistent rules; secure, auditable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent verifiable trails); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; routine independent, publicly reported audits; and open, bipartisan/nonpartisan observation. Trust also grows when institutions communicate in plain language, correct mistakes quickly, share data and findings transparently, and keep access fair for all eligible people through accommodations (disability and language access), well-run polling places, and reliable options like early and mail voting. By combining visible accountability with practical accessibility, institutions can demonstrate fairness, reduce misinformation\u2019s impact, and earn confidence over time.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easier for everyday people to verify, and hold leaders accountable when things go wrong. That means clear, consistent rules; transparent processes people can observe and understand; strong security and privacy protections; and independent oversight that publicly reports what it finds. In elections specifically, this includes auditable paper records or equivalent verifiable trails, routine risk-limiting audits, secure chain-of-custody, bipartisan/nonpartisan administration, and prompt, open investigations of problems with clear explanations of what happened and what was fixed. Trust also requires fair access: well-funded local offices and polling places, reasonable wait times, accessible accommodations for disabilities, and language support so all eligible voters can participate confidently. Finally, institutions should communicate in plain language, publish usable data, and invest in nonpartisan civic and media literacy so people can tell the difference between evidence and misinformation\u2014while respecting free speech and the right to participate.",
