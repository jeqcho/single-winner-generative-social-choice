    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections increases when people can both participate easily and verify that the outcome is accurate. A workable middle ground is to set clear, consistent rules; protect ballot access (including disability and language accommodations, early voting, and well-secured mail or drop-off options); and pair that access with strong safeguards such as accurate voter rolls, transparent chain-of-custody, robust cybersecurity, and routine post-election audits that the public can understand. Election administration should be professionally run, insulated from partisan pressure, and open to bipartisan and independent observation, with timely publication of plain-language explanations, audit results, and documented fixes when errors occur. By funding local election offices properly and communicating facts quickly and respectfully\u2014especially when misinformation spreads\u2014we can make elections both secure and broadly trusted.",

We should keep administration nonpartisan, publish plain-language and multilingual explanations of each step (from registration to certification), and make key data and decisions transparent without compromising voter privacy. Every election should use auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verified paper trails), strong chain-of-custody procedures, robust cybersecurity, and routine independent risk-limiting audits whose results are easy for the public to review. Trust also requires equal access: reliable early and absentee options with appropriate safeguards, disability accommodations, and language assistance so every eligible voter can participate with confidence. Finally, officials should communicate quickly and honestly about problems and fixes, enforce accountability for misconduct, and invest in ongoing civic education and media literacy to reduce misinformation and strengthen confidence over time.",

Trust also grows when institutions communicate plainly and quickly: explain what happened, why it happened, how mistakes are fixed, and what protections exist against fraud or interference. Finally, institutions should meet people where they are by investing in multilingual, disability-accessible services, civic education and media literacy, and respectful community partnerships so families, workers, seniors, and new residents can participate confidently and feel their voices are treated with equal dignity.",
