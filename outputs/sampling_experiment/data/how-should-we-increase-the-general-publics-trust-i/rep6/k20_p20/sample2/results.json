Institutions should set clear, measurable standards for performance and ethics; publish plain-language explanations, budgets, and data; and invite regular independent reviews (audits, inspectors general, citizen oversight panels) with public reports and follow-through. They should protect privacy and individual rights while improving access\u2014making services easy to use, offering multiple ways to participate, and providing language and disability accommodations. Trust also grows when institutions communicate quickly and honestly, correct misinformation with evidence, disclose conflicts of interest, and enforce real accountability for failures, alongside ongoing civic education and community partnerships that bring information through trusted local voices.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when the system is secure, transparent, and easy for everyday people to verify without being partisan. That means using auditable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), strict chain-of-custody and secure handling from polling place to storage, and routine, automatic post-election risk-limiting audits conducted by independent, bipartisan teams\u2014with clear public reports that show how results were confirmed and how any issues were fixed. Election offices should communicate in plain language, quickly correct misinformation with evidence, and provide open, lawful observation of key steps while protecting ballot privacy. At the same time, rules should be consistent and not changed at the last minute, voter rolls should be maintained accurately, and voting should remain accessible for all eligible voters through practical options and accommodations (disability and language access, early or mail voting where available). Pairing strong safeguards with clear civic education and respectful, local community outreach can rebuild confidence that every eligible vote is counted accurately and fairly.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the system easy to verify, easy to understand, and fair in practice for every community. That means using verifiable records (like paper ballots or voter-verified paper backups), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine, independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with clear public reports that show what was checked and what was found. Rules should be consistent and announced well in advance, with transparent bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight and meaningful access for observers while protecting privacy. Trust also grows when participation is practical for real lives: accessible polling places, language assistance where needed, accommodations for disabilities, and secure options like early voting and vote-by-mail with tracking. Finally, institutions should communicate in plain language, correct mistakes openly, and partner with trusted local messengers (community groups, veterans\u2019 groups, faith communities, schools, and local media) to improve civic education and reduce misinformation without silencing legitimate questions.",
