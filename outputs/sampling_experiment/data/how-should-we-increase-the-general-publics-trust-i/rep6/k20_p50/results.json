    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is rebuilt when people can see, verify, and influence how decisions are made\u2014and when leaders are held accountable for results. Institutions should make core processes transparent and understandable (plain-language explanations, open data where privacy allows, clear standards, and regular public reporting), and they should invite independent oversight (audits, inspectors general, bipartisan or multi-stakeholder review boards, and protected channels for whistleblowers). Trust also depends on fairness and access: services and civic participation must be reliable, non-discriminatory, and accessible, with consistent rules and timely correction of mistakes. Finally, institutions should communicate early and honestly\u2014acknowledging uncertainty, correcting errors publicly, and partnering with local community groups, schools, and libraries to improve civic and media literacy\u2014so people can distinguish evidence-based information from rumors and feel that their concerns are taken seriously.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules applied consistently, strong safeguards that are independently verified, and honest communication when problems arise. We should make processes transparent and easy to understand: explain in plain language how decisions are made, how votes are cast and counted, and what checks exist to prevent error or tampering. Use verifiable records such as paper ballots or voter-verified backups, maintain strict chain-of-custody, and conduct routine, publicly reported independent audits (including risk-limiting audits) with opportunities for bipartisan and public observation. At the same time, keep participation accessible for all eligible citizens through well-funded local administration, reasonable voting options, disability and language accommodations, and timely, factual reporting of results and any anomalies. Finally, invest in nonpartisan civic and media-literacy education and rapid, evidence-based responses to misinformation so trust is built on observable proof, accountability, and equal treatment rather than partisan claims.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on visible, verifiable accountability that ordinary people can understand and independently check. That means clear, consistent rules; secure records (such as voter\u2011verified paper ballots or equally auditable backups); strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody and strong cybersecurity; routine, nonpartisan audits with publicly posted results; and meaningful opportunities for credentialed observers from multiple parties and communities. Trust also grows when institutions communicate early and plainly\u2014sharing what happened, what safeguards exist, what went wrong if something does, and how it will be fixed\u2014using accessible formats, multiple languages where needed, and accommodations for seniors and people with disabilities. Finally, we should invest in well-staffed local offices, protect frontline workers and whistleblowers, and support ongoing civics and media\u2011literacy education through schools, libraries, workplaces, and community groups, so people can recognize reliable information and feel confident that concerns are handled fairly rather than politically.",
