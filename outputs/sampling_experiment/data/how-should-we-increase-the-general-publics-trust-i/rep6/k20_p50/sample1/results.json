    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, fair treatment, and real accountability in action. A practical middle-ground approach is to set consistent, transparent standards for registration, voting, counting, and certification; use verifiable records (such as voter-verified paper trails where feasible); and conduct routine, independent post-process audits with publicly released methods and results. Institutions should protect access and integrity at the same time by maintaining accurate records, securing systems and chain-of-custody, supporting well-trained frontline staff, and providing reasonable identity and eligibility checks that include workable accommodations so eligible people are not blocked. Finally, trust increases when leaders communicate early and often in plain language\u2014through multilingual, community-based channels\u2014promptly acknowledge mistakes, explain how they are fixed, and enforce consequences for misconduct, so the public can judge performance by evidence rather than partisan claims.",

Elections should be accessible to every eligible voter through well-run in\u2011person, early, and mail options with reasonable safeguards, along with accommodations for disabilities and language access where needed.

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy for everyday people to verify, and ensure the system treats everyone fairly and respectfully. That means clear, consistently applied rules; secure, auditable records (such as voter-verified paper ballots or equivalent verifiable records); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine independent, bipartisan audits with results published promptly in plain language. Trust also depends on access: well-funded local offices, well-trained staff, convenient and secure voting options, and accommodations for disability and language needs so every eligible citizen can participate without undue barriers. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often through trusted community channels (schools, libraries, workplaces, and local groups), correct misinformation with evidence, and be transparent about mistakes and fixes\u2014because accountability, not slogans, is what earns confidence over time.",
