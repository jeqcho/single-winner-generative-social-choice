    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can independently see that decisions are made fairly, rules are followed consistently, and mistakes are acknowledged and corrected. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, verifiable safeguards (e.g., secure recordkeeping such as paper or voter-verifiable audit trails, routine risk-limiting audits, strict chain-of-custody, and independent oversight with public observation where appropriate) with broad, lawful access (reasonable accommodations for disabilities, language access, and convenient options like early or mail voting with clear security procedures). Institutions should publish plain-language explanations, open data where privacy allows, and timely reports on audits, incidents, and fixes\u2014while protecting personal information and ensuring nonpartisan administration. Finally, sustained civic and media-literacy education delivered through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, community groups) can reduce misinformation and help people judge evidence for themselves.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the process observable, and the results independently verifiable. That means using voter\u2011verifiable paper ballots (or an equivalent auditable record), strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine risk\u2011limiting post\u2011election audits with bipartisan/independent oversight. Institutions should publish timely, plain\u2011language explanations of procedures, audit findings, and any errors and corrective actions, so the public can see how concerns are handled without partisan spin. Trust also depends on fair access: well\u2011resourced local offices, safe and well\u2011staffed polling places, and practical options like early, mail, and in\u2011person voting with consistent safeguards, plus multilingual and disability\u2011accessible information. Finally, sustained nonpartisan civic education and media\u2011literacy outreach\u2014delivered through schools and trusted community groups\u2014can reduce misinformation and help people understand how verification works in practice.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should focus on a few principles most people can verify for themselves: clear rules, transparent processes, real accountability, and fair access. That means using voting systems with a voter\u2011verified paper record, strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine, independent post\u2011election audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits) with results published in plain language. It also means keeping administration nonpartisan, funding local offices so polling places are well staffed and well run, and ensuring practical access for working people, seniors, people with disabilities, rural voters, and language communities through reasonable early, mail, and in\u2011person options with consistent safeguards. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often through trusted local messengers\u2014schools, libraries, community groups, and faith organizations\u2014so people can understand how decisions are made, how problems are investigated, and what evidence supports the outcome. When people can see how the system works, confirm results through objective checks, and know that mistakes are admitted and fixed, trust can grow across political and cultural lines.",
