We should pair broad access for eligible voters with strong integrity safeguards: secure ballot handling, up-to-date voter rolls, voter-verified paper records (or equivalent auditable backups), routine risk-limiting audits, and transparent chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards. Oversight should be independent and balanced, with clear avenues for observers, whistleblowers, and courts to review credible concerns without partisan interference. Just as important, officials must communicate early and often in plain language\u2014publishing data, explaining changes before Election Day, and correcting misinformation with evidence\u2014while investing in civic education and accessibility (language support, disability accommodations, and well-resourced polling places) so every community can participate confidently and see that results are earned, not asserted.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in U.S. elections grows when people can see\u2014clearly and consistently\u2014that the system is fair, secure, and open to eligible voters. We should use auditable paper ballots (or voter\u2011verified paper records), protect the chain of custody, and run routine risk\u2011limiting post\u2011election audits with bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight so results are independently verifiable. Election offices also need strong cybersecurity, adequate staffing and funding, and timely, plain\u2011language public reporting that explains rules, procedures, and any issues or anomalies without spin. At the same time, we should keep voting accessible through well-run polling places and reasonable options like early voting and secure mail voting, with disability accommodations and multilingual support. By pairing rigorous verification with transparent communication and consistent standards, we can reduce misinformation, protect civil liberties, and strengthen confidence that every eligible vote is counted accurately.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on standards people can see, check, and rely on. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; secure, auditable processes (including paper records where feasible), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine independent risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language. Rules should be clear, consistent, and not changed at the last minute, with timely explanations when problems occur and real accountability when they do. At the same time, trust requires broad, practical access: well-funded polling places to reduce long lines, reasonable early and mail options, and accommodations for seniors, people with disabilities, and language needs so every eligible voter can participate confidently. Finally, ongoing civic education and community outreach\u2014through schools, local organizations, and trusted civic groups\u2014can help people understand how decisions are made, how to verify information, and why safeguards protect both ballot security and civil liberties.",
