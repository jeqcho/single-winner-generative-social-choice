    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections rises when people can see, verify, and understand that the rules are fair and applied consistently. A durable middle ground is to pair strong security with equal access: use voter-verified paper records (or equivalent auditable trails), routine risk-limiting audits with public results, clear chain-of-custody, and transparent, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight that allows credentialed observers and the public to follow the process without compromising ballot secrecy. Keep changes to procedures predictable and well announced, publish plain-language and multilingual explanations of how voting and counting work, and rapidly investigate and report any problems and corrections. Finally, invest in year-round civic education and local community outreach\u2014through schools, libraries, veterans and faith groups, and civic organizations\u2014so misinformation is addressed with evidence and citizens feel respected, included, and confident their vote counts.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in US elections, we should focus on processes people can see, understand, and verify\u2014without advantaging any party. That means using verifiable ballot records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine, independent post\u2011election audits (including risk\u2011limiting audits) with results reported publicly in plain language. Election rules should be clear, consistent, and communicated early, with timely disclosure and investigation of any irregularities. Oversight should be nonpartisan and transparent, with meaningful public observation and accountability for mistakes or misconduct. At the same time, voting must remain accessible to all eligible voters through well\u2011resourced polling places and practical accommodations for disabilities and language needs, alongside ongoing nonpartisan civics and voter education and proactive efforts to counter misinformation so people know how results are produced and why they can be trusted.",
