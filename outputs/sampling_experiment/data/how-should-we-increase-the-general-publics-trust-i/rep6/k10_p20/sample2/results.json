    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see that rules are fair, decisions are explainable, and mistakes are corrected in the open. We should strengthen transparency with clear, plain-language reporting on how ballots are issued, secured, counted, and certified; require routine independent audits with publicly available results; and enforce strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards while protecting voter privacy. At the same time, institutions should make participation practical for all eligible voters through reliable, accessible options (in-person and absentee), consistent training and resources for frontline staff, and straightforward, consistently applied rules. Finally, leaders and agencies should communicate early and often through trusted local messengers, publish data and timetables, and respond quickly to misinformation with verifiable facts\u2014so confidence is built on evidence, not politics.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on transparency people can see, rules people can understand, and accountability that is independent and verifiable. That means nonpartisan administration; secure, auditable systems with voter-verifiable paper records where feasible; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine, publicly reported post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with clear explanations of what was checked and what was found. Trust also depends on fair, consistent standards, timely and plain-language communication, and real consequences for misconduct or errors. At the same time, institutions should make participation practical and inclusive through accessible polling places, accommodations for disabilities, multilingual support, and convenient options like early or mail voting with appropriate safeguards. Finally, sustained civic education and locally trusted, nonpartisan community outreach can help counter misinformation and ensure people know how the process works, how to verify information, and why their voice is protected and respected.",

Institutions should invest in secure, reliable systems, publish performance measures (wait times, outcomes, budgets, error rates), and correct mistakes quickly with visible accountability.\n\nTrust also grows when access is real for everyone: services and information should be available in multiple languages, accessible for people with disabilities, and designed for working families and older adults\u2014not just those with time and expertise. Finally, institutions should partner with trusted local messengers\u2014schools, community organizations, faith groups, libraries, and frontline staff\u2014to provide practical civic education and counter misinformation with timely, evidence-based communication. When people can see how decisions are made, verify the safeguards, and feel respected, confidence increases across communities.",
