    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions is rebuilt when people can see clear standards, real accountability, and equal treatment\u2014without requiring blind faith. Institutions should publish understandable goals, budgets, and performance measures; make key decisions and data auditable by independent inspectors; and respond quickly and publicly when mistakes or misconduct occur, including concrete corrective actions and consequences. Services must be delivered fairly and reliably across communities, with simple access routes, language and disability accommodations, and frontline staff trained to treat the public with respect. Institutions should also invite meaningful public oversight\u2014open meetings where appropriate, protected whistleblowing channels, citizen advisory boards, and regular third-party reviews\u2014while protecting privacy and security. Finally, leaders and communicators should stick to verified facts, clearly distinguish evidence from opinion, and correct misinformation consistently. Over time, transparency plus competence plus consequences is what turns skepticism into durable trust.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on measures people can verify for themselves: clear, consistent rules; transparent, nonpartisan administration; and results that can be independently checked. That means using auditable paper ballots or voter-verified records, maintaining strict chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity, and conducting routine, public risk-limiting audits with bipartisan/independent observers. When concerns arise, officials should investigate promptly and publish plain-language explanations and data that protect voter privacy while showing the evidence behind outcomes. Trust also grows when participation is accessible and fair\u2014through well-run polling places, secure early and mail options where used, disability and language accommodations, and community-based, nonpartisan voter education that counters misinformation with facts and respect.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially in elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared, practical standards that people across viewpoints can see and verify. First, institutions should make outcomes provable: use voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or reliable paper trails), protect chain-of-custody, and run routine, independent risk-limiting audits with public reporting of methods and results. Second, rules should be clear, consistent, and applied equally, with timely explanations when procedures change and prompt, credible investigation of errors or irregularities. Third, access and security should be strengthened together: keep voting convenient for eligible voters (reasonable hours, early/mail options with safeguards, disability and language access) while maintaining accurate voter rolls, strong cybersecurity, and transparent oversight that includes bipartisan and nonpartisan observers. Finally, institutions must communicate in plain language\u2014multilingual where needed\u2014through trusted local channels (schools, libraries, community and faith organizations), publish easy-to-check data, and address misinformation with calm, evidence-based updates. Trust grows when people can participate, understand the process, and independently confirm that results match the votes cast.",
