    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and verify that rules are fair, consistent, and applied the same way to everyone. A practical middle path is to pair strong integrity safeguards (voter-verified paper records or equivalent audit trails, secure chain-of-custody, clean voter rolls with due-process protections, and routine independent risk-limiting audits) with broad access (well-funded polling places, secure early/mail/in-person options, disability accommodations, and multilingual, plain-language materials). Institutions should publish clear, timely explanations of decisions and results, release audit findings and corrective actions, invite bipartisan and community observers, and respond quickly to credible concerns with evidence rather than rhetoric. Finally, long-term trust requires sustained civics and media-literacy education and consistent accountability for misconduct or mistakes\u2014so people feel both protected and heard, regardless of party or background.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make decision-making and outcomes transparent, verifiable, and understandable to everyday people, while protecting equal access and the rule of law. That means using voting systems with voter-verifiable paper records (or equivalent durable audit trails), strict chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine independent risk-limiting audits with public, plain-language reporting of what was checked and what was found. Administration should be clearly nonpartisan with bipartisan/independent oversight and consistent, predictable rules that are communicated early and applied fairly across jurisdictions.\n\nTrust also depends on participation and information: provide accessible in-person, early, and mail options with well-trained staff; publish clear multilingual guidance on how ballots are cast, counted, and certified; and respond quickly and credibly to problems to prevent rumors from filling the gap. Finally, invest in civics and media literacy and proactive community outreach so people can evaluate claims, see evidence for themselves, and feel confident that every eligible voter can participate and every lawful vote is counted accurately.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easier for everyday people to verify, not just accept. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; clear and consistent rules; and strong, common-sense safeguards that protect both access and integrity. Concretely: use voter-verifiable records (paper ballots where feasible or robust audit trails), maintain secure chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and require routine, independent post-election audits (with bipartisan and public-facing observation) that publish plain-language findings and corrective actions when problems occur. Trust also depends on equal treatment and inclusion: accessible voting options for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and language communities; well-trained, well-funded local offices; and clear multilingual communication about how to participate and how counts are certified. Finally, institutions should invest in civics and media literacy and respond quickly and factually to misinformation, so people can judge claims against evidence and see that accountability\u2014not partisan spin\u2014guides the process.",
