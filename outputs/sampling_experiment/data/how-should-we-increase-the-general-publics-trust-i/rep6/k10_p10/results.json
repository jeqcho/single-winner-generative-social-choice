    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and independently verify that the rules are fair and applied consistently. A practical middle ground is to pair strong security with broad access: voter-verified paper records (or equivalent auditable trails), routine risk-limiting audits run by independent professionals with bipartisan oversight, and clear public reporting that explains results and any problems in plain language and multiple languages. Institutions should also publish performance metrics, protect whistleblowers, and respond quickly and transparently to errors or allegations, including corrective actions and timelines. Finally, investing in civic education, customer-service-style voter support, and consistent standards across jurisdictions helps people of different backgrounds feel respected and confident that every eligible person can participate and every valid vote is counted accurately.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on processes people can understand, verify, and rely on regardless of party. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; secure, auditable systems such as voter-verified paper ballots (or equivalent verifiable records); and routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits) with results and methods published in plain language. Trust also grows when participation is both secure and accessible: well-resourced polling places, reliable in-person and mail options where used, strong ballot-privacy protections, and practical accommodations for disabilities and long work hours. Finally, institutions should communicate clearly and consistently in multiple languages, respond quickly and honestly to concerns, protect whistleblowers, strengthen cybersecurity, and counter misinformation with timely, factual public information\u2014so the public can see not just that rules exist, but that they are followed and enforced fairly.",

That means clear, plain-language (and multilingual) explanations of rules and outcomes; transparent reporting that shows how inputs become decisions; and strong, independent oversight with publicly released audits and follow-up on problems. Institutions should protect privacy and civil rights, invest in secure systems and cybersecurity, and create safe ways for employees and the public to report concerns without retaliation. Just as important, participation must be practical: accessible in-person and remote options, disability accommodations, and well-resourced frontline staff who treat people with respect. Trust grows when institutions consistently tell the truth, correct errors quickly, and demonstrate\u2014through evidence, not slogans\u2014that they serve the common good.",
