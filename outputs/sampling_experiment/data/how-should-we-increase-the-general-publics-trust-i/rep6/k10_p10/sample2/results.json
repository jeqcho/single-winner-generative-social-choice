    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and verify that rules are fair and applied consistently. We should pair strong, auditable safeguards (such as voter-verifiable records, routine independent audits, secure chain-of-custody practices, and clear standards for equipment and certification) with genuine accessibility (disability accommodations, multilingual materials, and multiple secure ways to vote). Just as important, institutions must communicate in plain language, publish timely data and audit results, invite bipartisan and community observation, and respond to problems transparently with real accountability. Investing in local civic education and trusted community partnerships can reduce misinformation and help people engage respectfully, so confidence is earned through demonstrated competence, openness, and equal treatment.",

Trust also grows when institutions communicate clearly and nonpartisanly: plain-language, multilingual explanations of what safeguards exist, how results are produced, and how concerns are investigated and resolved, with public observation and reporting where appropriate.
