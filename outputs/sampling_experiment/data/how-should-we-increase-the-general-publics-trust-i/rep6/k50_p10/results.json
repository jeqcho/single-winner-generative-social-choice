    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can both participate easily and verify that the process is secure, fair, and consistently administered. We should use voter-verified paper records as the baseline, conduct routine risk-limiting audits with publicly posted results, and enforce strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards under independent, nonpartisan election administration. Eligibility checks should be reliable and uniform, with practical identity verification options that don\u2019t disenfranchise eligible voters, alongside accessible voting (early/in-person options, reasonable mail voting, disability and language accommodations). Finally, officials should communicate in plain language\u2014before, during, and after elections\u2014sharing clear rules, open data where feasible, and rapid corrections to misinformation through trusted local partners so communities can see how outcomes are reached and have a clear path to raise concerns.",

We should use voter\u2011verified paper ballots (or paper backups), routine independent risk\u2011limiting audits, strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity, and nonpartisan, locally accountable administration with bipartisan observation. Officials should publish plain\u2011language explanations and timely public reports\u2014showing how ballots are handled, counted, and audited, and how concerns are resolved\u2014so people can see safeguards working rather than relying on partisan claims. At the same time, we should keep voting accessible through well-run early and mail options where allowed, disability accommodations, and clear language access, paired with community-based civic education and rapid, factual responses to misinformation. The goal is a process that is both hard to tamper with and straightforward to trust.",

Institutions should be run with nonpartisan, accountable oversight (including balanced local observers and clear ethics rules), and they should communicate early and often through trusted community channels\u2014schools, workplaces, faith groups, libraries, and local media\u2014so people get timely, factual information rather than rumors. At the same time, we should protect access for all eligible voters with practical accommodations (disability support, language access, and options that work for working families), while enforcing consistent rules that prevent errors and deter fraud. When institutions are transparent, consistently applied, independently checked, and accessible, trust can be earned across political, cultural, and generational lines.",
