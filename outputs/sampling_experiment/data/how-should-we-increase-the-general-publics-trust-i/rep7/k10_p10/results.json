We should pair strong security with transparency: paper records where feasible, routine independent audits with publicly available results, and clear chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards. At the same time, institutions should make participation and oversight easy by providing plain-language, multilingual explanations, open observation and question-and-answer opportunities, and well-trained frontline staff who treat everyone with respect. Finally, leaders and media partners should commit to correcting false claims quickly with evidence, while investing in ongoing civic education and trusted local messengers so communities understand both their rights and the safeguards in place.",

That means using auditable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable paper records), strong chain-of-custody procedures, and routine independent risk-limiting audits with publicly posted, plain-language results so anyone can see how outcomes were confirmed. Administration should be nonpartisan and accountable, with well-trained poll workers, clear lines for questions and observation, and strong cybersecurity protections. At the same time, trust requires fair access: reliable options for in-person, early, and secure mail voting (including tracking where appropriate), language and disability accommodations, and outreach through trusted local community partners. Finally, sustained nonpartisan civic education and rapid, evidence-based responses to misinformation can help people understand the safeguards and feel confident that every eligible vote is counted accurately.",

That means using verifiable paper records, strong cybersecurity, and routine independent risk-limiting audits with clear chain-of-custody rules, then publishing plain-language, multilingual explanations of what was done and why. Oversight should be visibly nonpartisan and locally accessible: well-trained staff, open observation and question periods, and timely, consistent reporting so communities can see accountability in action.
