    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see that decisions are made fairly, competently, and with real accountability. A practical middle ground is to strengthen transparency and verification without favoring any party: clear rules applied consistently, secure systems with auditable records (such as paper backups where appropriate), routine independent reviews, and public reporting that is timely, plain-language, and accessible in multiple languages and formats. Trust also improves when institutions admit mistakes, explain how they are corrected, protect frontline workers from intimidation, and invite structured public observation and feedback. Finally, long-term confidence requires broad civic education and responsible communication that addresses misinformation with verifiable facts, while keeping participation accessible and lawful for every eligible person.",
