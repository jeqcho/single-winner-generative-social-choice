    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on transparency people can verify, fairness people can experience, and accountability people can see. That means clear, consistent rules; secure, auditable records (such as paper trails or comparable verifiable backups); routine independent post-process audits; and public reporting in plain language, multiple languages, and accessible formats. Institutions should make it easy for community members and accredited observers from across the political spectrum to understand procedures and raise concerns, while protecting frontline workers and enforcing consequences for misconduct. Finally, sustained civics and media-literacy education, paired with prompt, honest communication when mistakes happen and how they are corrected, can reduce misinformation and help people judge outcomes by evidence rather than rumor.",

That means clear, plain-language explanations of how decisions are made and how votes are collected and counted; strong security and chain-of-custody; verifiable paper ballots or auditable paper records; and routine independent, bipartisan post-election audits with publicly available results. Institutions should communicate early and often, acknowledge mistakes honestly, fix problems quickly, and invite lawful public observation so people can see the safeguards in action. We should also strengthen nonpartisan civics education and media literacy, provide accessible participation options for all eligible voters (including multilingual materials), and protect frontline workers from harassment. When transparency, accountability, and broad access are built into the system\u2014and shown clearly to the public\u2014trust can grow even among people who disagree on politics.",

That means clear standards that are applied consistently, strong security and chain-of-custody, and a voter-verifiable paper record (or equally auditable record) backed by routine independent, bipartisan audits. Institutions should publish plain-language, step-by-step explanations of how decisions are made and how results are checked, using simple visuals and translations so families, older adults, and non\u2011English-speaking households can follow along. Access also matters: services and voting should be convenient and safe (including options like early voting, mail voting where appropriate, and well-run in-person sites), with well-trained staff and protection from harassment. When mistakes happen, institutions should acknowledge them quickly, show the evidence of what changed, and explain how they will prevent repeats\u2014while investing in civics and media literacy so people can spot misinformation and engage respectfully, even when they disagree with the outcome.",
