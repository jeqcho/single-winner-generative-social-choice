    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can both participate easily and verify that rules are followed the same way for everyone. A practical middle ground is to set clear, public minimum standards for security and access (without erasing local control): voter eligibility checks that don\u2019t become unfair barriers, paper-based or otherwise voter-verifiable records, strict chain-of-custody, and routine independent audits with results published in plain language. Institutions should also communicate early and often\u2014sharing what happened, what went wrong, and how it was fixed\u2014while protecting privacy and election workers. Finally, sustained, nonpartisan public education and multilingual outreach through trusted local messengers (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups) can reduce misinformation and help communities see the system working, even when they dislike the outcome.",

That means paper-based or otherwise voter-verifiable records, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and routine independent, bipartisan post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with clear, plain-language public reports of what was checked and what was found. Institutions should pair these safeguards with consistent minimum standards, local accountability, and respectful communication in multiple languages through trusted community messengers (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups), while strengthening civics and media literacy to reduce misinformation. When problems occur, they should be disclosed promptly, corrected transparently, and followed by real accountability\u2014so people can trust the outcome even when their side loses.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the work verifiable, and the service reliable for everyone. That means using auditable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent verifiable backups), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine independent post-election audits with results published in plain language. Institutions should be run by trained, accountable officials with bipartisan and community observation, consistent minimum standards across jurisdictions, and real consequences for mistakes or misconduct\u2014paired with quick, transparent fixes when problems occur. Trust also grows when people can actually participate without unnecessary barriers, so voting and public services should be accessible to seniors and people with disabilities, and essential information should be easy to find, multilingual where needed, and shared through trusted local channels like schools, libraries, and community groups. Finally, ongoing civics education and media literacy\u2014especially for kids and families\u2014helps people understand how decisions are made, how money is spent, and how outcomes are checked, reducing misinformation and strengthening confidence even when we disagree on politics.",
