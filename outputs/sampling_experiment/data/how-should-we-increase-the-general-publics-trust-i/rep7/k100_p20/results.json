    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can verify the process for themselves and also find it easy and fair to participate. A practical middle-ground approach is to standardize core safeguards nationwide\u2014clear chain-of-custody, transparent tabulation procedures, and routine post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) using voter-verifiable paper records\u2014while preserving local flexibility in how voting is offered. Access should be broad and secure: reliable in-person voting, well-run early voting, and mail voting with strong identity and eligibility checks that do not create unnecessary barriers, plus accommodations for voters with disabilities and clear options for language access. Election offices should publish plain-language, nonpartisan explanations of how results are produced, release audit findings quickly (including how errors were corrected), invite bipartisan and community observers, and protect poll workers from intimidation. Consistent transparency, accountability, and respectful public communication\u2014before, during, and after Election Day\u2014are the most durable way to rebuild confidence, even among people who disagree about politics.",

That means using verifiable paper ballots (or auditable paper records), strong chain-of-custody rules, and routine independent audits such as risk-limiting audits, with results published promptly in plain language. Elections should be administered by trained, nonpartisan professionals with bipartisan/independent observation and clear accountability when mistakes happen\u2014acknowledge problems, fix them, and explain what changed. At the same time, voting should remain accessible for every eligible citizen through well-run polling sites and practical options like early voting and safe mail voting, with clear, multilingual voter information shared through trusted community places like schools, libraries, and faith or civic groups. Transparent safeguards, open reporting, and respectful public education are the most reliable way to reduce misinformation and help people across viewpoints feel confident that every valid vote is counted fairly.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on three shared commitments: transparency people can see, rules people can count on, and access people can use. That means secure systems with a clear paper trail (or equally verifiable records), strong chain-of-custody, regular independent audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with results published promptly, and clear accountability when errors occur. It also means consistent, nonpartisan administration with bipartisan/independent oversight and strong protections for frontline workers so the process can be observed without intimidation. Trust grows when information is understandable and local: provide plain-language, multilingual explanations (including Spanish and other common community languages) through schools, libraries, faith groups, and community centers, using simple visuals and step-by-step guides so families, seniors, and first-time voters understand how ballots are cast, counted, and checked. Finally, expand practical voting access\u2014reasonable early voting, safe absentee/mail options with safeguards, accessible polling places, and well-trained poll workers\u2014so every eligible voter can participate confidently while maintaining strong integrity protections. When institutions are open about how decisions are made, prove their work with independent verification, and communicate clearly and respectfully, more people can accept outcomes even when they disagree with them.",
