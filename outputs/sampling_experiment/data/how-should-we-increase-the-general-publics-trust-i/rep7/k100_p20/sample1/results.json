    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can both understand the rules and independently verify that they\u2019re followed. A practical middle ground is to pair broad, lawful access to participation with strong, evidence-based safeguards: clear eligibility checks, secure systems with a voter-verifiable record (such as paper ballots or equivalent), routine independent audits with publicly released results, and transparent opportunities for bipartisan/community observation. Institutions should communicate in plain, nonpartisan language across multiple formats and languages, promptly acknowledge and correct errors, and use trusted local partners (schools, libraries, community groups) to answer questions and counter misinformation with facts. When the process is open, accountable, and consistently applied, more people\u2014across communities and political views\u2014can feel confident their voice counts.",

That means clear, consistent rules; secure systems with a verifiable record (such as paper ballots or equivalent) and routine independent audits whose methods and findings are published in plain language. Administration should be nonpartisan and accountable, with opportunities for bipartisan/community observers, prompt correction of errors, and transparent reporting that shows how the numbers add up. Trust also depends on fair access and inclusion: information should be available in multiple languages and accessible formats, with strong civics education and rapid, evidence-based responses to misinformation so every community can understand the process and see that it is applied fairly.",
