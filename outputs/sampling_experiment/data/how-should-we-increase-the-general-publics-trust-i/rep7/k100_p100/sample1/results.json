    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can clearly see how decisions are made, how rules are enforced, and how mistakes are caught and corrected. We should set transparent, consistent standards; keep verifiable records (such as paper trails where applicable); and require routine, independent audits with results published in plain language. Institutions should make participation and services accessible (including disability and language access), protect privacy, and create regular opportunities for public observation and feedback without politicizing day-to-day administration. Finally, leaders and officials should communicate calmly and honestly, correct misinformation with evidence, and be held accountable through clear ethics rules and consequences\u2014so trust is earned through performance, not promises.",

Just as important, institutions should explain how the process works in plain language, publish timely public reports of results and audit findings (including what went wrong and how it was fixed), and provide accessible information in multiple languages and formats. By combining verifiable security, equal access for eligible voters, and honest, steady communication\u2014while countering deliberate misinformation with evidence\u2014we can help people see that rules are followed, problems are addressed, and outcomes are credible even when their side loses.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decision-making and results easy for ordinary people to verify, while ensuring fair access and equal treatment. That means clear, consistent rules; secure processes with verifiable records (such as paper trails where feasible); routine independent audits with publicly posted, plain-language findings; and strong protections for privacy and data security. Institutions should communicate early and often in straightforward, multilingual formats (including Spanish and other common community languages), publish what went wrong when problems occur, and show how issues are fixed with timelines and accountability. Trust also grows when the public can see the work up close: open houses, observation opportunities, community briefings at schools, libraries, and faith/community centers, and trained frontline staff who treat everyone with respect\u2014especially seniors, people with disabilities, immigrants, and busy working families. Finally, institutions should counter misinformation with transparent evidence, nonpartisan education, and consistent enforcement of rules, so people can disagree about outcomes without doubting the integrity of the system.",
