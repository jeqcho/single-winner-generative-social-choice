    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are followed, and experience fair treatment in everyday interactions. Institutions should publish clear, plain-language explanations of policies and results; open key processes to independent audits and public observation where appropriate; enforce strong ethics and conflict-of-interest rules; and acknowledge mistakes quickly with transparent fixes and accountability. At the same time, services and information must be accessible\u2014across languages, disabilities, and income levels\u2014and delivered consistently so everyone feels included rather than ignored. Finally, institutions should partner with trusted local messengers (schools, libraries, community and faith groups) to provide nonpartisan education, listen to concerns, and counter misinformation with evidence and respect, so trust is earned through openness, competence, and equal dignity.",

That means clear, consistent rules; secure processes with a reliable paper or auditable record; routine independent audits with publicly posted findings; and strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections. Institutions should explain what they are doing in plain language, with multilingual and disability-accessible materials, publish data and timelines proactively, and quickly acknowledge and fix mistakes. Trust also grows when oversight is genuinely nonpartisan, community members can observe and ask questions locally, workers and officials are protected from threats, and schools and community organizations provide practical civics and media-literacy education that counters misinformation without partisan spin.",
