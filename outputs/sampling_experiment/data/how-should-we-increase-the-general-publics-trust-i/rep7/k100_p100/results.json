    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see clear standards, consistent service, and real accountability in action. We should make core processes transparent and independently verifiable (e.g., auditable records, routine public audits, and clear chain-of-custody and cybersecurity practices), while keeping participation and services accessible through plain-language, multilingual information and practical accommodations for disabilities, work schedules, and geography. Institutions should communicate early and often with fact-based updates, openly acknowledge errors, explain how they are corrected, and invite structured public observation and feedback through community partners like schools, libraries, and faith and civic groups. By pairing strong safeguards with respectful communication and visible follow-through, we can reduce rumors, deter abuse, and rebuild confidence across political and cultural lines.",

That means clear, plain-language explanations of the rules and the full process (how to register, vote, count, and report), consistent minimum standards across jurisdictions, and strong security with a verifiable paper trail, strict chain-of-custody, and routine independent audits whose results are published promptly. Oversight should be nonpartisan and transparent, with opportunities for bipartisan observers and public \u201copen house\u201d style engagement so communities can witness safeguards firsthand. Institutions should communicate calmly and honestly about problems, correct errors quickly, protect workers and participants from intimidation, and counter misinformation with accessible facts in multiple languages and formats. Finally, institutions must keep participation practical and inclusive\u2014safe, accessible locations and options for seniors, people with disabilities, and working families\u2014so integrity and equal access reinforce each other.",

Second, trust must be earned through proof, not promises: routine independent audits (including risk-limiting audits where appropriate), bipartisan or multi-stakeholder oversight, transparent testing, and public reporting that clearly shows what was checked, what was found, and how any issues were corrected. Third, institutions should explain processes in plain language\u2014offered in multiple languages and accessible formats\u2014and partner with trusted local messengers (schools, libraries, faith and community groups) to improve civics and media literacy, answer questions, and counter misinformation without partisan spin.\n\nWhen people can see how decisions are made, verify that safeguards work, and participate without unnecessary barriers, confidence rises\u2014even among those who disagree on policy\u2014because the system demonstrates fairness, accountability, and respect.",
