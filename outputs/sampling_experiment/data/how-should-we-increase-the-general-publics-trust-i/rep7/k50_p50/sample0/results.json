    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014rises when people can see that decisions are made fairly, consistently, and with real accountability. A practical middle ground is to pair broad, lawful access with strong, verifiable safeguards: clear rules that are applied the same way across places, voter-friendly options (in-person, early, and mail where offered) with protections for eligibility and privacy, and auditable records such as paper trails backed by routine independent audits that are publicly reported in plain language. Institutions should communicate early and often, acknowledge mistakes, explain how they are fixed, and invite bipartisan and community observation without turning administration into politics. Finally, sustained investment in local staffing, training, cybersecurity, and multilingual civic education\u2014delivered through trusted community partners\u2014helps people judge the system by evidence rather than rumors.",

Trust also grows when access is broad and fair\u2014safe in\u2011person, early, and mail options with strong safeguards; accessible polling places and materials for people with disabilities; and information available in multiple languages. Finally, institutions should partner with trusted local messengers (schools, libraries, faith and community groups) to provide practical civic education, correct misinformation with evidence, and openly acknowledge and fix mistakes\u2014so people can see integrity, competence, and respect in action.",
