    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make decisions and outcomes easier for ordinary people to verify, not just to hear about. That means clear, plain-language explanations of rules and procedures; transparent records and reporting; and independent, publicly observable checks such as audits, open meetings, and enforceable ethics and conflict-of-interest standards. Institutions should prioritize equal access and respectful service for all communities (including multilingual communication and disability access), respond quickly and honestly when mistakes happen, and show how problems are fixed. Finally, partnering with trusted local messengers (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups, and community leaders) and investing in civic and media literacy can reduce misinformation and help people feel included, heard, and confident that the system is fair even when they disagree with the outcome.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014we should make decision-making and results easy for ordinary people to verify: use transparent, consistent procedures; maintain auditable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent voter-verifiable trails); and require routine, independent post-election audits with publicly posted findings. Institutions should communicate in plain language and multiple languages, explain how safeguards work from start to finish, and promptly disclose and fix errors so people see accountability in action. Trust also grows when participation is accessible and fair (including for seniors, people with disabilities, working families, and immigrants), oversight is nonpartisan and bipartisan where appropriate, and leaders actively counter misinformation with evidence, civic education, and trusted local messengers. When people can understand the rules, observe the checks, and see problems handled honestly, confidence and engagement rise even when outcomes disappoint.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on transparency people can verify, rules that are applied fairly, and communication that is clear and respectful. That means using secure systems with auditable records (like paper ballots or equivalent paper trails), strong chain-of-custody, and routine independent post\u2011election audits whose results are published in plain language. Institutions should also make participation and services accessible for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and communities that speak languages other than English by providing multilingual materials, well-trained staff, and reliable local points of contact. Just as important, leaders and officials must communicate early and honestly when problems happen, explain how they are fixed, and invite bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight and community observers so the public can see accountability in action. By pairing strong safeguards with practical education and open reporting\u2014through schools, libraries, faith and community groups, and trusted local messengers\u2014we can reduce misinformation, increase understanding, and rebuild trust that decisions and results are legitimate and fair.",
