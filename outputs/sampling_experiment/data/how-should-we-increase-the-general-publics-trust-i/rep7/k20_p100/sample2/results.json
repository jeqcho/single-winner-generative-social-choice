    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, how money is spent, and how mistakes are caught and corrected\u2014without partisan spin. A practical middle-ground approach is to set clear, consistent standards for transparency, ethics, and performance; publish plain-language, multilingual explanations and data (with privacy protections); and use independent oversight such as audits, inspectors general, and citizen review options that report findings publicly. Institutions should engage communities early through town halls, service \u201copen houses,\u201d and trusted local partners, while protecting staff from harassment and enforcing consequences for fraud, misconduct, or deliberate disinformation. When institutions are easier to understand, easier to evaluate, and visibly accountable, trust can be earned over time even among people who disagree on policy.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make key decisions transparent, independently verifiable, and communicated in plain, nonpartisan language. That means clear, consistent rules; secure systems with paper records or equivalent auditable trails; strict chain-of-custody; routine independent, bipartisan audits with publicly posted results; and timely reporting that openly explains any errors and how they were fixed. Institutions should also protect equal access (including accommodations for disabilities and clear multilingual information) and proactively counter misinformation with straightforward public education and opportunities for community observation and engagement. When people can see how decisions are made, verify outcomes for themselves, and know leaders will be accountable to the same rules, trust can grow across political and cultural lines\u2014even when outcomes disappoint them.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make key decisions and results easy for ordinary people to verify, while keeping participation fair and accessible. That means clear, consistent rules; strong security and privacy protections (including secure chain-of-custody, cybersecurity, and verifiable records like paper ballots or auditable paper trails); and routine, independent audits that are publicly reported in plain language. Institutions should communicate early and often with calm, nonpartisan updates, promptly acknowledge mistakes, and show exactly how problems are fixed. Trust also grows when people can observe and engage: open data and documentation where appropriate, public \u201copen house\u201d opportunities, and community partnerships with schools, libraries, faith groups, and local organizations to provide civic education, media literacy, and multilingual information (including Spanish) so everyone can understand the process. Finally, institutions must protect staff and the public from intimidation, enforce rules fairly, and hold officials accountable\u2014because transparency, competence, and equal treatment are what earn lasting trust, even when people disagree with the outcome.",
