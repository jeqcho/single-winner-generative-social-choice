    "new_statement": "To rebuild the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should combine visible, verifiable safeguards with clear, consistent public service. That means transparent procedures people can observe and independently check (auditable paper records or equivalent, routine independent audits with publicly posted findings, secure chain-of-custody, and strong cybersecurity), administered by nonpartisan professionals under uniform minimum standards while allowing local implementation. Trust also requires accessibility and dignity for every eligible voter through well-trained staff, safe polling places, and information in plain language and multiple languages, with accommodations for disabilities. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often\u2014explaining how decisions are made, acknowledging mistakes, showing how problems are corrected, and partnering with trusted community groups, schools, libraries, and faith organizations to provide nonpartisan civic education and counter misinformation with facts rather than spin.",

Administration should be nonpartisan, governed by uniform minimum standards, and treated like critical infrastructure with strong cybersecurity and protections for privacy and election workers.
