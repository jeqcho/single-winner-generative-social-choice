    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see clear standards, fair treatment, and real accountability\u2014especially when things go wrong. We should make key decisions and processes easier to understand through plain-language, multilingual communication; publish measurable performance data and independent audit results; and create regular, public opportunities for community oversight and feedback. Institutions should apply rules consistently, protect privacy and civil rights, and invest in frontline staff so services are reliable and respectful. When leaders disclose conflicts of interest, correct errors quickly, and enforce consequences for misconduct without partisan spin, trust can be rebuilt across political and cultural lines.",

That means clear, consistently applied rules; secure systems with verifiable records (such as paper ballots or auditable equivalents); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine independent, bipartisan audits with plain-language public reporting of what was checked, what was found, and how any problems were fixed. Trust also grows when access is practical and fair for all eligible people\u2014through well-run, accessible polling places, secure early and mail options with safeguards, and materials in multiple languages and formats. Finally, institutions should communicate calmly and honestly, invite public observation and community \u201copen house\u201d oversight, and respond quickly and transparently to mistakes and misinformation. When people can see the rules, see the checks, and see accountability in action, confidence rises even when outcomes disappoint some voters.",

That means clear, consistent rules; open, verifiable records (such as paper-based or otherwise auditable trails); routine independent audits with results published in plain language; strong cybersecurity and privacy protections; and strict chain-of-custody and anti-corruption safeguards. Institutions should communicate early and often\u2014without partisan spin\u2014using simple explanations, visuals, and multilingual materials, and they should promptly admit mistakes, explain fixes, and enforce consequences when standards are broken. Trust also grows when people can see the work up close through community open houses, accessible public meetings, and opportunities for observers from different communities, while ensuring safe workplaces for public servants. Finally, institutions must be reliably accessible\u2014accommodating disabilities, work schedules, and transportation barriers\u2014so people experience fairness not just as a promise, but as consistent, respectful service.",
