Trust also grows when institutions communicate early and often in plain language and multiple languages, publish data and explanations that answer common questions, admit mistakes promptly, and show how problems are fixed. Finally, institutions should invite credible, cross-partisan and community-based oversight\u2014open observation, public \u201copen house\u201d demonstrations, and partnerships with schools, libraries, and faith/community groups\u2014so people can see the process firsthand while keeping administration professional and nonpartisan.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in our elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can clearly see how decisions are made, verify outcomes independently, and participate without unnecessary barriers. For elections, that means using verifiable records such as paper ballots or auditable paper trails; enforcing strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections; and conducting routine, independent post\u2011election audits (e.g., risk\u2011limiting audits) with bipartisan/Nonpartisan oversight and publicly posted results. Institutions should pair these safeguards with clear, plain\u2011language explanations of how systems work, timely reporting of results and any problems (and how they were fixed), and accessible information in multiple languages and formats, including accommodations for disabilities. Finally, ongoing civics and media\u2011literacy education, open houses/observation opportunities, and partnerships with trusted local community groups can reduce misinformation and help people feel respected, included, and confident\u2014even when they disagree with the outcome.",

That means clear, consistently applied rules; secure systems with verifiable records (such as auditable paper trails); routine independent, bipartisan audits with publicly posted findings; and strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity that protect both integrity and privacy. Trust also grows when access is real for everyone: convenient and lawful voting options, safe and well-run polling places, and materials that are plain-language, multilingual, and accessible to people with disabilities. Institutions should communicate early and often with calm, nonpartisan updates; admit mistakes quickly; show exactly how problems are fixed; and counter misinformation with evidence, open data, and community briefings through trusted local messengers like schools, libraries, faith groups, and civic organizations. When people can see how the system works, participate without unnecessary barriers, and watch accountability in action, confidence can rise even when we disagree about outcomes.",
