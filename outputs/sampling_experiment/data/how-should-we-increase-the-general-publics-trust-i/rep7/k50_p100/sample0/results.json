    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules being applied fairly, results being checked independently, and problems being acknowledged and fixed openly. A practical middle ground is to set transparent minimum standards that protect both access and security: voter-friendly options (in-person, early, and mail where offered) paired with strong chain-of-custody, privacy protections, and a verifiable record such as paper ballots or an auditable paper trail. Every election should include routine, independent post-election audits with findings published in plain language and multiple languages, along with regular public briefings and opportunities for community observation that don\u2019t compromise ballot secrecy. Institutions should also invest in professional, nonpartisan administration, consistent funding, and clear penalties for intimidation, corruption, and deliberate disinformation\u2014so accountability is real and understandable to everyday people.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in our institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should pair strong, common\u2011sense safeguards with radical transparency and broad, fair access. That means clear, plain\u2011language explanations of how the system works; verifiable records (such as paper ballots or auditable equivalents); strict chain\u2011of\u2011custody and secure, well\u2011funded administration; and routine independent audits with results published promptly in formats the public can understand. Oversight should be nonpartisan and, where possible, bipartisan, with opportunities for community observation that protect voter privacy and the safety of workers. We should also make participation practical for busy families, seniors, people with disabilities, and language minorities by offering accessible polling places, reliable early and mail options with appropriate verification, and multilingual materials. Finally, leaders and institutions must communicate calmly and honestly about problems, fix errors quickly, and counter misinformation with evidence and open documentation\u2014so people can verify fairness for themselves, even when their preferred side loses.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially election institutions\u2014we should make decision-making and results easy for ordinary people to verify, while keeping services fair and accessible for everyone. That means clear, plain-language explanations (and multilingual materials, including Spanish and other common community languages) about what the rules are, why they exist, and how outcomes are checked; strong, consistently applied standards that protect privacy and security; and independent oversight that is publicly documented. For elections specifically, widely supported steps include verifiable records (such as paper ballots or auditable equivalents), secure chain-of-custody, routine independent post-election audits with public summaries, and safe opportunities for observers from different communities to watch the process without interfering. Institutions should communicate quickly and calmly, acknowledge errors, show how they were corrected, and be accountable when rules are broken. Pairing transparency and accountability with practical access\u2014reasonable accommodations for disabilities, convenient voting options, and well-trained, respectful staff\u2014helps people across backgrounds feel included, protected, and confident that the system works even when their side loses.",
