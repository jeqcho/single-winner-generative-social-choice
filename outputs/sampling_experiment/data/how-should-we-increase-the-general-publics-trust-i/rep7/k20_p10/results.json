    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in elections, we should focus on a few shared, practical commitments: results that can be independently verified, rules that are applied consistently, and communication that people can understand. That means using auditable voting records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), conducting routine risk-limiting post-election audits with publicly posted methods and results, and strengthening basic cybersecurity and chain-of-custody safeguards without collecting unnecessary personal data. Oversight should be independent and transparently bipartisan, with clear roles for local election offices and open channels for credentialed observers. Finally, election officials should provide timely, plain-language and multilingual explanations of how counting, audits, and corrections work, paired with community-based outreach and civic education that helps people spot misinformation while respecting different political views.",

That means independent, bipartisan oversight; paper-based or auditable records; routine post-election risk-limiting audits with publicly posted results; and strong, standardized cybersecurity and training across jurisdictions. Institutions should communicate in plain language, proactively correct errors, and provide accessible, multilingual information and assistance (including for voters with disabilities and diverse communities). Finally, investing in local administration, civic education, and trusted community partners to counter misinformation can improve confidence while keeping governance accountable and nonpartisan.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should make decisions and results easy to verify, easy to understand, and fair to everyone. That means using auditable records (such as paper-backed or otherwise verifiable trails), routine independent post\u2011election audits with publicly available results, and consistent baseline security standards across places while keeping elections locally run. Oversight should be clearly nonpartisan and transparent, with opportunities for bipartisan and community observation, strong protections for voter privacy, and rapid, factual correction of mistakes.\n\nTrust also grows when institutions communicate in plain language, in the languages people actually speak, and in accessible formats for seniors and people with disabilities. Schools and community partners can provide practical civic education and trusted information so young people, working families, and older voters can all understand how processes work and how misinformation is addressed\u2014without politicizing the system or expanding unnecessary centralized control.",
