    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections grows when people can see\u2014clearly and consistently\u2014that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and every eligible voter can participate without unnecessary barriers. A strong middle path is to standardize transparent procedures across jurisdictions, use voter-verified paper records as the backbone of voting, and require routine, publicly reported post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with independent oversight. At the same time, we should invest in well-trained, well-funded local election offices, strong cybersecurity and privacy protections, and accessible options for voters with disabilities, language needs, or limited time. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often in plain language\u2014what will happen, what safeguards exist, and how concerns are resolved\u2014while partnering with trusted community groups and schools to deliver nonpartisan civic education and counter misinformation with facts and humility.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in US elections, we should focus on three shared priorities: transparency, accountability, and broad access. That means using auditable paper-ballot systems wherever possible, conducting routine independent post\u2011election audits (including risk\u2011limiting audits) that the public can understand and observe, and maintaining clear chains of custody and strong cybersecurity. At the same time, voting should be convenient and accessible for every eligible voter\u2014through well-designed early voting and/or mail options with safeguards, accessible polling places and ballots for people with disabilities, and language access\u2014so security never becomes a barrier to participation. Finally, election officials need consistent funding and nonpartisan, plain-language communication that explains how votes are collected, counted, and verified, and that quickly corrects misinformation. When communities can see and verify how the system works\u2014and can participate in it fairly\u2014confidence in institutions grows.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should combine transparency, accountability, and fair access in ways people can see and verify. That means using auditable systems (including voter-verifiable paper records where feasible), conducting independent post-election audits with publicly available results, and setting clear, consistent procedures that are applied the same way across communities while protecting voter privacy. Trust also grows when institutions communicate early and often in plain language, with step-by-step explanations of how decisions are made and how safeguards work, offered in multiple languages and accessible formats. Finally, we should invest in local offices and frontline staff, create easy ways for the public to ask questions and get timely answers, and strengthen civics education in schools and community spaces so families can recognize reliable information and resist misinformation. When people can participate without unnecessary barriers and can independently confirm that rules are followed, confidence in our shared institutions rises.",
