    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014starting with elections\u2014we should pair strong, consistently applied safeguards with transparency that ordinary people can actually see and understand. That means maintaining verifiable records (like paper ballots or equivalent audit trails), routine independent audits whose methods and findings are publicly explained, and clear rules for secure handling of ballots and data. Trust also depends on equal, practical access: well-run polling places, secure and convenient options for eligible voters, and accommodations for disabilities, work schedules, and language needs. Institutions should communicate early and plainly, publish timely updates (including when mistakes happen and how they\u2019re fixed), and invite community observation through nonpartisan \u201copen house\u201d efforts, public reporting dashboards, and partnerships with trusted local messengers. When institutions prove they follow the same rules, show their work, and correct problems openly, confidence can grow across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules and the evidence easy for ordinary people to see, understand, and verify. That means clear, plain-language explanations of how voting works, how ballots are secured (including chain-of-custody and voter privacy), and how results are checked; routine independent, bipartisan post-election audits with publicly posted findings; and verifiable records such as paper ballots or auditable paper trails, backed by strong cybersecurity. Institutions should apply consistent, nonpartisan standards, correct mistakes quickly and transparently, protect workers and the public from intimidation, and provide accessible options and information (including multiple languages and disability accommodations) so eligible people can participate without unnecessary barriers. When accountability is visible, communication is honest and calm, and communities can directly observe how decisions are verified, trust can grow\u2014even when people disagree with the outcome.",

That means maintaining auditable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent verifiable backups), secure chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity, and routine independent post\u2011election audits with results published in plain language. Institutions should also communicate early and often: clear step\u2011by\u2011step explanations of how decisions are made, what safeguards exist, what went wrong if problems occur, and how they were fixed\u2014without partisan spin. Trust grows when access is practical and inclusive (accessible polling places, reliable early and mail options with appropriate safeguards, accommodations for seniors and people with disabilities, and information in English and Spanish), and when local communities can observe, ask questions, and meet the public servants responsible. Finally, institutions should hold leaders accountable for misconduct and deliberate misinformation, while investing in ongoing civics and media\u2011literacy education so families can understand the process and judge claims based on evidence.",
