    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can verify that rules are applied fairly, results are checkable, and leaders are accountable. We should standardize clear, nonpartisan procedures; maintain auditable records (such as paper backups or equivalent voter-verifiable records); conduct routine independent audits; and publish plain-language explanations of how decisions are made and how errors are detected and corrected. Institutions should invite bipartisan and community observation, protect privacy and security, and ensure access for all eligible participants through consistent staffing, language support, and reliable services. Finally, steady public education and rapid, transparent responses to misinformation and mistakes can build confidence over time without requiring anyone to trust a single party, official, or technology.",

That means using verifiable paper records (or equivalent auditable trails), conducting routine independent post\u2011process audits (such as risk\u2011limiting audits), and allowing meaningful, bipartisan/nonpartisan observer access so people can see how results are produced. Institutions should communicate in plain language\u2014with clear public reporting of procedures, timelines, and fixes when problems occur\u2014so misinformation has less room to grow. Trust also rises when rules are applied uniformly, staff are well\u2011trained and properly funded, privacy is protected, and access is fair for every community through language support and practical, welcoming participation options. Combining transparency, security, education, and local community oversight helps people of different viewpoints agree that the process is legitimate, even when they dislike the outcome.",

Institutions should publish simple public dashboards on performance (timelines, error rates, audit findings, complaints and resolutions), enforce consistent standards, and hold leaders accountable when mistakes occur. Finally, sustained civics and media literacy education\u2014starting young\u2014can help people recognize misinformation and understand how to participate, so trust is earned through openness, competence, and equal access rather than slogans or partisan appeals.",
