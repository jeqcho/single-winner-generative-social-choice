    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the work visible, checkable, and consistently fair no matter who is in power. That means clear, uniform rules; strong safeguards for eligible participation; and results that can be independently verified through auditable records (such as paper trails), routine risk-based audits, secure chain-of-custody, and transparent reporting. Oversight should be genuinely bipartisan and complemented by independent experts, with real consequences for errors or misconduct and prompt correction when mistakes happen. Trust also grows when institutions communicate early and often in plain language and multiple languages, partner with credible local messengers, and publish timely, nonpartisan explanations and data that help people distinguish facts from rumors. Finally, sustained funding and staffing for frontline public offices\u2014and respectful service to every community\u2014are essential so accountability and accessibility are not treated as tradeoffs but as shared standards.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should center on transparent, consistent, and verifiable procedures that people can see and understand. That means secure ballot handling with clear chain-of-custody, auditable paper trails (or equivalent verifiable records), routine publicly reported post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible), strong cybersecurity, and independent bipartisan oversight. At the same time, institutions must ensure equal access for all eligible participants, provide clear plain-language information in multiple languages (including Spanish), and communicate promptly and accurately to correct errors and counter misinformation. Trust grows when rules are applied uniformly, accountability is real, and local professionals and community messengers explain the safeguards in a calm, nonpartisan way so everyone can feel confident that results reflect the will of the people.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a simple, shared standard: people should be able to see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and the results are verifiable, no matter who wins. That means clear, uniform procedures; well-trained, nonpartisan professionals running day-to-day operations; and strong transparency measures like auditable paper trails (or verifiable equivalents), strict ballot chain-of-custody, robust cybersecurity, and routine post-election audits with publicly available explanations of what was checked and what was found. Trust also requires real accessibility: convenient options to vote (in-person, early, and by mail where offered), polling places that serve people with disabilities, and plain-language information in the languages communities use\u2014including Spanish\u2014so families know what to expect and how their vote is protected. When mistakes happen, institutions should acknowledge them quickly, correct them openly, and hold systems accountable, while proactively countering misinformation with calm, factual communication from trusted local messengers (educators, faith and community leaders, and civic groups). By pairing integrity with inclusion\u2014security with service\u2014we can strengthen confidence that institutions work for everyone and that outcomes reflect the will of the people.",
