    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real accountability, regardless of who is in power. A practical middle path is to pair strong integrity measures (auditable records like paper ballots or voter-verifiable trails, secure chain-of-custody, routine independent post-election audits with published methods and results, and modern cybersecurity) with broad, non-discriminatory access (convenient polling options, disability accommodations, multilingual materials, and timely help for voters). Institutions should communicate early and often in plain language: what safeguards exist, what went wrong if problems occur, and how issues were fixed\u2014without spin or partisan blame. Finally, create ongoing, local channels for public oversight and participation\u2014bipartisan/nonpartisan observer programs, open data dashboards, community briefings, and well-trained staff\u2014so trust is built through evidence, transparency, and respectful engagement rather than slogans.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can verify that rules are fair, results are accurate, and leaders are accountable in everyday, visible ways. Institutions should set clear, consistent standards and then prove they are followed: auditable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent voter-verifiable trails), strong chain-of-custody, robust cybersecurity, and routine independent, bipartisan post-process audits (including risk-limiting audits) with methods and findings published in plain language.\n\nTrust also depends on access and dignity. Make participation practical for working people, families, seniors, and people with disabilities through well-run polling locations, reasonable hours, and secure options like early voting and trackable mail voting where used\u2014paired with safeguards that prevent fraud and protect privacy. Finally, communicate early and often through nonpartisan, multilingual public education, transparent incident reporting (what happened, what it means, how it was fixed), and opportunities for community observation and feedback. When institutions combine verifiable checks with clear communication and equal treatment, confidence rises even among people who disagree about politics.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see, understand, and independently verify that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and officials are accountable.\n\nA strong, broadly acceptable approach is to pair (1) verifiable transparency with (2) practical, respectful access:\n- Verifiable transparency: use auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails where relevant), protect chain-of-custody, and conduct routine, independent post-event audits (e.g., risk-limiting audits) with results published in plain language. When mistakes or disruptions occur, report them quickly, explain what happened, and document how they were fixed.\n- Security and privacy: invest in modern cybersecurity, protect personal data, and keep clear boundaries against partisan interference, intimidation, and conflicts of interest.\n- Practical access and consistency: make participation workable for busy workers, seniors, people with disabilities, and multilingual communities through well-staffed sites, reasonable hours, clear eligibility rules, and secure options that are easy to track and understand.\n- Ongoing public communication: provide nonpartisan civic education through schools, libraries, community groups, and local forums, using straightforward materials in multiple languages and formats.\n\nThis combination\u2014transparent methods people can inspect, consistent rules, and dignified access\u2014helps supporters of both stronger integrity safeguards and broader participation agree on a shared goal: outcomes the public can verify and accept, even when their preferred side loses.",
