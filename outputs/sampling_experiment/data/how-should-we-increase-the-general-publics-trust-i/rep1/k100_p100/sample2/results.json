    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, consistent enforcement, and real consequences for mistakes or misconduct. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity measures (auditable records, routine independent audits, secure chain-of-custody, and modern cybersecurity) with broad, equal access (convenient voting options, disability accommodations, and multilingual, plain-language information). Institutions should communicate early and often with the public\u2014publishing easy-to-read dashboards, incident reports, and audit findings\u2014while creating open channels for questions, observation, and community feedback through town halls, bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight, and citizen volunteering. Trust is rebuilt when institutions are transparent about what worked, honest about what didn\u2019t, and demonstrably committed to fixing problems without favoring any party or community.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when rules are clear, processes are transparent, and results are independently verifiable without making participation harder for eligible people. That means using auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), protecting chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and conducting routine, publicly reported post\u2011election audits (including risk\u2011limiting audits) so the public can see that outcomes match the ballots cast. Trust also depends on nonpartisan, professionally run administration with bipartisan/independent oversight, prompt disclosure of problems and how they were fixed, and plain\u2011language, multilingual explanations of how voting, counting, and certification work. Finally, institutions should pair strong safeguards with practical access\u2014reliable polling places, early and secure mail/absentee options where offered, disability accommodations, and well-trained poll workers\u2014so integrity and inclusion reinforce each other rather than compete.",

Institutions should make participation straightforward for working people, seniors, people with disabilities, and multilingual communities by offering reliable polling locations and hours, accessible materials, language support, and secure options that fit real-life schedules\u2014without sacrificing integrity.\n\nFinally, confidence rises when leaders and officials communicate calmly and honestly: reporting problems quickly, explaining what happened and how it was fixed, countering misinformation with evidence, and inviting bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight and community observers.
