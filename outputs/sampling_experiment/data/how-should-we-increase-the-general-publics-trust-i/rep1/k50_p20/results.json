    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can both verify the rules are fair and experience the system as respectful and responsive. A practical middle ground is to set clear, consistent procedures; keep a voter-verifiable record for every ballot (such as paper or an equivalent independent audit trail); and require routine, independent post-event audits with publicly accessible results and explanations in plain language. At the same time, participation should be straightforward and secure: reliable polling locations and hours, well-designed ballots, strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and accommodations for language, disability, and work or caregiving schedules. Institutions should also publish timely incident reports when problems occur\u2014what happened, what was fixed, and who is accountable\u2014while partnering with trusted local messengers to answer questions and counter misinformation without partisanship. When transparency, security, access, and accountability are built into the system and communicated clearly, people with different views can disagree about outcomes without doubting the legitimacy of the process.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild public trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the process easy to observe, and the results independently verifiable. That starts with nonpartisan administration, consistent procedures, and strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections for voter rolls and ballots. Wherever feasible, use voter-verifiable paper records (or robust audit trails) and conduct routine, independent risk-limiting audits with bipartisan and community observers, then publish the methods and findings in plain language so people can see how outcomes were confirmed.\n\nTrust also depends on access and dignity: convenient polling locations and hours, secure options like early voting and well-designed absentee systems, language assistance, and accommodations so eligible voters can participate without unnecessary barriers while preserving privacy. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and credibly when problems occur\u2014what happened, what was fixed, and how it was verified\u2014while partnering with trusted local messengers to counter misinformation with transparent facts. When people can understand the rules, watch the safeguards work, and verify the results, confidence grows even when their preferred side loses.",
