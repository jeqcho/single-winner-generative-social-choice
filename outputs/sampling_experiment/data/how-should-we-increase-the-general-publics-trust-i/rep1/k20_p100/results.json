    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014including elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules applied consistently, verify that outcomes match the evidence, and feel that the system treats everyone with dignity. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity measures (auditable records such as paper ballots or equivalent, secure chain-of-custody, routine independent risk-limiting audits, and public reporting of findings and incidents) with broad, fair access (convenient voting options, disability accommodations, and multilingual, plain-language guidance). Institutions should communicate early and often in a calm, nonpartisan way: explain what is known, what is being checked, and how problems are fixed\u2014without dismissing concerns or inflaming them. Finally, invite public participation through bipartisan and citizen observation, open data where appropriate, and regular community forums, so trust is earned through transparency, accountability, and consistent performance over time.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can clearly see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and the results can be independently verified without favoring any party. That starts with transparent, auditable procedures: voter-verifiable paper ballots or equivalent auditable records, strict chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and routine independent post-election audits (such as risk-limiting audits) with methods and results published in plain language. Trust also depends on accessibility and dignity for every eligible voter, including convenient polling options and clear, multilingual, disability-accessible information about how to register, vote, and track a ballot where available. Finally, institutions should communicate promptly and calmly about issues and fixes, welcome nonpartisan observers and community volunteers, and invest in ongoing civics and media literacy so misinformation has less room to grow. When people can understand the steps, observe the safeguards, and see mistakes acknowledged and corrected, confidence in the outcome\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014can be rebuilt.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a simple standard: people trust what they can see, verify, and access fairly. That means institutions should publish clear rules in plain language, apply them consistently, and show their work through independent oversight, routine audits, and open reporting of results and any problems that occurred and how they were fixed.\n\nFor elections specifically, that looks like verifiable ballots (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable records), secure chain-of-custody, strong cybersecurity, and post-election audits whose methods and findings are public and easy to understand. It also means protecting access for eligible voters\u2014convenient polling locations and hours, accommodations for disabilities, language access, and secure options like early voting or mail voting where offered\u2014so people don\u2019t feel forced to choose between participation and daily responsibilities.\n\nFinally, rebuilding trust requires respectful, nonpartisan communication: timely updates from local officials, community briefings where residents can ask questions, and civics and media-literacy education that helps families and young people understand the process and spot misinformation. When institutions pair transparency and accountability with equal treatment and real-world accessibility, confidence rises across communities and political views.",
