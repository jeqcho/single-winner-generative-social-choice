    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can clearly see the rules, the evidence, and the consequences\u2014especially when things go wrong. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity safeguards with broad, dignified access: use auditable records, routine independent audits, clear chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards, and publish plain-language results and incident reports that explain what happened, what was fixed, and how it was verified. At the same time, make participation straightforward through accessible locations and hours, reasonable identity and eligibility checks that don\u2019t create unnecessary barriers, and multilingual, disability-friendly information. Finally, institutions should invite public accountability\u2014open meetings, citizen observers across viewpoints, and ongoing community feedback\u2014while leaders commit to accurate, non-inflammatory communication that corrects misinformation without dismissing legitimate questions. Trust is rebuilt when transparency, fairness, and responsiveness are visible to everyone, not dependent on which side wins.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in the institutions that run them\u2014grows when people can verify that rules are fair, outcomes are accurate, and every eligible voter can participate without unnecessary barriers. A practical consensus approach is: (1) make voting and counting transparent and auditable through voter-verifiable paper ballots (or equivalent paper records), strong chain-of-custody, and routine, publicly observed post-election risk-limiting audits with results published in plain language; (2) protect systems and data with modern cybersecurity and clear incident reporting that explains what happened and how it was fixed; (3) ensure access and equal treatment with convenient options like early voting and secure mail voting where used, disability accommodations, and multilingual, nonpartisan information about how ballots are cast, tracked, counted, and certified; and (4) strengthen accountability with nonpartisan election administration, bipartisan/independent oversight, consistent baseline standards, and opportunities for citizens to observe or serve as poll workers. Trust is rebuilt not by slogans, but by clear procedures, independent verification, and respectful communication that reduces misinformation and shows, step by step, that every lawful vote is counted once and counted correctly.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can clearly see three things: the rules are fair, the work is done competently, and mistakes are acknowledged and corrected. A practical path is to make core processes more transparent and independently verifiable\u2014publish plain-language explanations of how decisions are made, keep auditable records, use routine third\u2011party audits, and report problems and fixes promptly. Institutions should also be easy to use and respectful of people\u2019s real lives by offering accessible services (including multilingual and disability-access formats), predictable timelines, and clear ways to ask questions and appeal decisions. To reduce polarization and rumors, leaders and media partners should share consistent, nonpartisan facts, disclose conflicts of interest, and avoid premature or sensational claims\u2014while enforcing strong protections against fraud, intimidation, and misuse of data. Finally, trust strengthens when accountability is local and visible: well-trained staff, community oversight that includes diverse residents, and opportunities for ordinary people to observe, volunteer, and provide feedback\u2014so confidence is earned through evidence and everyday experience, not slogans.",
