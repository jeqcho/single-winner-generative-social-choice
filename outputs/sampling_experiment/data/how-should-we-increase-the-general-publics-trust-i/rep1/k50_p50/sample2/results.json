    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, check the work, and hold leaders accountable\u2014without shutting anyone out. A practical middle path is to standardize clear, enforceable rules that protect both integrity and access: strong security and privacy protections, well-documented chains of custody for sensitive records, routine independent audits (with public summaries), and transparent reporting that distinguishes verified facts from unresolved questions. Institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual language, publish easy-to-read data and timelines, and create regular public forums where residents can ask questions and get answers from frontline staff\u2014not just political spokespeople. Finally, trust increases when mistakes are acknowledged quickly, investigations are truly independent, and consequences are real, while community members are invited to participate through advisory boards, volunteer roles, and civic education that builds media literacy and reduces misinformation.",

We should standardize transparent, nonpartisan procedures such as voter\u2011verifiable paper records (or equivalent auditable trails), strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody, routine independent risk\u2011limiting audits, and hardened cybersecurity with timely public incident reporting. Just as important, institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual language: publish easy-to-read explanations of how decisions are made and results are certified, share open data dashboards where appropriate, and hold local forums where residents can observe processes, ask questions, and volunteer. Protect broad, equal access while enforcing consistent safeguards so every eligible person can participate without unnecessary barriers. When verification is routine, information is understandable, and community oversight is welcomed, trust can be earned across political and cultural differences.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the processes verifiable, and the people in charge visibly accountable, without making participation harder for eligible residents.\n\nThat means: (1) transparent, step-by-step procedures the public can understand (plain-language explanations, multilingual materials, and timely incident reporting); (2) evidence that outcomes are correct (voter-verifiable records such as paper ballots where feasible, secure chain-of-custody, routine post-election risk-limiting audits, and independent/bipartisan oversight with results published in easy-to-read summaries and open data dashboards); and (3) strong protections against interference (cybersecurity investments, privacy safeguards, and clear penalties for intimidation or tampering).\n\nTrust also grows when institutions engage people locally and respectfully: open houses at election offices, town halls, opportunities for residents to observe and volunteer, and partnerships with schools, libraries, faith groups, and community organizations to counter misinformation with consistent facts. If people can see how decisions are made, how errors are caught and corrected, and how access is protected for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and language minorities, confidence in institutions can rise across political and cultural lines.",
