    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify outcomes independently, and experience fair treatment in everyday interactions. That means setting clear, consistently applied rules; publishing understandable performance data and budgets; and building in real accountability\u2014independent audits, open records, strong ethics enforcement, and meaningful consequences when mistakes or misconduct occur. Institutions should communicate early and often in plain language, correct errors transparently, and make it easy for the public to ask questions and get timely answers. Trust also requires equal access and respectful service across communities, including multilingual and disability-accessible options, so people feel heard rather than managed. Finally, leaders and media should commit to responsible, evidence-based messaging that reduces misinformation without silencing debate, so disagreement can happen without undermining the legitimacy of the system itself.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on procedures people can verify, rules people can understand, and oversight people can see. That means using secure, auditable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent audit trails), protecting chain-of-custody, hardening cybersecurity, and conducting routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits) with publicly posted methods and results. Trust also grows when institutions communicate plainly and consistently: clear, nonpartisan explanations of how decisions are made and corrected when errors occur, timely reporting, and accessible information in multiple languages and formats. Finally, institutions should make participation straightforward and respectful\u2014accessible locations and hours, reasonable safeguards that protect eligibility and privacy, and opportunities for community observation and volunteering\u2014so confidence comes not from slogans, but from transparent, accountable practice that treats every person with dignity.",

That means using systems the public can check (such as paper records or strong audit trails), conducting routine independent audits with published methods and findings, protecting data and systems with modern cybersecurity, and maintaining strict chain-of-custody so people can see how decisions and outcomes are produced. Trust also grows when institutions communicate plainly and promptly about what happened, what went wrong (if anything), and how it was fixed\u2014without spin.\n\nAt the same time, institutions must earn trust by being accessible and fair: information in plain language and multiple languages, accommodations for disabilities, convenient and consistent service hours, and straightforward ways for residents to ask questions, observe processes, and file concerns. Finally, long-term trust requires reducing incentives that make people feel outcomes are \u201crigged\u201d\u2014through strong ethics rules, transparent funding and contracting, and guardrails against manipulation\u2014paired with ongoing civic education and local partnerships so verification comes not just from officials, but from neighbors and community groups who can see the evidence for themselves.",
