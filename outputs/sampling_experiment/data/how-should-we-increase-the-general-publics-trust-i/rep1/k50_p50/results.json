    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and experience services that work reliably in everyday life. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity safeguards with broad, respectful access: clear and stable rules, transparent reporting of performance and incidents (including mistakes and how they were fixed), independent audits and oversight with publicly posted methods, and firm protections against fraud, interference, intimidation, and corruption. Institutions should communicate in plain language, in multiple languages and formats, through trusted local messengers, and make it easy for the public to participate and observe\u2014public meetings, open records that protect privacy, and opportunities for community members to serve on advisory boards or as trained volunteers. Finally, accountability should be real and nonpartisan: consequences for wrongdoing, protections for whistleblowers, and ongoing improvement based on evidence and public feedback so trust is earned through consistent, visible competence rather than slogans.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can clearly see that the rules are fair, the process is secure, and the results are independently verifiable. That means using auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), maintaining strict chain-of-custody and strong cybersecurity, and conducting routine, nonpartisan post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits) with methods and findings published in plain language. Trust also depends on equal, practical access: convenient polling locations and hours, secure early and mail voting where offered, disability accommodations, and multilingual information so every eligible voter can participate without confusion or undue burden. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and transparently about how ballots are handled, counted, and certified; report problems and fixes openly; invite bipartisan observers and trained community volunteers; and counter misinformation with consistent, evidence-based public education. When accountability is visible and participation is respectful and straightforward, confidence in the outcome\u2014and in the institution\u2014can rebuild across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared, practical principles: make decisions and results verifiable, communicate clearly, and treat every person with equal dignity.\n\nFirst, institutions should adopt transparent, auditable procedures that ordinary people can understand and independent experts can verify. For elections, that means voter-verifiable paper ballots (or equivalent auditable records), strong chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits after every election, publicly posted audit methods and findings, and serious cybersecurity for registration and reporting systems.\n\nSecond, trust grows when rules are consistent, fairly enforced, and insulated from partisan pressure. Institutions should use nonpartisan professional administration, independent oversight with representation across viewpoints, clear accountability when mistakes occur, and prompt public incident reporting with corrective actions.\n\nThird, institutions must be accessible and responsive to the public they serve. That includes convenient options to participate (e.g., early voting, secure mail/absentee voting where offered, reliable in-person sites), accommodations for disability and work schedules, and plain-language, multilingual information that explains\u2014step by step\u2014how processes work and how concerns can be raised and resolved.\n\nFinally, rebuild trust through community presence: open houses, observation opportunities, local partnerships (schools, libraries, faith and civic groups), and ongoing civic education that counters misinformation with timely, factual updates. When people can see the safeguards, understand the rules, and experience fair treatment firsthand, confidence in institutions can grow across political, cultural, and generational lines.",
