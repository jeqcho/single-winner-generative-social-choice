    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and verify how decisions are made\u2014and when the rules are applied consistently to everyone. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity safeguards (clear standards, independent audits/inspections, secure records and data protections, and real consequences for misconduct) with genuine accessibility and service (plain-language explanations, multilingual information, disability accommodations, and easy-to-use ways for the public to participate and give feedback). Institutions should publish timely, understandable reports about performance, errors, and fixes; open more processes to neutral observers; and invest in frontline staff and modern systems so service is reliable in every community. Finally, leaders and media should avoid partisan spin around basic facts and instead commit to transparent evidence-sharing, so disagreements can focus on policy choices rather than suspicions about hidden or rigged processes.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules, fair treatment, and reliable results.

Trust also depends on consistent, nonpartisan administration with bipartisan and citizen observation, prompt and honest incident reporting, and real accountability when mistakes or interference occur.\n\nAt the same time, institutions should make participation straightforward and respectful for all eligible people: accessible polling places and hours, secure early and mail options with tracking where used, disability and language accommodations, and clear multilingual voter information. Finally, sustained civic education and timely, factual communication that counters misinformation\u2014delivered through trusted local messengers\u2014helps demystify the process so confidence is built on evidence rather than rumor.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should make the rules clear, the work verifiable, and the decision-making understandable to ordinary people. That means using auditable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits) with methods and results published in plain language and multiple languages. Trust also grows when access is practical for working families, people with disabilities, and those who move often: reliable polling locations, reasonable early-voting hours, secure and trackable mail voting where offered, and well-trained poll workers who treat everyone with respect.\n\nInstitutions should communicate early and often\u2014what safeguards exist, what problems occurred, and how they were fixed\u2014through channels people already use (local news, schools, community groups, and online dashboards), while protecting voter privacy and enforcing strong penalties for intimidation, interference, or fraud. Finally, we should reduce perceptions of \u201crigged rules\u201d by strengthening nonpartisan administration and oversight, inviting bipartisan/community observers, and applying consistent standards and accountability across jurisdictions. When people can see the process, check it, and participate without barriers, confidence rises even among those who disagree politically.",
