    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are applied fairly, and experience those institutions as responsive in everyday life. We should set clear, consistent standards for transparency (plain-language explanations, open data where appropriate, and independent oversight), strong integrity safeguards (audits, conflict-of-interest rules, and protections against fraud or abuse), and real accessibility (multilingual communication, disability accommodations, and low-barrier ways to participate and raise concerns). Institutions should proactively correct misinformation with timely, nonpartisan facts, and create trusted local feedback channels\u2014community meetings, ombuds offices, and rapid complaint resolution\u2014so problems are acknowledged and fixed. When leaders model honesty, protect equal rights, and measure performance publicly, trust can be earned across political, cultural, and generational lines.",

We should use verifiable records (such as paper ballots or other auditable backups), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine independent, risk\u2011limiting audits with bipartisan and community oversight. Institutions should explain processes and results in clear, plain language, publish methods and key data for public scrutiny, and provide accurate updates quickly while protecting privacy. Trust also depends on equal access: remove practical barriers, offer accommodations for disability, language, and mobility needs, and ensure convenient, lawful options so every eligible person can participate. Finally, sustained nonpartisan civic education, partnerships with trusted local leaders, and rapid myth\u2011busting can reduce misinformation and show that institutions listen, correct mistakes, and serve the common good.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should pair strong, verifiable integrity measures with clear, everyday accountability and equal, respectful service for all communities. That means using auditable records (like paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), routine independent audits, strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody protections, and transparent oversight that includes members from different parties and perspectives. Institutions should also communicate decisions and results in plain language, publish the data and methods people can check, and provide timely answers when problems occur.\n\nJust as important, trust grows when institutions are easy to access and treat people fairly: services and voting information should be available in multiple languages, accessible for people with disabilities, and reachable for rural, working, and elderly residents through practical options and clear instructions. Finally, rebuilding trust requires ongoing civic education, partnerships with trusted local messengers (schools, community groups, faith leaders, and professional organizations), and consistent consequences for misconduct\u2014so people can see that the rules apply to everyone and that institutions earn trust through transparency, competence, and fairness over time.",
