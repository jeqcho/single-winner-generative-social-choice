    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on procedures people can verify and leaders can explain. That means clear, uniform baseline standards for security and ballot handling, paper or otherwise voter-verifiable records, routine independent post-election audits with publicly posted results, and strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections. Access should be practical for all eligible voters (including rural communities, people with disabilities, and working families) while safeguarding privacy and civil liberties, and any ID or eligibility checks should be reliable, nondiscriminatory, and paired with easy ways to obtain required documents. Finally, institutions should communicate consistently in plain language, share data and timelines openly, invite bipartisan and nonpartisan observers, and invest in civics and media literacy so misinformation has less room to take hold.",

That means using verifiable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), maintaining secure chain-of-custody and robust cybersecurity, and conducting routine, independent post-process audits (including risk-limiting audits) with results published in plain language. Institutions should also communicate consistently and proactively\u2014sharing what standards are used, what went wrong when issues occur, and how problems are fixed\u2014so people can see accountability in action. Finally, trust grows when participation is genuinely workable for everyone: accessible voting options (in-person and mail where available), disability and language access, well-trained staff, and sustained civics and media-literacy education delivered through trusted local partners to reduce misinformation and help the public understand how integrity is protected.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on transparency people can see, consistent rules people can understand, and accountability that is truly nonpartisan. That means setting clear, statewide (and where feasible nationwide) standards for how votes are cast, handled, counted, and reported; using verifiable records (such as paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails); protecting chain-of-custody; and conducting routine, independent, publicly reported post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits) so outcomes can be checked and explained. At the same time, we should make participation practical and secure for all eligible voters\u2014rural and urban, working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and voters who speak languages other than English\u2014through well-run in-person and mail options, strong cybersecurity and privacy protections, and well-trained front-line staff. Finally, trust grows when institutions communicate early and clearly: provide plain-language explanations of procedures and timelines, share audit results and key data openly, and counter misinformation through credible, cross-partisan messengers and local community partners. The goal is a system that is fair, secure, and verifiable\u2014so people with different political views can independently see that the rules were followed and every eligible vote was counted.",
