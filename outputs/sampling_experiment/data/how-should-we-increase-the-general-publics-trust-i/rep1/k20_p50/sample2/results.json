    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when they are transparent about how decisions are made, consistently follow fair rules, and can be independently checked. A practical middle ground is to strengthen clear standards, strong security and privacy protections, and routine third\u2011party audits or oversight\u2014with results published in plain language\u2014while making services and participation accessible to everyone (including people with disabilities, different languages, rural communities, and busy workers). Institutions should communicate early and honestly about what went well, what went wrong, and what will change, and create regular ways for the public to ask questions, observe processes where appropriate, and file complaints that are resolved on a clear timeline. Finally, leaders and media should model responsible conduct\u2014separating facts from speculation, correcting errors quickly, and accepting verified outcomes\u2014so confidence is built through evidence and accountability rather than slogans.",

At the same time, institutions must make participation genuinely accessible\u2014reasonable hours, accessible locations, language and disability accommodations, and secure options like early voting or trackable mail ballots\u2014so safeguards don\u2019t become barriers.

We should set transparent, nonpartisan standards for how decisions are made and how public funds are used; publish plain-language explanations and open data that show what happened and why; and require independent oversight (audits, inspector generals, and bipartisan/community review) so mistakes or misconduct are found and fixed quickly. Institutions should also make access practical for working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and multilingual communities by offering services and information in multiple languages, improving customer-service responsiveness, and creating simple ways to track requests, complaints, and outcomes. Finally, leaders and agencies must communicate consistently\u2014before and after decisions\u2014correct misinformation with evidence, protect privacy and civil liberties, and invite the public to observe, ask questions, and participate through local forums, volunteer roles, and community partnerships. When the process is visible, verifiable, and respectful to everyone, trust can be earned across political and cultural differences.",
