    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in public institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can verify that rules are fair, consistently applied, and enforced without partisan favoritism. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity measures (auditable paper records, transparent chain-of-custody, routine independent post-election audits, and secure, well-tested technology) with broad, non-discriminatory access (clear registration and eligibility rules, convenient in-person and absentee options, disability and language accommodations, and reliable local polling resources). Institutions should communicate early and often in plain language\u2014what safeguards exist, what went wrong if problems occur, and how issues were fixed\u2014while inviting bipartisan and citizen observation under clear standards that protect voter privacy. Finally, long-term trust requires ongoing civic education and independent oversight that reduces misinformation and shows, with evidence, that every eligible vote is counted once and results match the verified record.",

Institutions should adopt transparent, verifiable practices: publish clear rules and performance metrics; protect data and systems with strong cybersecurity; invite independent, nonpartisan audits and oversight; and publicly report findings in plain language so outcomes can be checked and understood. At the same time, access and fairness must be practical for everyday life\u2014services should be easy to use, information should be multilingual and disability-accessible, and communities should have real channels to ask questions and observe processes. Finally, institutions should communicate early and often, correct misinformation with timely facts, enforce consistent standards, and hold leaders accountable for ethics and conflicts of interest. When institutions are reliable, open to scrutiny, and respectful of all communities, confidence can rebuild across political and cultural lines.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should make the work of those institutions easier to verify, easier to access, and harder to politicize\u2014so people can see that rules are fair, decisions are evidence-based, and mistakes are acknowledged and corrected.\n\nThat means: (1) transparency that is understandable to non-experts (plain-language explanations, clear data dashboards, open meetings where appropriate, and timely public reports); (2) independent oversight and regular audits that are publicly documented (with clear standards, conflict-of-interest rules, and consequences when performance falls short); (3) strong security and privacy protections (so systems are resilient without exposing personal information); and (4) real-world accessibility and respectful service (multilingual communication, disability accommodations, predictable hours and procedures, and channels for complaints that actually lead to fixes).\n\nTrust grows fastest when local, trusted messengers\u2014educators, community organizations, healthcare workers, faith and civic leaders\u2014are included in two-way communication, not just one-way messaging. Institutions should show their work, publish what they measure, explain what they\u2019re changing, and treat every person with dignity, regardless of politics or background.",
