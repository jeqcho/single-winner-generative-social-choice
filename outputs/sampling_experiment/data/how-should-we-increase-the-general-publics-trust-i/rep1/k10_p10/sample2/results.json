We should use voting systems with a clear paper record, conduct routine independent audits, strengthen cybersecurity, and make key procedures and results reporting transparent without compromising ballot secrecy. Institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual language about how decisions are made, what safeguards exist, and how problems are investigated and corrected, including timely public explanations when mistakes occur. Just as important, oversight should be broadly representative and nonpartisan, with clear standards against intimidation and unequal access, so every community can participate confidently and feel the system is accountable to the public rather than to any party or interest.",

That means clear, consistent rules; transparent administration by trained, nonpartisan professionals; and safeguards that are easy to explain and independently check: paper ballots or auditable paper trails, routine risk-limiting audits, strong cybersecurity, and appropriately managed, bipartisan/nonpartisan observation. Institutions should report results and any problems promptly, explain what happened in plain language, and show how issues were corrected. Trust also depends on fairness and access: protect voters from intimidation, provide reliable polling options and reasonable early/accessible voting, and offer clear multilingual public education so every community can participate with confidence and dignity.",

Oversight should be independent and nonpartisan, with trained observers and clear standards that are applied the same way across communities while protecting voter privacy and preventing intimidation.
