    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see consistent rules applied fairly, mistakes handled openly, and results verified independently. A practical middle ground is to pair strong integrity measures (auditable records such as paper ballots or equivalent verifiable trails, strict chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits, and transparent incident reporting) with broad, nondiscriminatory access (accessible polling places, reasonable accommodations for disabilities and language needs, and multiple secure ways to vote). Institutions should communicate in plain, nonpartisan language, publish methods and audit findings in formats the public can understand, and create real opportunities for community oversight\u2014public observation, bipartisan review, and local forums where residents can ask questions and get timely, factual answers. When institutions are both secure and welcoming, and when accountability is visible rather than assumed, confidence can rebuild across political and cultural lines.",

That means nonpartisan administration; verifiable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent paper trails); strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and routine, independent post-election audits (including risk-limiting audits) with methods and findings published in plain language. Trust also grows when institutions communicate early and honestly about how processes work, what safeguards exist, and how mistakes are identified and corrected\u2014using clear, multilingual information through schools, libraries, and trusted community partners. Finally, invite public accountability through open data dashboards, observation opportunities, and community forums, so confidence comes from transparent procedures that ordinary people can see, inspect, and understand\u2014not from partisan claims.",
