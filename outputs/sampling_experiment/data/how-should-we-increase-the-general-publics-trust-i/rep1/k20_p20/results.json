    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when the rules are clear, the work is visible, and the results can be independently verified without excluding eligible participants. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, testable safeguards (paper records where feasible, routine post-process audits, transparent chain-of-custody standards, and modern cybersecurity) with nonpartisan administration and public reporting that ordinary people can understand. Institutions should communicate early and often in plain, multilingual language, publish data and audit summaries in accessible formats, and invite structured community participation\u2014poll workers, observers, and public briefings\u2014so trust is built through shared oversight rather than partisan claims. At the same time, protections against intimidation, targeted suppression, and misinformation should be enforced consistently, while access remains straightforward for working families, rural communities, seniors, and people with disabilities. Trust won\u2019t come from slogans; it comes from procedures that are fair, open to scrutiny, and reliably deliver the same standards for everyone.",

That means auditable paper records, routine risk-limiting post\u2011election audits, strong chain\u2011of\u2011custody and cybersecurity protections, and clear public reporting of what was checked and what was found. Trust also grows when people can understand and observe the process: plain\u2011language explanations of how votes are counted and certified, consistent standards that reduce confusion across jurisdictions, and bipartisan/community oversight including more trained poll workers and observers. Finally, we should invest in civic education and multilingual outreach and respond quickly to misinformation with credible, nonpartisan facts\u2014so security, fairness, and access are strengthened together rather than traded off.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the general public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few shared, practical basics: make key decisions and outcomes transparent, independently verifiable, and communicated in plain, nonpartisan language. For elections, that means auditable paper ballots or voter-verifiable records, routine risk-limiting audits, strong chain-of-custody rules, and cybersecurity protections, with bipartisan and community oversight and timely public reporting of results and audit findings. Trust also grows when institutions are accessible and respectful: consistent rules that are easy to follow, well-staffed local offices, convenient and secure voting options that work for seniors, working families, rural residents, and people with disabilities, and multilingual materials and outreach so non-English speakers can understand their rights and the process. Finally, we should invest in civic education and rapid, evidence-based responses to misinformation, while protecting civil liberties and ensuring reforms do not burden eligible participation. When people can see how decisions are made, verify the safeguards, and experience fair treatment in practice, confidence in institutions rises across political and cultural lines.",
