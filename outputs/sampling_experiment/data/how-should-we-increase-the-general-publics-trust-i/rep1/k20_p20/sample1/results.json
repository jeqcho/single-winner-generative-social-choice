    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and influence how decisions are made\u2014and when the same rules apply to everyone. A practical middle ground is to pair strong safeguards with everyday accessibility: publish clear, plain-language explanations of policies and results; open key processes to independent review (audits, inspectors general, ombuds offices, citizen oversight panels); and report mistakes quickly with timelines for fixes and consequences when standards aren\u2019t met. Institutions should make participation easier through multilingual, disability-accessible services, predictable rules, and responsive local points of contact, while protecting privacy and security. Finally, leaders and agencies should commit to evidence-based communication\u2014sharing data, naming uncertainties, and correcting misinformation without partisan tone\u2014so accountability is visible and trust can be earned over time.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see clear rules applied fairly, with results that are verifiable and easy to understand. We should use secure, auditable systems (including paper ballots or voter-verifiable paper trails), strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and routine independent audits such as risk-limiting audits, with transparent public reporting of what was checked and what was found. Just as important, participation should be straightforward and accessible: convenient polling options (early, weekend, mail where available), welcoming and well-trained poll workers, and plain-language, multilingual information that explains each step from casting a ballot to certifying results. Finally, institutions should communicate quickly and honestly about mistakes and fixes, invite public observation and community oversight, and help counter misinformation with calm, factual civic education\u2014so accountability is visible and trust can be earned across political lines.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on a few standards that people across backgrounds can agree to: clear rules, consistent procedures, and proof that the system works. That means using verifiable records (like paper backups where relevant), strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody practices, and routine independent audits whose methods and results are published in plain language. Institutions should communicate early and often\u2014admitting mistakes, explaining how they were fixed, and sharing easy-to-read dashboards and local reports\u2014so rumors don\u2019t fill the silence.\n\nTrust also depends on fairness and accessibility. Institutions should make it straightforward for eligible people to participate and get help: convenient hours, options that fit working families and rural communities, disability and language accommodations, and respectful front-line service. Finally, rebuilding confidence requires real local accountability: bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight, open public observation where appropriate, ongoing community forums, and civics education that explains how safeguards work. When people can see the checks, understand the process, and feel treated fairly, trust grows.",
