    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can verify that decisions are made fairly, competently, and without favoritism. A practical middle ground is to focus on transparency and accountability: use auditable voting systems (including a reliable paper record), conduct routine independent post-election audits, and publish plain-language, timely explanations of results, problems, and fixes. Protect both access and integrity by keeping voting convenient for working families, seniors, rural voters, and people with disabilities while maintaining strong chain-of-custody rules and cybersecurity. Build confidence year-round through nonpartisan civic education and community partnerships (schools, libraries, local media, faith and civic groups) that address misinformation with evidence and respect. The goal isn\u2019t to ask people to \u2018trust us,\u2019 but to create processes that any reasonable person\u2014regardless of party\u2014can observe, understand, and check.",

Trust also grows when rules are consistent and predictable across jurisdictions while keeping voting accessible for all eligible voters through convenient, accessible polling options and plain-language information in multiple formats. Finally, ongoing civics education and respectful, evidence-based communication\u2014working with schools, libraries, and community groups\u2014can reduce misinformation and help people understand not just what institutions decide, but how and why they do it.",

Trust also depends on equal access and respectful treatment, so services should be convenient for working families and caregivers, accessible for seniors and people with disabilities, and communicated in multiple languages through trusted local partners (schools, libraries, community and faith groups).
