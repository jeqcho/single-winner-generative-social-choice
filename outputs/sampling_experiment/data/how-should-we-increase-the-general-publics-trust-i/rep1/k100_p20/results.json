    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when people can see, verify, and question how decisions are made, and when the rules are applied fairly to everyone. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, privacy-protecting security with clear public accountability: use voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent audit trails), conduct routine independent audits (including risk-limiting audits where feasible), publish plain-language reports and open data about procedures and results, and enforce consistent chain-of-custody and cybersecurity standards. Trust also depends on lived experience, so institutions should invest in accessible service\u2014multilingual and disability-friendly materials, well-trained frontline staff, and responsive local offices that answer questions quickly and transparently when problems occur. Finally, credibility improves when oversight is visibly nonpartisan: bipartisan or multi-stakeholder review boards, clear conflict-of-interest rules, and protected channels for whistleblowers and public observation. The goal is not to demand blind faith, but to make trust earned\u2014through verification, fairness, and respectful engagement with every community.",

We should standardize transparent, nonpartisan procedures: voter-verifiable paper ballots (or auditable records), strict chain-of-custody, routine risk-limiting audits after every election, and public reporting of audit methods and results in plain language. Institutions should also invest in cybersecurity and resilient local operations so disruptions are prevented and addressed quickly without creating new barriers for eligible voters. Finally, ongoing civic education and timely, fact-based communication\u2014delivered in accessible, multilingual formats and supported by bipartisan and community voices\u2014can reduce misinformation, protect privacy and civil liberties, and help all communities see that the process is fair, accountable, and worthy of confidence.",

    "new_statement": "To increase the public\u2019s trust in institutions, we should focus on a few practical commitments that work across political and cultural lines: make decisions transparent, independently verifiable, consistently applied, and communicated in plain language. That means setting clear rules and performance standards; publishing easy-to-navigate public data on outcomes, spending, and service quality; and expanding third-party oversight (independent auditors, bipartisan or cross-community review panels, inspectors general, and public observers) so people don\u2019t have to \u201ctake anyone\u2019s word for it.\u201d Institutions should also protect privacy and civil liberties while strengthening security and reliability\u2014using documented procedures, strong cyber and physical safeguards, and clear accountability when mistakes happen.\n\nTrust also depends on everyday experience. Services must be accessible and fair: multilingual and disability-accessible information, simple processes that don\u2019t burden eligible users, and respectful frontline interactions that treat people consistently regardless of race, neighborhood, or political identity. Finally, institutions should invest in ongoing community engagement\u2014partnering with trusted local leaders, schools, faith groups, and employers\u2014so feedback is continuous, misinformation is addressed with evidence, and the public can see not just what decisions were made, but how and why. When institutions are transparent, independently checked, accountable for errors, and genuinely responsive, trust becomes earned rather than demanded.",
