    "new_statement": "Public trust in elections\u2014and in institutions more broadly\u2014grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify outcomes independently, and feel they are treated fairly regardless of party, background, or where they live. A practical middle ground is to pair strong, visible integrity measures (auditable paper records where feasible, routine independent post-election audits, strict chain-of-custody, and transparent reporting of any errors and fixes) with broad, secure access (reasonable early and absentee options, accessible polling places, and clear accommodations). Institutions should communicate in plain, multilingual language, publish easy-to-use public data and timelines, invite bipartisan and nonpartisan observers, and respond to concerns respectfully with evidence rather than dismissiveness. Finally, investing in local capacity\u2014staffing, cybersecurity, training, and ongoing civic and media literacy\u2014helps reduce misinformation, prevent disruptions, and demonstrate consistent accountability over time.",

    "new_statement": "To increase public trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should combine strong, visible safeguards with clear, nonpartisan communication and broad, fair access. That means using verifiable paper records (or auditable systems), routine independent post-election audits such as risk-limiting audits, strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity protections, and bipartisan/nonpartisan oversight so outcomes can be checked rather than simply taken on faith. Just as important, institutions should publish plain-language, multilingual explanations of how decisions are made and results are verified, with timely public updates and easy-to-use local dashboards that show what happened and why. Finally, invest in civic education, community partnerships, and respectful outreach\u2014including opportunities for credentialed observers and local volunteers\u2014so people can see processes up close, ask questions, and feel confident that rules are applied consistently and that every eligible person can participate without intimidation or unnecessary barriers.",

That means nonpartisan administration, auditable paper-based records, strict chain-of-custody, and routine independent risk-limiting audits, with results and procedures published in plain language and easy-to-check county-level reports. Trust also grows when access is broad and practical: secure early and mail options with clear safeguards, well-run in-person voting with disability and language accommodations, and well-trained local staff supported by strong cybersecurity. Finally, institutions should earn credibility through respectful two-way communication\u2014public observation opportunities, clear channels to report problems without intimidation, and ongoing civics/media literacy education\u2014so concerns are answered with evidence, not politics, and every eligible voter can feel confident their voice is counted.",
