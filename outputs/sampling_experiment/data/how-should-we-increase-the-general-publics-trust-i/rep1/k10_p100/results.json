    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are made by clear rules, checked by independent reviewers, and corrected when mistakes occur. For elections, that means voter-verifiable records (such as paper ballots or equivalent audit trails), routine post-election audits with publicly posted methods and results, strong cybersecurity and chain-of-custody standards, and transparent incident reporting that explains what happened and how it was fixed. It also means making participation practical for all eligible voters\u2014accessible polling places and hours, secure options for people who can\u2019t vote in person, and clear, plain-language information in multiple languages\u2014while applying the rules consistently and protecting privacy. Finally, trust improves when oversight is genuinely nonpartisan: diverse observers, professional election administration, and ongoing community forums where residents can ask questions, review evidence, and hold officials accountable without partisan pressure.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in our institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014grows when rules are clear, the process is easy to observe and verify, and leaders show consistent honesty and accountability.\n\nFirst, make results verifiable: use auditable paper ballots (or voter-verifiable records), enforce strict chain-of-custody and cybersecurity, and conduct routine, independent post-election risk-limiting audits with methods and findings published in plain language.\n\nSecond, make participation practical and fair: keep polling places accessible, expand reasonable early voting and secure mail/absentee options with tracking, provide multilingual and disability-accessible materials, and apply the rules consistently across jurisdictions so people don\u2019t feel the system changes depending on who is in power.\n\nThird, communicate and engage: share step-by-step explanations of how ballots are cast, stored, counted, and certified; report problems and fixes quickly; correct misinformation with calm, evidence-based updates; and invite public observation and local volunteer involvement so trust comes from neighbors seeing the safeguards in action.\n\nWhen institutions pair strong, inspectable safeguards with equal access and straightforward communication, people across political views have more reason to accept outcomes\u2014even when their side loses.",

    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see, understand, and verify that decisions are made fairly\u2014and when everyday experiences with those institutions are respectful, consistent, and accountable. We can rebuild confidence by setting clear rules, publishing plain-language explanations of how decisions are made, and opening processes to independent oversight (including regular audits and public reporting of results and mistakes, plus what was fixed). Institutions should protect privacy and security, enforce strong ethics standards, and apply rules consistently so no group feels favored or ignored.\n\nTrust also depends on access and dignity: information should be easy to find, written simply, and available in the languages people use at home; services should be reachable for working families, rural communities, seniors, and people with disabilities; and staff should be well-trained and responsive. Finally, institutions should engage communities directly\u2014through schools, libraries, local leaders, and public forums\u2014so questions can be answered with evidence instead of rumor, and so residents can participate as observers, volunteers, and partners in continuous improvement.",
