    "new_statement": "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see how decisions are made, verify that rules are followed, and experience fair treatment in practice. Institutions should publish clear standards, disclose data and reasoning in plain language, and invite independent oversight\u2014audits, inspectors general, bipartisan or multi-stakeholder review panels, and transparent reporting of mistakes and corrective actions. Access and dignity matter too: services and participation (from elections to public benefits to policing and health systems) should be easy to navigate, available in multiple languages and formats, and designed so working families, rural residents, and people with disabilities can engage without extra burden. Leaders and staff should be held to consistent ethics rules, conflicts of interest should be minimized and disclosed, and accountability should be real\u2014consequences for misconduct and measurable performance goals for improvement. Finally, institutions should communicate early and honestly, correct misinformation with evidence and receipts, and create regular ways for community members to observe, ask questions, and provide feedback\u2014so trust is earned through transparency, competence, and respect rather than partisan messaging.",

Finally, institutions should invest in accessible participation and communication\u2014early voting and secure mail options where offered, disability accommodations, and multilingual, nonpartisan voter education through schools and trusted community partners\u2014so the public understands the safeguards, can observe or review the evidence, and feels respected regardless of background or political view.",

    "new_statement": "To rebuild the public\u2019s trust in institutions\u2014especially elections\u2014we should focus on simple principles people across backgrounds can verify: clear rules, equal treatment, and evidence that systems work as promised. That means transparent, nonpartisan administration; strong chain-of-custody and cybersecurity; and a voter-verifiable paper record (or equally auditable record) backed by routine, independent post-election audits with results published in plain language. Trust also grows when participation is practical: conveniently located polling places, reasonable hours, secure early and mail options with tracking where used, and accommodations for disability and language needs, including English and Spanish materials. Institutions should communicate early and often with calm, factual updates about what happened, what went wrong (if anything), and how it was fixed\u2014without hiding mistakes or exaggerating them. Finally, long-term confidence depends on accountability and civic education: consistent standards, trained staff, open public observation where appropriate, and ongoing community outreach through schools and local groups so families can understand the process and see that every eligible person is treated fairly.",
