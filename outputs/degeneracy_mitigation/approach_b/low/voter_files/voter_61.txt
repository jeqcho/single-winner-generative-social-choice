Laws on abortion should be guided by a respect for human life, a commitment to personal responsibility, and a practical recognition that complex medical realities rarely fit one-size-fits-all rules. A workable approach protects unborn life where possible while preserving clear exceptions for rape, incest, and serious threats to a mother’s life or long-term health, with decisions grounded in medical expertise rather than political slogans.

A workable framework can protect individual choice early on while setting reasonable limits later, with firm exceptions for rape, incest, and the life and serious health of the mother.
