Cut out as much centralized control and corporate black-box stuff as possible, give states and counties more autonomy within clear rules, and let regular citizens observe every step of the process.

At the same time, election officials should communicate clearly and promptly with the public, explaining procedures and addressing irregularities in plain language.
