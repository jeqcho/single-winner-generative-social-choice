      "Public trust in institutions grows when they consistently deliver results while being transparent about how decisions are made and how mistakes are corrected. We can respect concerns about overreach or bias by strengthening accountability\u2014through independent oversight, clear performance metrics, open data where appropriate, and real consequences for misconduct\u2014while also ensuring institutions have the resources to do their jobs well. At the same time, institutions should deepen engagement with communities, communicate in plain language, and protect fairness and rights so people can see that rules are applied consistently. This balanced approach prioritizes both effective public service and credible checks and balances, giving skeptics reasons to re-engage without dismissing those who rely on institutions every day.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with consistent, reliable delivery of services people can see and measure. Those who emphasize integrity can support independent oversight, open data, and meaningful consequences for wrongdoing, while those who worry about overreach can support clear limits, due process, and regular performance audits. Institutions should also engage communities early, communicate decisions and tradeoffs plainly, and make it easy for people to report problems and see them resolved.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with consistent delivery of services people can see and verify. Those who worry about overreach can be assured by clear limits on power, independent oversight, and open data, while those who want effective government can prioritize competence, fair enforcement, and equitable access. Building trust will require regular two-way communication\u2014listening to communities, admitting mistakes, and showing measurable improvements over time.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with consistent, reliable delivery of services that people can see and measure. This means making decisions and data easier to understand, enforcing clear ethics and oversight, and correcting mistakes openly\u2014while also ensuring institutions have the resources and independence needed to do their jobs well. By inviting meaningful public input and treating communities fairly, we can address skepticism without undermining the essential role institutions play in a functioning society.",
      "Public trust in institutions can grow when they consistently deliver fair, competent results while being transparent about how decisions are made and who benefits. People who want stability and those who want reform can agree on stronger accountability\u2014clear performance standards, independent oversight, and real consequences for misconduct\u2014without undermining institutions\u2019 ability to function. Pairing this with meaningful public engagement and open access to information helps citizens feel heard and reduces suspicion, while protecting essential expertise and the rule of law."
