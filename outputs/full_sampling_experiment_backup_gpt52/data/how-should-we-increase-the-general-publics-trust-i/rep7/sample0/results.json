      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a renewed commitment to delivering reliable, fair services. People who favor reform are right to demand clearer oversight and consequences for failures, while those who worry about undermining essential institutions are right that stability and expertise matter. A practical middle ground is to make decision-making and outcomes more visible, invite meaningful public input, and measure performance against shared standards, so trust is earned through consistent results rather than slogans.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair greater transparency and accountability with a fair recognition of the essential services these institutions provide. That means clearer decision-making, independent oversight, and meaningful consequences for misconduct, alongside investments in competence, ethics, and public-facing communication. By inviting citizens into feedback and participation while protecting institutions from partisan capture, we can rebuild trust through consistent, measurable performance and honest engagement."
