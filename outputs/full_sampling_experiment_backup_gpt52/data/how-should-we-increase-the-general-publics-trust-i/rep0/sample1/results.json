      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to competent, consistent service delivery. People who prioritize stability and expertise can support investments in professional standards and long-term capacity, while those worried about abuse of power can see real checks through independent oversight, clear metrics, and consequences for misconduct. Trust grows when institutions communicate honestly about limits and tradeoffs, invite meaningful public input, and demonstrate reliability through measurable results.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to competent, consistent public service. People who are skeptical deserve clear evidence\u2014open data, independent audits, meaningful consequences for misconduct\u2014while those who value institutional stability need reforms that improve performance without undermining essential functions. Building regular two-way engagement with communities and showing measurable results over time can create trust based on both integrity and effectiveness.",
      "Public trust in institutions grows when people can see that decisions are fair, transparent, and grounded in reliable evidence while still reflecting the lived experiences of the communities affected. We can respect concerns about overreach and elitism by strengthening accountability\u2014independent audits, clear performance metrics, and meaningful consequences for misconduct\u2014without abandoning the expertise needed to handle complex problems. Building durable trust also requires consistent two-way engagement, open data where possible, and practical improvements in service delivery so institutions earn legitimacy through both integrity and results.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with more consistent, effective service delivery that people can see and measure in their daily lives. Those who worry about overreach deserve clear limits, independent oversight, and open data, while those who value stability need well-funded, professional institutions that can respond reliably in crises. Creating regular channels for public input\u2014along with fair enforcement of rules and consequences for misconduct\u2014can help rebuild confidence without undermining institutional capacity.",
      "Building public trust in institutions requires both stronger accountability and a genuine commitment to serving people fairly and effectively. While some emphasize the need for transparency and checks on power, others prioritize stable, competent institutions that can deliver results; we can pursue both by making decision-making more open, measuring performance publicly, and enforcing clear consequences for misconduct. At the same time, institutions should invite meaningful community input and improve everyday service so trust is earned through consistent, real-world experience."
