      "Public trust in institutions can grow when people see both stronger accountability and better everyday performance, without turning reforms into partisan score\u2011settling. We can combine greater transparency (clear metrics, open data where safe, and independent audits) with meaningful public input and consistent enforcement of rules, while still protecting expert judgment in complex decisions. Investing in fair, accessible services and correcting mistakes openly helps show institutions are competent and responsive, giving skeptics reasons to reengage and supporters confidence that trust is being earned.",
      "We can increase public trust in institutions by pairing stronger transparency and accountability with practical improvements in everyday service and outcomes. People who worry about overreach and bias deserve clear rules, independent oversight, and accessible ways to challenge decisions, while those who value institutional stability can support reforms that protect competence and continuity. A shared path is to publish understandable performance data, enforce consequences for misconduct, and involve communities in decision-making so institutions remain both trustworthy and effective.",
      "Increasing public trust in institutions should focus on making them more transparent, accountable, and responsive, while recognizing that skepticism can be both a healthy check and a sign of real past failures. We can build confidence by strengthening oversight, publishing clear performance measures, protecting whistleblowers, and ensuring decisions are explained in plain language with meaningful opportunities for public input. At the same time, institutions should be supported to deliver reliable services consistently, so trust is earned through results rather than demanded through authority.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to stable, effective public service. People who worry about overreach deserve clear limits, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct, while those who value institutional capacity deserve adequate resources and professional standards to deliver results. Across perspectives, trust grows when decisions and data are openly explained, communities have meaningful input, and institutions consistently show they can correct mistakes and serve everyone fairly.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to fair, effective service delivery. People who favor reform are right that clear standards, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct matter, while those wary of constant disruption are right that stable institutions are essential for safety, health, and economic opportunity. A practical consensus is to make decision-making more open, measure performance publicly, and invite regular community input\u2014while protecting institutional independence from partisan swings and ensuring reforms are evaluated for real-world results."
