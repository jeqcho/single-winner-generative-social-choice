At the same time, states should offer accessible options\u2014such as early voting and secure mail ballots with tracking\u2014while using accurate voter-roll maintenance and clear, plain-language (and multilingual) explanations so eligible voters can participate confidently and accept the outcome.",

      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a renewed focus on delivering reliable, everyday results that people can see and measure. Those who worry about overreach can be reassured by clear limits on authority, independent oversight, and open data, while those who emphasize equity and competence can support investments in professional standards, fair access, and responsive services. Trust grows when institutions admit mistakes, explain decisions plainly, and consistently engage communities in shaping policies that affect them.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with reliable capacity to deliver results. That means clear performance metrics, open decision-making where feasible, independent oversight, and real consequences for misconduct\u2014while also recognizing that institutions need stability, due process, and adequate resources to serve the public effectively. By combining measurable service improvements with honest communication and meaningful public input, we can respect skepticism without undermining the essential role institutions play.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair strong accountability with a recognition that these institutions often deliver essential public goods. That means greater transparency, clear performance measures, and independent oversight, while also investing in competent staffing and reliable services people can see and use. By inviting meaningful public participation and communicating decisions honestly\u2014including mistakes and how they\u2019ll be fixed\u2014institutions can earn trust through consistent results rather than rhetoric.",
      "Public trust in institutions can grow when those institutions consistently earn it through transparency, fairness, and measurable results\u2014while also recognizing that skepticism is often rooted in real past failures. A balanced approach is to strengthen independent oversight, clear accountability for mistakes, and open access to information, without undermining institutions\u2019 ability to function and serve the public. Pairing these reforms with regular two-way engagement\u2014especially with communities that feel unheard\u2014can rebuild legitimacy over time and make trust a shared, evidence-based outcome rather than a demand.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger accountability and transparency with a fair recognition of the essential services institutions provide. People who feel institutions have failed them are right to demand clear standards, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct, while those who worry about undermining expertise are right to want stable, capable governance. A practical middle ground is to make decisions and data more open, engage communities in setting priorities, and improve service delivery\u2014so trust is earned through consistent performance and honest communication."
