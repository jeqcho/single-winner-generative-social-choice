      "Increasing public trust in institutions requires both stronger accountability and a fair recognition of the valuable services institutions provide. We can find common ground by improving transparency, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct while also investing in better frontline performance and communication that meets people where they are. Institutions should invite regular public input and share clear evidence of results, so trust is earned through consistent, measurable integrity rather than demanded or dismissed.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair clear accountability and transparency with strong, consistent delivery of essential services. People who are skeptical often want proof and consequences for misconduct, while others worry that constant attacks can weaken institutions\u2019 ability to function; both concerns can be addressed through independent oversight, open data, and fair, timely investigations. Institutions should also engage communities directly\u2014listening to criticism, explaining decisions in plain language, and measuring outcomes publicly\u2014so trust is earned through performance rather than demanded by authority.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with consistent delivery of reliable services and fair treatment. People who worry about overreach deserve clear limits, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct, while those who value institutional stability need the resources and professional standards that make competent governance possible. A practical path forward is to open decision-making and data to public scrutiny, invite meaningful community participation, and measure performance against shared, publicly reported goals.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a renewed commitment to competent, fair service delivery. Those who worry about overreach and inefficiency deserve clear standards, independent oversight, and meaningful consequences for misconduct, while those who value stable institutions deserve adequate resources and protections that let public servants do their jobs well. By making decisions and data easier to scrutinize, inviting public participation, and consistently delivering results, institutions can earn trust through demonstrated performance rather than promises.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger accountability and transparency with a fair recognition of the expertise and public-service role institutions can provide. That means setting clear standards, publishing understandable performance data, protecting independent oversight, and promptly addressing misconduct, while also improving communication and civic education so decisions and tradeoffs are easier to evaluate. At the same time, institutions should create meaningful ways for communities to participate and be heard, so trust is earned through consistent results and responsiveness rather than demanded by authority."
