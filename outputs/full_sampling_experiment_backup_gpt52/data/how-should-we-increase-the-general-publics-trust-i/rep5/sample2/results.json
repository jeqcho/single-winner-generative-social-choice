      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a clear recognition that many institutions also deliver essential services that must remain stable and effective. That means publishing understandable performance data, creating independent oversight and meaningful consequences for misconduct, and involving communities in decision-making\u2014while also protecting due process and avoiding reforms that undermine core capacity. By focusing on measurable integrity, responsiveness, and results, we can address skepticism without dismissing the value institutions provide.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to competent, stable public service. People who worry about corruption and bias deserve clearer oversight, open data, and meaningful consequences for misconduct, while those concerned about undermining essential institutions deserve reforms that preserve expertise and continuity. Practical steps like independent audits, plain-language communication, and regular community input can show results while respecting both skepticism and the need for functioning institutions.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with reliable service delivery that people can see and measure in their daily lives. Those who worry about overreach deserve clear limits, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct, while those who value effective governance deserve adequate resources, professional standards, and long-term stability. A practical middle ground is to make decisions and data more open, involve communities in setting priorities, and regularly audit outcomes\u2014so trust is earned through both openness and performance.",
      "Building public trust in institutions requires pairing stronger accountability with better performance: clear standards, transparent decision-making, and consequences for misconduct, alongside reliable delivery of essential services. People who worry about overreach should see robust checks, open data, and independent oversight, while those who value capacity should see adequate resources and professional competence. Institutions should also engage communities regularly\u2014listening, explaining tradeoffs, and showing measurable results\u2014so trust is earned through both integrity and effectiveness.",

People who worry about overreach deserve strong checks\u2014independent oversight, open data where appropriate, and meaningful consequences for misconduct\u2014while those who rely on institutions need adequate resources and professional standards to make them effective. Building trust will require regular two-way engagement with communities and measurable performance goals so institutions can demonstrate results and correct course when they fall short."
