      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with steady investment in institutions\u2019 capacity to deliver fair, reliable services. People who emphasize reform are right that clear standards, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct matter, while those who worry about cynicism are right that constant suspicion can weaken essential public functions. A practical middle ground is to make decision-making and outcomes easier to scrutinize, invite meaningful public input, and consistently demonstrate results\u2014so trust is earned through openness, competence, and integrity over time.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a clear commitment to effective, reliable service. People who are skeptical want proof that institutions admit mistakes and prevent abuses, while supporters emphasize the need for stable, capable organizations that can solve problems. A practical middle ground is to expand independent oversight, publish understandable performance and spending data, and create meaningful channels for public input, while also protecting institutions from politicization so they can consistently deliver fair outcomes.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to effective, reliable services that improve people\u2019s daily lives. Those who worry about overreach deserve clear checks and independent oversight, while those who value capable governance need institutions that can act decisively and competently. A shared path forward is to make decisions and data more open, enforce consequences for misconduct, and create meaningful channels for public input\u2014so trust is earned through consistent performance and integrity rather than demanded.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair greater transparency and accountability with consistent delivery of competent, fair services. People who worry about overreach deserve clear limits, independent oversight, and meaningful avenues to challenge decisions, while those who fear underinvestment need institutions that are adequately resourced to perform reliably. Building trust requires measurable standards, open data where feasible, and regular public engagement so institutions earn confidence through both results and integrity.",
      "Public trust in institutions can be strengthened by pairing clear, consistent standards of integrity with genuine responsiveness to people\u2019s lived experiences. That means increasing transparency, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct, while also improving everyday service delivery and making decisions more participatory and easier to understand. At the same time, institutions should communicate uncertainties honestly and invest in civic education and open data so trust is earned through verifiable performance rather than demanded by authority."
