      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with better delivery of essential services. People who emphasize integrity can be reassured by clear standards, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct, while those focused on effectiveness can see measurable goals, regular public reporting, and opportunities to improve. By making decisions understandable, inviting meaningful public input, and demonstrating consistent results, institutions can earn trust without demanding it.",
      "Public trust in institutions can be strengthened by pairing higher transparency and accountability with reliable service delivery that people can see and measure in their daily lives. While some prioritize limiting institutional power and others emphasize preserving stability and expertise, both sides can agree on clear standards, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct. Institutions should also engage communities through open data, accessible communication, and meaningful public input, while protecting due process and resisting misinformation. The goal is not blind faith, but earned confidence built through consistent performance, fair treatment, and openness to reform.",
      "Building public trust in institutions requires both stronger integrity and more meaningful engagement with the people they serve. We can agree that institutions should be transparent about decisions and mistakes, enforce clear accountability, and show measurable results, while also listening respectfully to skepticism and lived experience. At the same time, the public benefits from accessible information and fair processes that encourage participation rather than polarization. A balanced approach pairs reforms that reduce conflicts of interest and improve service delivery with open communication that treats trust as something earned, not demanded.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair greater transparency and accountability with a commitment to effective, consistent service that improves people\u2019s daily lives. Those who are skeptical deserve clear information, independent oversight, and real consequences for misconduct; those who value stability deserve reforms that strengthen performance rather than simply dismantle systems. Building trust requires ongoing two-way engagement\u2014listening to communities, protecting rights, and showing measurable results over time.",
      "Public trust in institutions can be strengthened by pairing higher transparency and accountability with reliable, effective service delivery that improves people\u2019s everyday lives. Institutions should share clear data and decision rationales, admit mistakes, and enforce consequences for misconduct, while also protecting independence from partisan pressure and ensuring due process. Creating meaningful channels for public input\u2014especially from communities that feel overlooked\u2014can make policies more responsive without sacrificing expertise and long-term stability."
