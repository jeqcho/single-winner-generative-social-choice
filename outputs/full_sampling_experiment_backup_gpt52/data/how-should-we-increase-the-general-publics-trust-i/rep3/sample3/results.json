      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a fair recognition of the essential services institutions provide. That means clear standards, independent oversight, and open data where possible, alongside consistent communication that explains decisions, tradeoffs, and results in plain language. Trust can grow when institutions invite meaningful public participation, correct mistakes visibly, and treat people equitably\u2014without undermining professional expertise or the stability needed to serve the common good.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with practical improvements in service and outcomes that people can see in their daily lives. This means clear reporting of decisions and results, independent oversight, and meaningful opportunities for public input\u2014while also ensuring institutions have the resources and expertise to function effectively. By setting measurable standards, admitting and correcting mistakes, and treating communities fairly and consistently, institutions can earn trust without demanding it.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with clear, consistent delivery of reliable services. People who worry about corruption and bias deserve meaningful oversight, open data, and consequences for misconduct, while those concerned about eroding confidence should see institutions communicate honestly, admit mistakes, and improve performance. A practical middle ground is to set measurable standards, invite independent auditing and community input, and report progress regularly so trust is earned through demonstrable results rather than assumed.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with consistent delivery of effective, fair services. Those who worry about overreach deserve clear limits, independent oversight, and accessible channels for appeal, while those who value institutional capacity deserve stable funding and professional standards that prevent politicization. Building trust means inviting meaningful public input, openly reporting results and mistakes, and enforcing consequences for misconduct\u2014so institutions earn legitimacy through performance and integrity.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair strong accountability and transparency with a commitment to competent, consistent delivery of essential services. People who favor reform are right to demand clearer oversight, independent audits, and consequences for misconduct, while those who value stability are right that institutions must remain effective and insulated from short-term political pressure. A practical consensus is to make decision-making and data more open, invite meaningful public participation, and measure performance against clear standards\u2014so trust is earned through both integrity and results."
