      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with reliable, high-quality services that people can see and feel in their daily lives. Those who worry about overreach deserve clearer oversight, independent audits, and meaningful consequences for misconduct, while those who value capable institutions deserve stable funding and protections that let professionals do their jobs without politicized interference. Across perspectives, trust grows when decisions are explained in plain language, communities are included early, and results are measured and publicly reported.",
      "Public trust in institutions can grow when they are both effective and accountable: delivering reliable services while being transparent about decisions, data, and mistakes. People who favor reform and those who defend institutional expertise can agree on clear standards, independent oversight, and meaningful public input that improves performance without politicizing core functions. Strengthening ethics rules, auditing outcomes, and communicating honestly\u2014especially in crises\u2014can create a feedback loop where institutions earn trust through measurable results and respectful engagement.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to stable, effective public service. That means making decisions and data easier to scrutinize, enforcing clear standards for ethics and performance, and creating meaningful channels for community input, while also protecting institutions from partisan swings so they can deliver reliably. People may disagree on how much reform is needed, but most can agree that trust grows when institutions consistently explain what they\u2019re doing, admit and correct mistakes, and produce results that people can see in their daily lives.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with better support for the people and systems that deliver essential services. Those who worry about corruption and abuse of power deserve clear oversight, open data, and consequences for wrongdoing, while those concerned about instability and cynicism deserve institutions that can act effectively and fairly. A practical middle ground is to invest in service quality and civic engagement while adopting measurable standards, independent audits, and accessible channels for feedback and redress.",
      "Increasing public trust in institutions should focus on making them more transparent, accountable, and responsive, while recognizing that skepticism can be both a healthy check on power and a sign of real past failures. Institutions can earn trust by clearly explaining decisions, openly sharing data and results, and creating independent oversight with meaningful consequences for misconduct. At the same time, the public and media can support trust by engaging with evidence, distinguishing mistakes from malice, and participating in constructive feedback channels that improve performance over time."
