      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to fair, effective service delivery. People who emphasize reform are right that clear standards, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct matter, while those concerned about stability are right that institutions need resources and consistent rules to perform reliably. Building trust requires regular public reporting, meaningful community input, and measurable improvements that show institutions are both answerable to the public and capable of achieving their missions.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to competent, consistent delivery of core services. This means openly sharing data and decisions, admitting and correcting mistakes, and enforcing clear standards for ethics and performance, while also protecting institutions from undue partisan influence. At the same time, creating regular, meaningful channels for public input\u2014especially from communities that feel overlooked\u2014can ensure reforms respond to real concerns and build trust through lived experience.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and independent oversight with a clear focus on delivering reliable, fair services that people can see and measure. Those who worry about corruption or capture deserve enforceable accountability, while those who value stability and expertise deserve institutions that can operate effectively without constant political interference. Building trust requires consistent communication, meaningful public input, and consequences when standards aren\u2019t met, so confidence is earned through both openness and performance.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a demonstrated commitment to competent, consistent service. Those who emphasize integrity can be met with clearer oversight, open data, and meaningful consequences for misconduct, while those who value stability can be assured through predictable rules, professional standards, and long-term capacity building. Across perspectives, trust grows when institutions listen to communities, explain decisions plainly, and show measurable improvements over time.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with consistent, high-quality service that people can see and verify in their daily lives. This means setting clear standards, openly sharing data and decisions, and enforcing consequences for misconduct, while also recognizing that institutions need enough independence and resources to function effectively. By combining meaningful oversight, public participation, and measurable improvements in outcomes, we can address legitimate skepticism without undermining the stability and expertise that institutions provide."
