      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with better delivery of essential services, so people can see both honest decision-making and real results. Those who worry about overreach deserve clear checks\u2014independent oversight, open data, and consequences for misconduct\u2014while those who emphasize stability can support reforms that strengthen competence rather than weaken institutions. Trust grows when institutions regularly explain their choices, invite meaningful public input, and demonstrate fair, consistent treatment for everyone.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to competent, consistent service delivery. People who worry about overreach deserve clear limits, independent oversight, and open data, while those who value effective governance need institutions that are properly resourced and staffed. A practical middle ground is to make decisions and outcomes easier to understand and verify, invite meaningful public input, and enforce real consequences for misconduct\u2014so trust is earned through performance rather than assumed.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to fair, effective service delivery. That means clear standards for performance and ethics, independent oversight, and consequences for misconduct, while also ensuring institutions have the resources and stability to do their jobs well. At the same time, regular two-way engagement\u2014listening to community concerns, explaining decisions and tradeoffs, and showing measurable results\u2014can rebuild confidence without dismissing skepticism or undermining legitimate expertise.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to fair, consistent service for everyone. This means making decisions and data easier to understand, enforcing meaningful consequences for misconduct, and creating regular channels for public input without turning every issue into a partisan fight. At the same time, institutions need stable resources and professional standards so they can deliver results reliably, because trust grows when people see both integrity and competence in practice.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with fair recognition of the complex work institutions do. That means clear standards, independent oversight, and open access to information where possible, while also investing in consistent service delivery and respectful, responsive communication with the public. By listening to communities, measuring outcomes, and correcting mistakes openly, institutions can earn trust without demanding it and rebuild confidence across different viewpoints."
