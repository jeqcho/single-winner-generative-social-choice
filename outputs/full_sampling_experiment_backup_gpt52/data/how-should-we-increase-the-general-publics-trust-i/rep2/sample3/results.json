      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a clear commitment to effective service and fair outcomes. People who emphasize institutional expertise and stability can support reforms that make decisions, data, and funding easier to scrutinize, while those who are skeptical can be met with independent oversight, meaningful consequences for misconduct, and simpler ways to appeal or correct errors. Building trust also requires consistent engagement with communities and honest communication about tradeoffs, so institutions can demonstrate reliability over time rather than demand confidence upfront.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with consistent, high-quality services that people can directly experience. This means clearer communication about decisions and data, meaningful independent oversight, and real consequences for misconduct, while also ensuring institutions have the resources and expertise to do their jobs well. By inviting public input, protecting fair process, and measuring outcomes openly, we can rebuild confidence without assuming either blind trust or blanket distrust.",
      "Public trust in institutions can grow when they consistently deliver competent results while being transparent about decisions, mistakes, and limits. People who value stability and expertise and those who worry about accountability can agree on stronger oversight: clear performance metrics, independent audits, open data where feasible, and meaningful consequences for misconduct. At the same time, institutions should improve two-way engagement\u2014listening to communities, explaining tradeoffs in plain language, and protecting impartial rules\u2014so trust is earned through both reliability and responsiveness.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair greater transparency and accountability with a commitment to competent, reliable service delivery. People who emphasize reform need clear oversight, accessible data, and meaningful consequences for misconduct, while those who value stability and expertise need protections that let institutions operate effectively without politicized interference. A practical middle ground is to strengthen independent audits, open communication, and community input, while investing in staff capacity and consistent standards so institutions earn trust through both integrity and performance.",
      "Increasing public trust in institutions requires pairing strong accountability with real-world effectiveness. Institutions should be transparent about decisions, data, and mistakes, invite meaningful public participation, and enforce clear standards that apply to everyone, while also delivering reliable services and fair treatment across communities. This approach respects skepticism about concentrated power and, at the same time, supports the shared need for competent institutions that people can depend on."
