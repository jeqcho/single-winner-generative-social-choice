      "Public trust in institutions grows when they are both effective and accountable: delivering reliable services while being transparent about decisions, data, and mistakes. We can respect concerns about overreach by strengthening independent oversight, clear ethical standards, and meaningful avenues for public input, without undermining the capacity to act in emergencies or provide essential programs. Pairing openness with measurable performance\u2014regular audits, accessible reporting, and consequences for misconduct\u2014offers a practical middle path that addresses skepticism while reinforcing legitimacy.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a clear commitment to effective service delivery and fairness. People who worry about overreach deserve real checks\u2014independent oversight, open data, and consequences for misconduct\u2014while those who rely on institutions need them adequately resourced and staffed to perform well. Building trust is less about messaging and more about consistent, measurable improvements, respectful engagement with communities, and equal treatment under the rules.",
      "Public trust in institutions grows when they consistently deliver results and can clearly show how decisions are made and how mistakes are corrected. We can balance calls for accountability and reform with the need for stability by strengthening transparency, independent oversight, and fair, predictable rules that apply to everyone. At the same time, institutions should communicate more plainly, engage communities in decision-making, and protect professional expertise from partisan pressure while remaining responsive to legitimate public concerns.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair stronger transparency and accountability with a commitment to effective, reliable service. People who are skeptical often want clearer evidence that rules are fair and that mistakes have consequences, while others worry that constant distrust can undermine essential public functions; both concerns point toward open data, independent oversight, and protections against corruption without weakening capacity. Building trust also requires ongoing two-way communication and community participation so institutions can reflect real needs and demonstrate results over time.",
      "Trust in institutions can be strengthened by pairing strong performance with openness: delivering reliable services and fair outcomes while making decisions, data, and mistakes transparent and easy to scrutinize. People who worry about overreach deserve clear limits, independent oversight, and real consequences for misconduct, while those who value effective governance need institutions that are well-resourced and able to act. Building sustained channels for public input\u2014alongside consistent, equal enforcement of rules\u2014can create accountability without sacrificing competence."
