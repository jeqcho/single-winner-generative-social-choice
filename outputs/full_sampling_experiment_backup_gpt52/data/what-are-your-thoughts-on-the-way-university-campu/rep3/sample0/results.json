      "University campuses should protect robust free expression because open debate is central to learning, while also recognizing that speech can sometimes undermine students\u2019 ability to participate safely and fully. A reasonable approach is to apply clear, viewpoint-neutral rules that allow controversial ideas but prohibit targeted harassment, true threats, and unlawful discrimination, with transparent processes and consistent enforcement. Campuses can further support both goals by promoting counterspeech, civil dialogue, and educational programming rather than relying on ad hoc bans or punitive measures.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression as a core academic value while also setting clear, content-neutral rules that keep learning environments safe and functional. It\u2019s reasonable to allow even unpopular or controversial speech, but universities should also take concerns about harassment, credible threats, and persistent disruption seriously and respond consistently. A fair approach is transparent policies, viewpoint-neutral enforcement, and more opportunities for dialogue and education so disagreements can be addressed without resorting to censorship or intimidation.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression as a core academic value while also maintaining clear, viewpoint-neutral rules that keep learning environments safe and functional. It\u2019s reasonable to allow strong disagreement and controversial speakers, but also to set consistent limits on harassment, credible threats, and disruptive conduct that prevents others from participating. A fair approach combines transparent policies, due process, and proactive support for open debate\u2014so students can speak, listen, and challenge ideas without fear or intimidation.",
      "University campuses should be places where a wide range of ideas can be expressed and debated, because open inquiry is central to education. At the same time, schools have a responsibility to maintain safety and an environment where students can learn without targeted harassment or intimidation. A fair approach is to protect lawful, nonviolent speech as broadly as possible while enforcing clear, viewpoint-neutral rules on time, place, and manner\u2014and responding to harmful conduct with due process rather than censorship.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression as central to learning, while also maintaining clear, content-neutral rules that prevent harassment, true threats, and disruption of others\u2019 ability to study and speak. It\u2019s reasonable to worry both about censorship and about environments becoming hostile or unsafe, so policies should be transparent, consistently enforced, and paired with support for respectful dialogue and constructive protest. A good middle ground is maximizing viewpoint diversity and open debate, while setting fair boundaries that safeguard people\u2019s rights and the university\u2019s educational mission."
