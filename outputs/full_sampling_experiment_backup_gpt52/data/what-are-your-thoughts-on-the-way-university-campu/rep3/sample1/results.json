      "University campuses should protect robust free expression because open inquiry is central to education, while also maintaining clear, content-neutral rules that keep learning spaces safe and functional. It\u2019s reasonable to distinguish between unpopular ideas\u2014which should be heard and debated\u2014and conduct like targeted harassment, credible threats, or persistent disruption, which the university can restrict. The best approach pairs viewpoint-neutral enforcement with transparent procedures and more opportunities for dialogue, so disagreements are addressed through argument and evidence rather than censorship or intimidation.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression as central to learning, while also ensuring that students can participate without being subjected to targeted harassment, threats, or disruption. People differ on where to draw the line, but most agree that rules should be viewpoint-neutral, transparent, and applied consistently, with clear processes for resolving disputes. In practice, campuses can uphold both safety and open inquiry by encouraging more speech\u2014debate, education, and support\u2014while reserving sanctions for conduct that materially interferes with others\u2019 rights or violates the law.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression as a core academic value while also maintaining clear, content-neutral rules that keep people safe and allow learning to continue. It\u2019s reasonable to be concerned both about censorship and about harassment or disruption, so policies should distinguish between speech that is merely unpopular and conduct that materially interferes with others\u2019 rights or access to education. The best approach is transparent, consistently enforced standards paired with opportunities for dialogue and due process when conflicts arise.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression as central to learning, while also recognizing their duty to maintain safety and ensure all students can participate without harassment or intimidation. A reasonable approach is to allow even unpopular viewpoints but enforce clear, content-neutral rules about time, place, and manner, and intervene only when speech crosses into credible threats, targeted harassment, or unlawful conduct. Campuses can reduce conflict by applying policies consistently and by pairing open debate with support for those affected, so that both academic freedom and an inclusive educational environment are upheld.",
      "University campuses should be places where a wide range of ideas can be expressed and debated openly, because intellectual growth depends on exposure to viewpoints we may disagree with. At the same time, schools have a responsibility to maintain a learning environment that is safe and accessible, so time-place-manner rules and clear standards against targeted harassment can be appropriate when applied consistently and transparently. A balanced approach protects lawful expression while encouraging dialogue, due process, and education over punishment whenever possible."
