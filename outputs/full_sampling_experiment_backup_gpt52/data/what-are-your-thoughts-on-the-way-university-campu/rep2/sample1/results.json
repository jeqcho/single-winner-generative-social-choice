At the same time, administrators should invest in constructive outlets like facilitated dialogues, teach-ins, and support services so disagreement can be expressed without turning into fear or silence.",

      "University campuses should be places where a wide range of ideas can be expressed and debated openly, while also maintaining clear standards that prevent harassment, threats, or disruption of others\u2019 ability to learn. It\u2019s reasonable to worry both about censorship and about creating an inclusive environment, so policies should be transparent, applied consistently, and focused on behavior rather than viewpoint. When disputes arise, schools can prioritize dialogue\u2014through structured debate, clear protest guidelines, and fair processes\u2014so free inquiry and community safety reinforce rather than undermine each other.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression as a core academic value while maintaining clear, viewpoint-neutral rules that prevent harassment, credible threats, and disruption of others\u2019 ability to learn. People reasonably disagree on where to draw lines, so policies should be transparent, consistently applied, and paired with due process and opportunities for dialogue. A practical middle ground is to allow controversial ideas to be heard and challenged, while ensuring campus safety and equal access through narrowly tailored, evidence-based limits.",
      "University campuses should uphold broad free speech protections as a core academic value while also maintaining clear, viewpoint-neutral rules that keep learning environments safe and functional. It\u2019s reasonable to allow controversial ideas to be heard and debated, but also to set consistent limits on harassment, credible threats, and disruptions that prevent others from participating. A balanced approach emphasizes transparency, due process, and more dialogue\u2014through counterspeech and education\u2014rather than ad hoc punishments or blanket bans.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression because open debate is central to learning, while also recognizing that targeted harassment and credible threats can undermine equal access to education. A reasonable approach is to uphold viewpoint-neutral rules that encourage civil dialogue and allow peaceful protest, but set clear, narrowly tailored limits on conduct that disrupts classes or endangers others. With transparent policies and consistent enforcement, campuses can support both intellectual freedom and a respectful, inclusive environment.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression as a core educational value while also maintaining clear, content-neutral rules that keep people safe and ensure learning can continue. It\u2019s reasonable to allow controversial speakers and protest, but also to set consistent limits on harassment, true threats, and persistent disruption that prevents others from participating. The goal should be transparent, evenly applied policies that encourage open debate and mutual respect, rather than shielding ideas from criticism or letting speech become a cover for intimidation."
