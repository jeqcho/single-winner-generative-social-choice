Alongside enforcement, campuses should proactively support affected students and create structured opportunities\u2014moderated forums, teach-ins, and conflict mediation\u2014so disagreement can be expressed with rigor and humanity rather than fear.",

      "University campuses should protect robust free expression because open debate is essential to learning, while also recognizing that speech can sometimes be used to harass, intimidate, or shut others out. A balanced approach is to uphold viewpoint-neutral policies that allow even unpopular ideas to be heard, paired with clear rules against targeted threats and disruption and with fair, transparent procedures for resolving disputes. That way, campuses can remain places where students can challenge one another\u2019s ideas without compromising safety, dignity, or the ability of others to participate.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression as a core academic value while also maintaining clear, content-neutral rules that keep people safe and ensure teaching and research can continue. It\u2019s reasonable to recognize that some speech can feel harmful or intimidating, but restricting ideas too broadly can undermine learning and trust in the institution\u2019s fairness. A workable middle ground is transparent policies, consistent enforcement, and more support for dialogue and counter-speech\u2014so controversial views can be challenged without resorting to censorship or disruption.",
      "University campuses should protect free expression as a core academic value while also maintaining clear, fair rules that prevent harassment, threats, and disruption of others\u2019 ability to learn. It\u2019s reasonable to expect robust debate\u2014including unpopular ideas\u2014and also to recognize that some speech can create real harm or undermine an inclusive environment. A consensus approach is to apply content-neutral policies consistently, provide transparent processes for handling complaints, and invest in dialogue and education that help communities disagree without dehumanizing one another.",
      "University campuses should be places where people can explore and challenge ideas, including unpopular ones, while also maintaining a learning environment where students feel safe to participate. A reasonable approach is to protect broad free expression and viewpoint diversity, but set clear, narrowly tailored limits on conduct that disrupts teaching, targets individuals with harassment, or incites violence. With transparent rules applied consistently and fair processes for addressing disputes, campuses can uphold free speech while respecting community well-being.",
      "University campuses should remain places where a wide range of ideas can be expressed and debated, while also taking seriously their responsibility to maintain a safe, nondisruptive learning environment. That means protecting lawful speech\u2014even when it is unpopular\u2014while setting clear, viewpoint-neutral rules against harassment, true threats, and actions that materially disrupt classes or events. With transparent procedures and consistent enforcement, campuses can encourage open inquiry and provide support for those affected by harmful speech without turning disagreement into censorship."
