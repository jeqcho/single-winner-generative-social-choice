When tensions rise, administrators should pair firm, neutral enforcement with real opportunities for learning\u2014transparent communication, facilitated dialogue, and support resources\u2014so students can speak, listen, and study without fear.",

      "University campuses should be places where a wide range of ideas can be explored and debated, including unpopular ones, while still maintaining a learning environment where students can participate without intimidation or harassment. That means setting viewpoint-neutral rules focused on conduct, safety, and disruption\u2014not on silencing particular opinions\u2014and applying them transparently and consistently. Campuses can support both free expression and student well-being by pairing open debate with clear protections against targeted threats, robust opportunities for dialogue, and fair processes when conflicts arise.",
      "University campuses should protect broad free expression because open debate is central to learning, while also enforcing clear, content-neutral rules that prevent harassment, true threats, and disruptions that stop others from participating. It\u2019s reasonable for students and faculty to worry both about censorship and about speech that can make people feel unsafe or shut out, so policies should focus on conduct and access rather than viewpoints. Transparent standards, consistent enforcement, and strong support for respectful dialogue and due process can help campuses uphold both academic freedom and an inclusive environment.",
      "Universities should be places where a wide range of ideas can be expressed and debated, including unpopular ones, while maintaining clear, viewpoint-neutral rules that protect safety and prevent targeted harassment. It\u2019s reasonable to expect campuses to support robust speech and academic freedom, and also to provide fair processes for addressing genuine harm, disruption, or threats. A balanced approach emphasizes open inquiry, transparent standards, and consistent enforcement so that both speakers and affected community members can trust the system.",
      "University campuses should protect broad free expression as a core part of academic inquiry, while also setting clear, content-neutral rules that keep events safe and ensure learning can continue without disruption. It\u2019s reasonable to worry both about chilling speech through overly restrictive policies and about real harms from harassment or credible threats, so definitions and enforcement should be transparent, consistent, and open to appeal. A good approach is to promote more speech\u2014debate, counterspeech, and education\u2014whenever possible, reserving discipline for conduct that targets individuals with harassment, incites violence, or materially interferes with others\u2019 access to campus life.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free speech as a core academic value while also setting clear, content-neutral rules that keep learning and safety intact. It\u2019s reasonable to allow controversial ideas to be heard, but also to enforce policies against targeted harassment, credible threats, and repeated disruption of others\u2019 ability to participate. A practical middle ground is more transparency and due process in how events are managed, alongside investments in dialogue, education, and support so disagreement can be handled constructively rather than suppressed."
