      "University campuses should strongly protect free expression while recognizing that they also have a duty to keep students safe and able to learn. A workable middle ground is to uphold viewpoint-neutral rules\u2014allowing even unpopular ideas\u2014while setting clear, consistently enforced limits on harassment, true threats, and serious disruption. Schools can pair these protections with support for affected students and robust opportunities for dialogue, so disagreement is addressed through engagement rather than censorship or intimidation.",
      "University campuses should protect broad free expression as a core academic value while also setting clear, content-neutral rules that prevent harassment, threats, and disruption of others\u2019 ability to learn. It\u2019s reasonable to worry both about censorship that chills debate and about speech that can marginalize or intimidate students, so policies should be transparent, consistently enforced, and paired with strong support for open dialogue. A balanced approach encourages robust disagreement and inquiry, while ensuring safety and equal access to education for everyone.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression and open inquiry while also enforcing clear, content-neutral rules that keep students safe and ensure teaching and research can continue. It\u2019s reasonable to worry both about ideas being suppressed and about harassment or disruption being excused as \u201cspeech,\u201d so policies should distinguish offensive viewpoints (which are generally protected) from targeted threats, intimidation, and persistent disruption (which are not). The most credible approach is transparent, consistently applied standards paired with strong support for dialogue, due process, and opportunities to respond with more speech rather than censorship.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression because open debate is essential to learning, while also recognizing that speech can sometimes create real harm or disrupt others\u2019 ability to participate. A reasonable approach is to allow even unpopular viewpoints within clear, content-neutral limits on harassment, true threats, and significant disruption, applied transparently and consistently. Campuses can pair these rules with more dialogue, education, and support systems so disagreements are addressed through engagement rather than blanket bans or intimidation.",
      "University campuses should be places where a wide range of ideas can be expressed and debated, because open inquiry is central to higher education. At the same time, universities have a responsibility to maintain a safe, non-disruptive learning environment, so they can set viewpoint-neutral rules around time, place, and manner and respond to genuine threats or harassment. A fair approach protects controversial speech from being shut down simply for being unpopular, while also ensuring students and faculty can participate without intimidation and have constructive opportunities for dialogue."
