      "University campuses should protect robust free expression because open inquiry is central to learning, while also maintaining clear, narrowly tailored rules that prevent targeted harassment, credible threats, and persistent disruption of others\u2019 ability to study and participate. It\u2019s reasonable to expect institutions to apply these standards consistently and transparently, regardless of viewpoint, and to use dialogue, education, and proportionate discipline before resorting to punitive measures. In that balance\u2014strong speech protections paired with fair processes and a commitment to safety and inclusion\u2014most people can recognize both the value of dissent and the need for a functional academic community.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression because open debate is central to learning, while also maintaining clear, content-neutral rules that prevent genuine harassment, threats, and disruption of others\u2019 ability to study and participate. People reasonably disagree about where to draw lines, so policies should be transparent, applied consistently, and paired with strong support for dialogue and due process. This approach defends academic freedom and viewpoint diversity without dismissing students\u2019 concerns about safety, dignity, and equal access to education.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free expression as essential to learning, while recognizing that speech can sometimes create real harms or disrupt others\u2019 ability to participate. A reasonable approach is to uphold viewpoint-neutral rules that allow even unpopular ideas to be heard, paired with clear, narrowly tailored limits on true threats, harassment, and substantial disruption, and strong support for counter-speech and open debate. With transparent policies, consistent enforcement, and opportunities for dialogue, campuses can defend both intellectual freedom and a safe, inclusive academic environment.",
      "University campuses should protect robust free speech and open debate as core to learning, while also maintaining clear, viewpoint-neutral rules that prevent harassment, credible threats, and disruption of others\u2019 ability to study. It\u2019s reasonable to expect administrators to defend unpopular expression, but also to provide fair processes, consistent enforcement, and support for students who feel targeted. A good middle path is maximizing space for lawful, peaceful expression and dialogue, and addressing harm through transparent standards and education rather than ad hoc censorship.",
      "University campuses should protect broad freedom of expression as essential to learning, while also maintaining reasonable, content-neutral rules that keep classes and events safe and accessible. It\u2019s fair to worry both about censorship that chills debate and about harassment or disruption that prevents others from participating. A workable approach is to allow even unpopular viewpoints to be heard, respond with more speech and open inquiry, and intervene only when conduct crosses clear, consistently applied boundaries such as threats, targeted harassment, or sustained disruption."
