      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical support from public agencies and businesses. Clear rules and fair, consistent enforcement can deter repeat offenses, while convenient bins, regular collection, and well-designed public spaces make it easy for people to do the right thing. Education and community-led cleanups can build shared norms without relying solely on punishment, and targeted investments can focus on high-traffic areas where the impact is greatest.",

We can agree on pairing clear, consistently enforced penalties with convenient disposal options\u2014more bins, regular collection, and well-designed recycling\u2014so compliance is realistic, not just demanded. Education and community clean-up efforts can reinforce shared norms, while targeted enforcement and investments focus on high-traffic problem areas to keep costs fair and results measurable.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine personal responsibility with practical support from public agencies and businesses. This can include clear rules and proportionate enforcement alongside convenient, well-maintained bins, regular cleanups, and public education that makes proper disposal easy and socially expected. By pairing incentives and community engagement with targeted penalties for repeat or egregious violations, communities can reduce litter without relying solely on punishment or solely on messaging.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering in public spaces should combine practical infrastructure\u2014like plentiful, well-placed bins and regular cleaning\u2014with education that builds shared norms of responsibility. For those who prioritize accountability, fair and consistently enforced penalties can deter repeat offenses, while others may prefer positive incentives and community-led cleanups that encourage voluntary compliance. By pairing convenience, public engagement, and proportionate enforcement, cities can reduce litter without over-relying on any single strategy.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine convenient disposal options and public education with fair, consistently enforced penalties, recognizing that behavior change and accountability both matter. Investing in well-placed bins, regular maintenance, and community cleanup programs can make it easier to do the right thing, while targeted fines for repeat or high-impact offenders discourage abuse. This mix supports personal responsibility without ignoring the practical barriers and shared benefits of cleaner public spaces."
