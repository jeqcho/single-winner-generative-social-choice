      "The most effective anti-littering approach balances shared responsibility with fair enforcement: make proper disposal easy through plentiful bins, regular pickup, and clear signage, while pairing these steps with targeted fines for repeated or deliberate offenders. People who emphasize personal accountability and those who prioritize systemic design can agree that education, community cleanups, and behavior-focused nudges reduce litter without over-policing. By measuring results and adjusting resources to hotspots, communities can keep public spaces clean in a practical, cost-aware, and equitable way.",
      "The most effective anti-littering policies combine fair enforcement with practical support, recognizing that clean public spaces are a shared responsibility. Reasonable fines and targeted enforcement can deter chronic offenders, while plentiful bins, reliable collection, and clear signage make it easy for most people to do the right thing. Pairing these measures with education and community-led cleanup programs can build lasting norms without relying solely on punishment.",
      "Effective anti-litter policies should balance personal responsibility with practical infrastructure: make proper disposal easy through plentiful, well-maintained bins, clear signage, and regular cleaning. At the same time, communities can support fair enforcement\u2014such as warnings or modest fines for repeat offenses\u2014paired with education and positive incentives like deposit-return programs and adopt-a-spot efforts. This middle-ground approach respects concerns about over-policing and cost while still holding people accountable and keeping public spaces clean.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine convenient infrastructure (more bins, recycling options, and regular collection) with clear expectations through education and visible signage. For those who prioritize personal responsibility, fair and consistent enforcement\u2014such as modest fines\u2014can deter repeat offenders, while those focused on equity and practicality can support targeted investments in high-traffic areas and community-led cleanups. By pairing prevention, shared civic norms, and proportionate accountability, communities can reduce litter without relying on any single strategy.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine practical infrastructure\u2014like ample, well-placed bins and regular maintenance\u2014with fair, consistent enforcement for repeat or deliberate offenders. At the same time, education campaigns and community clean-up partnerships can build shared norms without treating everyone as a potential violator. By pairing convenience, accountability, and public engagement, communities can reduce litter while respecting budget limits and individual freedoms."
