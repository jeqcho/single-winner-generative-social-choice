      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical support from public agencies. Reasonable enforcement and fines can deter repeat offenders, but they should be paired with convenient bins, regular collection, and clear signage so people can comply easily. Education and community-led cleanups help build shared norms, while targeted measures in high-traffic areas keep costs manageable and results measurable.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical supports, pairing fair enforcement with convenient ways to dispose of waste. Many people favor education and community pride initiatives, while others emphasize deterrence; a consensus approach can combine clear rules and proportionate fines with ample bins, regular maintenance, and targeted outreach in high-traffic areas. Investing in shared infrastructure and consistent enforcement reduces cleanup costs and keeps public spaces welcoming without relying on punishment alone.",

Many people favor education and community pride campaigns, while others emphasize deterrence; a consensus approach can pair targeted fines for repeat offenders with warnings and outreach for first-time violations. Investing in prevention\u2014like adequate waste infrastructure, recycling options, and partnerships with businesses and event organizers\u2014can reduce litter without over-policing and keep public spaces clean for everyone.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, combining fair enforcement with convenient disposal options and public education. While some prioritize strict fines to deter bad behavior and others emphasize investment in infrastructure, most people agree that clear rules, adequate bins, and regular cleaning reduce litter and improve shared spaces. A consensus approach would pair modest, consistently applied penalties with well-maintained waste and recycling access, targeted outreach, and community partnerships to address the root causes of littering.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility and practical support. Communities can pair fair, consistently enforced penalties for repeat offenders with positive measures like abundant bins, clear signage, convenient recycling options, and well-funded cleanup services. Education and community-led campaigns can reinforce shared norms without over-policing, while data-driven reviews ensure policies stay effective and equitable."
