      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical supports, combining fair enforcement (such as targeted fines for repeat or high-impact violations) with education and community engagement. At the same time, governments and businesses should make proper disposal easy by providing well-maintained bins, recycling options, and regular street cleaning, especially in high-traffic areas. This blended approach respects concerns about over-policing while still protecting public health, local environments, and shared spaces.",
      "Effective anti-litter policies should balance personal responsibility with practical support, recognizing that education alone may not work without convenient options. A reasonable approach pairs clear rules and proportionate enforcement with ample bins, regular collection, and public awareness campaigns that make proper disposal easy and socially expected. Complementing this with incentives like deposit-return systems and partnerships with businesses and community groups can reduce waste at the source while keeping public spaces clean and welcoming.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering in public spaces should combine practical infrastructure\u2014such as plentiful, well-maintained bins and regular collection\u2014with fair enforcement for repeat or egregious violations. At the same time, public education and community-led incentives can encourage voluntary compliance without relying solely on penalties. By pairing shared responsibility with targeted accountability, communities can reduce litter while respecting concerns about cost, equity, and over-policing.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that pairs personal responsibility with practical support from local government and businesses. Communities can combine fair, consistently enforced penalties for repeat offenders with positive incentives, education, and clear norms that encourage proper disposal. At the same time, investing in abundant, well-placed bins, regular cleanups, and thoughtful product and packaging policies makes it easier for people to do the right thing without overburdening any single group.",
      "The most effective anti-littering policies combine shared responsibility: making it easy to dispose of waste (well-placed bins, recycling, and regular collection) while holding people and businesses accountable through fair, consistent enforcement for repeat or egregious violations. Pairing modest penalties with education and positive incentives\u2014like community cleanups, deposit-return programs, and recognition for litter-free areas\u2014can build long-term norms without relying solely on punishment. By investing in prevention, infrastructure, and targeted enforcement, communities can reduce litter while respecting concerns about cost, fairness, and personal freedom."
