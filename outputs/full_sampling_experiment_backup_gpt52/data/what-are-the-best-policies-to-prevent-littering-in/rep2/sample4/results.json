      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, combining clear enforcement and fair penalties with convenient, well-maintained disposal and recycling options. People who prioritize deterrence can support consistent rules and targeted fines in high-litter areas, while those focused on education can back public awareness campaigns and community cleanups that build shared norms. A consensus approach uses data to focus resources, ensures businesses and municipalities maintain clean public spaces, and measures outcomes so strategies can be adjusted over time.",
      "Effective anti-litter policies should combine fair enforcement with practical support, recognizing that some people prioritize personal responsibility while others emphasize better public infrastructure. A balanced approach pairs visible, proportionate fines and consistent rules with convenient, well-maintained bins, regular street cleaning, and clear signage to make proper disposal easy. Education and community partnerships can reinforce norms over time, while targeted measures in high-traffic areas help ensure limited resources are used where they have the greatest impact.",
      "The most effective anti-littering approach balances personal responsibility with practical support: clear rules and fair, consistent enforcement alongside convenient, well-maintained bins and regular cleanup. Education and positive incentives can build norms without relying solely on punishment, while targeted fines for repeat or high-impact violations address those who ignore shared standards. Pairing these measures with data-driven evaluation and community partnerships can reduce litter in a way that\u2019s both effective and broadly acceptable.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical support. Communities can pair clear rules and fair, consistent enforcement with convenient disposal options, regular maintenance, and education that makes doing the right thing easy. This middle ground respects concerns about over-policing and costs while recognizing that shared public spaces require both accountability and accessible infrastructure.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, combining clear penalties and consistent enforcement with convenient disposal options like well-placed bins and regular maintenance. While some emphasize tougher fines and others prioritize education and community norms, a blended approach\u2014public awareness campaigns, school and neighborhood cleanups, and data-driven enforcement in hotspot areas\u2014can address both causes and consequences. Pairing these measures with transparent reporting on results and reinvesting fine revenue into local cleanliness efforts can build trust and sustain improvements over time."
