      "The best approach to preventing littering in public spaces combines personal responsibility with practical support: making disposal easy through well-placed bins, clear signage, and regular maintenance, while also educating the public and businesses about shared stewardship. For those who prioritize accountability, fair and consistently enforced fines can deter repeat offenders, but they should be paired with community service or diversion options so enforcement remains equitable. By blending infrastructure, education, and proportionate enforcement, communities can reduce litter without over-relying on punishment or assuming behavior will change without support.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine practical infrastructure (more bins, reliable pickup, and clear signage) with fair enforcement so public spaces stay clean without over-penalizing people. While some prioritize education and community pride and others emphasize fines and accountability, both can work together through public awareness campaigns paired with consistent, proportionate penalties for repeat or egregious violations. Investing in accessible disposal options and partnering with local groups and businesses can reduce litter at the source and build shared responsibility.",
      "The most effective approach to preventing littering combines personal responsibility with practical, fair public support: ample, well-placed bins and regular maintenance, paired with clear expectations through signage and education. For those who favor deterrence, targeted enforcement and proportionate fines can be used in high-problem areas, while those who prefer positive incentives can support community cleanups, deposit-return programs, and recognition for compliant businesses and neighborhoods. By focusing on convenience, consistent norms, and measured accountability, communities can reduce litter without over-policing or relying solely on voluntary behavior.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine practical infrastructure\u2014like ample, well-placed bins and regular maintenance\u2014with fair, consistently enforced penalties for repeat or deliberate offenders. Many people also agree that education and community-based initiatives (school programs, clear signage, and local cleanups) can reduce litter without over-policing. By pairing convenient disposal options and public awareness with proportionate enforcement, communities can improve cleanliness while respecting budget limits and individual freedoms.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine practical infrastructure\u2014like plentiful, well-maintained bins and regular collection\u2014with fair, consistently enforced penalties for repeat or intentional offenders. At the same time, public education, clear signage, and community-led cleanups can build shared norms without relying solely on punishment. Pairing incentives and support (e.g., deposit-return programs and business partnerships) with targeted enforcement can reduce litter while respecting both personal responsibility and the need for effective public services."
