      "The most effective anti-littering approach balances shared personal responsibility with practical public support: clear rules and fair, consistent enforcement alongside ample, well-maintained bins and regular cleaning. Those who favor education and those who prioritize penalties can agree on targeted outreach, simple signage, and community programs, paired with escalating fines for repeat or deliberate dumping. By combining prevention, convenience, and accountability\u2014and measuring results transparently\u2014cities can reduce litter without relying solely on punishment or solely on voluntary compliance.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines shared responsibility with practical support. Many people favor education and community pride, while others emphasize enforcement; a consensus policy can pair clear rules and fair, consistent penalties with well-maintained bins, regular collection, and targeted public awareness campaigns. Investing in convenient disposal options and partnering with local groups and businesses can reduce litter without relying solely on punitive measures.",
      "Effective anti-littering policy should balance personal responsibility with practical support, combining clear rules and fair enforcement with convenient disposal options and consistent maintenance. People who favor stronger penalties can be met with targeted, proportionate fines for repeat or high-impact violations, while those who prioritize education can support sustained public awareness campaigns and school/community programs. Investing in well-placed bins, regular collection, and partnerships with businesses and event organizers helps make compliance easy and keeps public spaces clean for everyone.",

Investing in convenient bins, regular cleaning, and clear signage\u2014alongside education and community partnerships\u2014can reduce litter without relying solely on punitive measures. Targeted fines and accountability for businesses and event organizers, paired with incentives like deposit-return programs, offer a pragmatic middle ground that protects public spaces while respecting differing views on regulation.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical public support. Communities can pair clear, fair enforcement and anti-dumping penalties with convenient, well-maintained disposal and recycling options, regular cleanups, and education that builds shared norms. Using data to target hotspots and reinvesting fines into local sanitation can address concerns about costs and over-policing while keeping streets, parks, and waterways clean."
