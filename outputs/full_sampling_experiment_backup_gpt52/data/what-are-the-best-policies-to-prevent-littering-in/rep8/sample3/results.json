      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility with practical support and fair enforcement. Investing in well-placed bins, regular collection, and public education respects those who prefer voluntary compliance, while targeted fines and cleanup requirements for repeat offenders address concerns that rules need consequences. Partnering with local businesses and community groups for cleanup efforts and incentives can build shared ownership without overburdening any one group.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine fair, consistently enforced rules with practical support that makes proper disposal easy. This can include well-placed bins and recycling options, regular cleaning, and public education, alongside proportionate fines for repeat or intentional violations. By pairing personal responsibility with well-funded infrastructure and community engagement, public spaces can stay clean without relying solely on punishment or expecting behavior change without providing the means.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced mix of convenience, accountability, and education. Communities can expand well-placed bins and regular cleanups while using fair, consistently enforced penalties for repeated or intentional littering. Pairing enforcement with public awareness campaigns and partnerships with businesses and schools helps build shared norms without overburdening residents or creating a punitive system.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best with a balanced approach that combines personal responsibility and fair, practical public support. Communities can pair consistent enforcement and meaningful penalties with convenient, well-maintained disposal options, clear signage, and education that builds shared norms. Complementing this with incentives and community-led cleanups can reduce conflict while delivering cleaner, safer public areas for everyone.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine practical infrastructure and fair enforcement: make proper disposal easy with well-placed bins, regular collection, and clear signage, while using proportionate penalties for repeat or egregious offenders. At the same time, education campaigns and community-led cleanups can build shared norms without over-policing, and incentives or deposit-return programs can reduce waste at the source. By focusing on prevention first and targeted accountability second, communities can protect public spaces while respecting budget limits and differing views on regulation."
