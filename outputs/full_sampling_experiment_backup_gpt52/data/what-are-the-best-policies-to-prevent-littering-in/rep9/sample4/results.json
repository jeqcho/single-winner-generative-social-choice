      "The most effective anti-littering approach balances personal responsibility with practical support, combining clear rules and fair enforcement with convenient disposal options. Investing in more bins, regular maintenance, and targeted education can reduce litter without relying solely on fines, while proportionate penalties and community service can address repeat violations. Policies should be designed with local input so they are equitable, workable for businesses and residents, and focused on keeping public spaces clean for everyone.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine personal responsibility with practical public support: clear rules and fair, consistent enforcement alongside convenient bins, regular collection, and well-maintained public spaces. While some prioritize stricter penalties and others emphasize education and community norms, both perspectives can align around making proper disposal easy and expected through signage, school and community campaigns, and partnerships with local businesses. Targeting resources to litter hotspots and measuring results can keep policies effective, cost-conscious, and responsive to local needs.",
      "The most effective anti-littering policies combine personal responsibility with practical support: clear rules and fair enforcement alongside convenient bins, regular maintenance, and better waste infrastructure. Those who prioritize accountability can support proportionate fines and community service for repeat offenders, while those focused on root causes can back education, incentives, and cleanup partnerships that make proper disposal easier. A balanced approach also targets major sources\u2014like packaging and event waste\u2014through producer responsibility and venue requirements, aiming to reduce litter without overburdening residents or small businesses.",
      "A balanced approach to preventing littering should combine shared personal responsibility with practical public support: clear rules and fair fines, paired with convenient, well-maintained bins and regular cleanup. For those who favor education over punishment, consistent signage and community campaigns can reinforce norms, while data-driven enforcement focuses on chronic hotspots and repeat offenders. Investing in waste infrastructure and partnering with businesses and organizers can reduce litter at the source without overburdening taxpayers or relying solely on penalties.",
      "The most effective approach to preventing littering combines personal responsibility with practical, well-designed public systems. Communities can agree on maintaining clean shared spaces by pairing convenient disposal options and regular maintenance with consistent, fair enforcement, while also using education and incentives to build lasting habits. This balanced mix respects concerns about costs and over-policing by prioritizing prevention first and reserving penalties for repeated or deliberate violations."
