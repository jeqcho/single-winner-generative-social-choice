      "While recognizing that individuals value both personal choice and broad access to care, the government should ensure a baseline of affordable, high-quality healthcare coverage for all through targeted public programs and regulations, while allowing private providers and insurers to innovate and compete. By guaranteeing essential services, protecting patients from catastrophic costs, and promoting efficiency and transparency, government actions can provide a reliable safety net without eliminating options for those who prefer private plans.",
