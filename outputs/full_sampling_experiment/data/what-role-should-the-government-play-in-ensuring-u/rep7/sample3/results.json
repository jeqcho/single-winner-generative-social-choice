      "The government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare by setting standards, providing subsidies or insurance options for those who cannot afford care, and ensuring a transparent regulatory framework to control costs and protect patient rights. At the same time, it should encourage private innovation and choice through partnerships and competition, while focusing public resources on equity, preventive care, and reducing administrative waste so that both fiscal responsibility and broad access are balanced.",
      "The government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare services while preserving choice and innovation within the health system. By combining targeted public financing and safety-net programs for the vulnerable with regulatory measures that promote transparency, cost control, and competition, policymakers can protect public health and financial security without eliminating private options or stifling medical advances.",
      "While people differ on the extent of government involvement, most can agree that the public sector should ensure every person has access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare and protections against catastrophic medical costs. The government can achieve this through a mix of policies\u2014such as funding safety-net programs, regulating insurers for fairness and transparency, expanding preventive and primary care access, and partnering with private providers\u2014while preserving choice and encouraging innovation to improve efficiency and outcomes.",
      "While people differ on the extent of public involvement, the government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare while preserving room for private innovation and choice. By guaranteeing a minimum standard of coverage, protecting against catastrophic costs, and investing in preventive care and efficient delivery, government action can secure broad public benefits while allowing diverse models and providers to coexist."
