      "Government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, quality basic healthcare while preserving options for innovation and private choice. By guaranteeing a clear baseline of essential services and protecting vulnerable populations, public policy can reduce barriers to care and control costs, while regulatory flexibility and partnerships with private providers can respect individual preferences and encourage efficiency.",
      "The government should ensure that every person has access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare while preserving choice and innovation in the health system. This can be achieved through a mix of public programs for vulnerable populations, incentives and regulations to keep private insurance and providers accountable and affordable, and targeted investments in preventive care and infrastructure so that coverage is sustainable and responsive to diverse needs.",
      "The government should ensure that every person has access to basic, affordable healthcare while preserving room for private innovation and choice; this can be achieved through a mixed approach that guarantees a publicly funded safety net and subsidies for those in need, alongside regulated private options. By focusing on universal access, cost transparency, and quality standards, policymakers can address concerns about equity and fiscal responsibility while accommodating differing views on the role of markets and individual choice.",
      "The government should ensure that every person has access to essential, affordable healthcare by setting and enforcing basic coverage standards and supporting safety-net programs, while preserving space for private innovation and choice. By combining public funding or subsidies for those who cannot afford care with regulatory measures that promote transparency, competition, and quality, policymakers can protect vulnerable populations without eliminating private providers or insurers.",
      "While people differ on how to achieve it, the government should ensure that every resident has access to affordable, high-quality basic healthcare through a combination of public programs, regulated private options, and targeted subsidies. This approach respects individual choice and market innovation while establishing common standards, protections against catastrophic costs, and safeguards for vulnerable populations to promote broad coverage and health equity."
