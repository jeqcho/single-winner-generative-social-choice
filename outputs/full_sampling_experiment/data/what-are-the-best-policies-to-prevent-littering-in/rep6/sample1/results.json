Pairing these steps with incentives and partnerships that encourage businesses to reduce disposable packaging creates shared responsibility so public spaces stay clean and welcoming for everyone.",

This approach respects concerns about personal freedom and government overreach by prioritizing convenience and voluntary compliance first, while recognizing the need for targeted enforcement and community stewardship where problems persist.",
