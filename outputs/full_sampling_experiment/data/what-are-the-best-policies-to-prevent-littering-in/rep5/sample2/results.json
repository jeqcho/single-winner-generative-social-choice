      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced approach that combines clear, enforced regulations with accessible infrastructure and community engagement. While some favor stricter penalties and others emphasize education and voluntary stewardship, a coordinated strategy that includes convenient bins, regular maintenance, targeted public education, and proportionate enforcement can reduce litter while respecting community values and encouraging long-term behavior change.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces requires a balanced approach that combines clear infrastructure, consistent enforcement, and community education: provide sufficient, well-placed receptacles and regular cleaning services, pair them with fair, consistently applied penalties for repeated or egregious offenses, and invest in public campaigns that foster pride and responsibility. This mix respects concerns about personal freedom and public cost while recognizing the shared interest in clean, safe environments and encourages cooperative responsibility among individuals, businesses, and local governments.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced approach that combines clear regulations and consistent enforcement with convenient infrastructure, public education, and community engagement. By pairing reasonable fines and enforcement for repeat or deliberate offenders with accessible trash and recycling bins, regular maintenance, and campaigns that foster civic pride, communities can reduce litter while respecting fairness and individual responsibility.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces requires a balanced approach that combines clear, consistently enforced rules with convenient infrastructure and positive incentives. By pairing adequate trash and recycling receptacles, regular maintenance, and public education campaigns with fair fines and community-led stewardship programs, cities can respect individual responsibility while supporting those who need alternatives, creating cleaner shared spaces for everyone.",
      "Effective prevention of littering in public spaces combines clear, consistently enforced regulations with convenient waste and recycling infrastructure, ongoing public education, and community engagement programs. While some emphasize stronger enforcement and fines and others prioritize outreach and amenities, most stakeholders can agree that a balanced approach\u2014pairing fair enforcement with accessible bins, regular maintenance, and targeted awareness campaigns\u2014most sustainably reduces litter and preserves shared public environments."
