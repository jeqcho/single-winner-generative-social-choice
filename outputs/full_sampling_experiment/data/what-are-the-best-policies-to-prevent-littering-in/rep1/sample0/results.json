This approach respects individual responsibility while recognizing that systemic factors\u2014such as insufficient bins, unclear signage, or lack of services\u2014must be addressed to create clean, shared spaces everyone can support.",

By pairing reasonable penalties for repeat offenders with positive incentives\u2014like community clean-up programs, signage, and convenient bins\u2014communities can balance individual freedom with shared responsibility and appeal to both advocates of enforcement and supporters of education and engagement.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces requires a balanced approach that combines clear, consistently enforced rules with accessible infrastructure and public education. By pairing convenient waste and recycling bins, targeted cleanup programs, and evidence-based penalties with community outreach and incentives that promote shared responsibility, cities can reduce litter while respecting individual circumstances and encouraging long-term behavior change.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced approach that combines clear, consistently enforced regulations with accessible infrastructure such as sufficient bins and regular maintenance. Complementing these measures with public education campaigns, community engagement programs, and incentives for proper waste disposal can address both behavioral and systemic causes, respecting individual responsibility while recognizing the need for supportive public services.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced mix of clear infrastructure, fair enforcement, and public education: provide convenient, well-marked disposal and recycling options, combine consistent but proportionate penalties with community-based stewardship programs, and run targeted campaigns that explain environmental and civic impacts. This approach recognizes the need for personal responsibility and reasonable enforcement while investing in accessible facilities and positive incentives to foster long-term behavior change across diverse communities."
