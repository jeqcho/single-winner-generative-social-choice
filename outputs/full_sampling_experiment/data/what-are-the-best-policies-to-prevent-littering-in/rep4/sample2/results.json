By pairing targeted penalties for repeat or harmful offenses with positive incentives, accessible bins, regular maintenance, and campaigns that emphasize shared civic pride, policymakers can respect individual freedoms while promoting cleaner, healthier public environments.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced approach that combines clear, consistently enforced regulations with practical investments in infrastructure and education. By pairing well-placed bins and regular maintenance with targeted public awareness campaigns and community-led initiatives, policymakers can respect individual responsibility while making clean choices easy and socially supported.",
      "Effective litter-prevention policy combines practical enforcement with positive incentives: enforce sensible fines and consistent cleanup standards while investing in accessible bins, regular maintenance, and public education campaigns. This balanced approach recognizes the need for accountability and community responsibility, supports businesses and municipalities with feasible implementation, and encourages cultural shifts through education and visible infrastructure improvements.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best approached through a mix of practical infrastructure, education, and fair enforcement: provide convenient and well-marked disposal and recycling bins, run sustained public awareness campaigns about civic pride and environmental impact, and apply measured penalties for repeated offenders. This balanced strategy recognizes both the need for personal responsibility and the role of policy and design in shaping behavior, and can be tailored to local contexts through community input and ongoing evaluation."
