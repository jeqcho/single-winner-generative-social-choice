This balanced approach respects concerns about personal freedom and cost by prioritizing user-friendly design and community engagement while ensuring accountability and measurable results.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced combination of clear laws and fair enforcement, accessible infrastructure like well-placed bins and frequent cleaning, and sustained public education that fosters civic pride and responsibility. By pairing reasonable penalties for deliberate offenses with positive incentives and community engagement programs, policymakers can respect individual freedoms while promoting shared stewardship of public spaces.",
      "Effective prevention of littering in public spaces combines clear, consistently enforced regulations with positive incentives and accessible infrastructure: well-placed bins, regular maintenance, and visible signage alongside community education and occasional fines create both convenience and accountability. This balanced approach recognizes individual responsibility and the need for supportive public services, while allowing communities to tailor programs\u2014such as volunteer cleanups, deposit-return schemes, or targeted outreach\u2014to local values and budget realities.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced combination of practical infrastructure, community engagement, and fair enforcement: provide accessible waste and recycling containers, invest in regular cleaning and maintenance, run targeted education campaigns that emphasize civic pride and environmental impact, and apply proportionate penalties for persistent violators. This approach respects differing views by pairing supportive measures that make responsible behavior easy and socially rewarded with clear, consistent rules that deter habitual littering."
