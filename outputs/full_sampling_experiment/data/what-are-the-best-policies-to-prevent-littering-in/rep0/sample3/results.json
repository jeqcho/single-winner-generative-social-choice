      "Effective prevention of littering in public spaces combines education, convenient infrastructure, and fair enforcement: invest in public awareness campaigns and visible signage to build shared social norms, ensure adequate, well-placed and well-maintained trash and recycling receptacles, and apply proportionate penalties for repeat offenders while emphasizing restorative options like community clean-ups. This balanced approach respects individual responsibility and public resources, and can be adapted to local contexts through community input and regular evaluation of outcomes.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced approach that combines clear education and community outreach with practical infrastructure and enforcement: provide accessible and well-marked waste and recycling bins, run targeted awareness campaigns, and apply fair, proportionate penalties for repeat offenders. This strategy respects individual responsibility and civic pride while recognizing the need for public investment and reasonable regulation to maintain clean, safe shared environments.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced approach that combines clear laws and enforcement with accessible waste infrastructure, public education, and community engagement. While some emphasize stricter penalties and others prefer softer incentives, most can agree that fair enforcement, plentiful bins and recycling options, consistent cleanup programs, and ongoing awareness campaigns together create cleaner public areas while respecting civic responsibility and equity.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a combination of clear infrastructure, consistent enforcement, and sustained public education: provide accessible, well-marked receptacles and regular maintenance; apply fair, transparent penalties for repeated or egregious violations; and invest in community outreach and incentives that foster norms of stewardship. This balanced approach respects concerns about personal responsibility and limited enforcement resources while promoting practical, long-term behavior change through convenience, accountability, and community engagement.",
      "Effective strategies to reduce littering in public spaces combine clear, well-enforced regulations with practical infrastructure and community engagement: provide sufficient, conveniently placed bins and frequent collection, pair these with targeted education campaigns, and enforce penalties fairly to deter repeat offenses. Recognizing differences in resources and priorities, policies should be scalable and evidence-based, balancing incentives and enforcement while involving local residents and businesses in stewardship to foster long-term behavior change."
