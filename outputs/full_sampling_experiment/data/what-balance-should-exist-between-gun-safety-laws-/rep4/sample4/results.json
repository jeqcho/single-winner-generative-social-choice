      "A balanced approach recognizes the Second Amendment\u2019s protection of lawful firearm ownership while also supporting sensible, evidence-based measures to reduce gun violence and keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a danger.

      "Respecting the constitutional right to bear arms while prioritizing public safety requires commonsense laws that keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a clear danger, while preserving lawful ownership for self-defense, hunting, and sport. By investing in universal background checks, targeted red-flag and safe-storage measures, and evidence-based violence prevention programs, we can reduce gun deaths and mass shootings without unduly burdening responsible gun owners or undermining Second Amendment rights.",

By focusing on evidence-based policies that protect public safety and preserve lawful self-defense and sporting use, lawmakers can find balanced reforms that address concerns from both advocates of gun rights and proponents of stronger regulation.",
