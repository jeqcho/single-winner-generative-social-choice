This balance can be achieved through transparent, consistently enforced rules, educational programs on civil discourse, and procedures that prioritize dialogue and context over punitive reactions, so differing viewpoints are heard without compromising inclusion or safety.",
      "University campuses should remain committed to free expression while also fostering respectful, inclusive environments; this means protecting the right to voice controversial ideas but coupling that protection with clear conduct policies, robust counter-speech opportunities, and support for those affected by harmful rhetoric. By prioritizing open debate, education on civil discourse, and transparent, proportionate responses to disruptions, campuses can uphold academic freedom and community safety in a way that respects diverse viewpoints.",

By promoting open debate, providing context and resources for difficult conversations, and consistently applying transparent rules, campuses can support both intellectual freedom and the well-being of their diverse communities.",

We can balance robust debate with clear, consistently applied rules and educational programs that promote civil engagement, media literacy, and respect for diverse perspectives so that campuses remain open forums for learning and growth.",
