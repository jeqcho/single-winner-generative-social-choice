By committing to clear, consistently applied policies, fair processes for disputes, and programs that encourage dialogue and critical thinking, campuses can balance the value of free expression with the need for inclusion and safety.",

By committing to transparent rules, consistent enforcement, and programs that teach respectful engagement and critical thinking, campuses can balance free speech with the wellbeing of their diverse communities.",
      "Universities should protect robust free expression as essential to learning while also affirming responsibilities to maintain safety, non-discrimination, and civility on campus. Reasonable, content-neutral policies and transparent procedures that prioritize dialogue, uphold academic freedom, and address harassment can reconcile concerns about hate speech and disorder without unduly restricting speech.",

Institutions can balance these goals through clear, consistently applied policies that safeguard open inquiry, provide avenues for constructive dialogue and counter-speech, and offer support for those affected by harmful expression."
