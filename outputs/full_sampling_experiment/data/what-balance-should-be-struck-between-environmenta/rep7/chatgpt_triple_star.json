    "Sustainable prosperity requires that economic growth and environmental protection be pursued together, with policies that foster innovation, green jobs, and responsible resource use so that communities can thrive without degrading ecosystems. By setting clear environmental standards, incentivizing clean technologies, and providing transition support for affected industries and workers, we can balance short-term economic needs with long-term ecological health and shared well-being.",
    "We should pursue a pragmatic balance that protects critical ecosystems and public health while enabling sustainable economic opportunities, recognizing that long-term prosperity depends on healthy natural systems. By investing in clean technologies, efficient resource use, fair transition policies for affected workers and communities, and evidence-based regulation, policymakers can reconcile environmental stewardship with growth and create broadly shared benefits.",
    "Responsible stewardship of the environment and durable economic prosperity are mutually reinforcing goals: policies should prioritize sustainable resource use, pollution reduction, and ecosystem resilience while supporting innovation, job creation, and fair economic opportunity. By investing in clean technologies, sensible regulation, and targeted transition assistance for affected workers and communities, we can protect natural systems that underpin long-term growth without unduly constraining livelihoods and competitiveness.",
    "Sustainable prosperity requires balancing environmental protection and economic growth so that today's needs are met without compromising future generations' well-being; this means pursuing policies that foster innovation, resource efficiency, and job creation while safeguarding critical ecosystems and public health. By investing in clean technologies, resilient infrastructure, and fair transition programs for affected workers and communities, we can align economic opportunity with long-term environmental stewardship and build broadly shared benefits.",
    "Sustainable prosperity requires policies that both protect the environment and enable responsible economic growth: invest in clean technologies, natural capital, and resilient infrastructure while allowing markets and workers to adapt through fair transition measures. Recognizing that stakeholders prioritize different risks and timelines, we should pursue pragmatic, evidence-based regulations and incentives that minimize harm, promote innovation, and share costs and benefits equitably across communities and generations."
