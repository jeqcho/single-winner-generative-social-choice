      "Sustainable prosperity requires that we treat environmental protection and economic growth as complementary goals rather than competing priorities: policies should promote clean innovation, efficient resource use, and fair transition supports so businesses and workers can adapt. By setting science-based environmental standards paired with incentives for green investment and targeted support for affected communities, we can safeguard ecosystems while fostering resilient, inclusive economic opportunities that benefit present and future generations.",
      "We should pursue an approach that protects critical ecosystems and public health while enabling sustainable economic opportunities, recognizing that long-term prosperity depends on a healthy environment. By investing in clean technologies, smart regulation, and policies that support workers and communities through transitions, we can balance conservation with growth and distribute the costs and benefits fairly across society.",
      "Sustainable prosperity requires balancing strong environmental protections with prudent economic development so that natural systems are preserved while communities can thrive. By prioritizing policies that promote clean technology, resource efficiency, and fair transition supports for affected workers and regions, we can advance growth that respects ecological limits and shared long-term wellbeing.",
      "A balanced approach recognizes that long-term prosperity depends on healthy ecosystems, so policies should combine pragmatic environmental safeguards with measured steps to sustain economic growth and job creation. By investing in clean technologies, resilient infrastructure, and fair transition programs for affected workers and communities, governments and businesses can protect natural resources while fostering innovation and shared economic opportunity."
