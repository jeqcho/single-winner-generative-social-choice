By setting science-based environmental standards paired with incentives for green investment and targeted support for affected communities, we can safeguard ecosystems while fostering resilient, inclusive economic opportunities that benefit present and future generations.",

By investing in clean technologies, smart regulation, and policies that support workers and communities through transitions, we can balance conservation with growth and distribute the costs and benefits fairly across society.",
