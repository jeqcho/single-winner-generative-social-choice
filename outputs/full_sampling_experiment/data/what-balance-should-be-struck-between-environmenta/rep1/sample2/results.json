By investing in clean technologies, resource-efficient practices, and fair transition measures for affected workers and communities, we can foster innovation and jobs while maintaining healthy ecosystems; reasonable, evidence-based regulations and incentives should guide this balance and be adapted as science and social needs evolve."
