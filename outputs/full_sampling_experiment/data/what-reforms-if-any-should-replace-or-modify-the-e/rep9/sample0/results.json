These steps can be phased and evaluated to build broad public trust before any final decision on a full popular vote replacement.",

      "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the relationship between the national popular vote and the presidency, and the belief that it protects federalism and smaller states\u2019 interests, we should pursue reforms that increase fairness and public confidence without upending state representation. Practical steps such as adopting a national popular vote compact, allocating electoral votes by congressional district with safeguards, or refining state-level rules for faithless electors can balance majority rule with regional representation and be implemented through constitutional or state processes with broad bipartisan support.",
      "While recognizing concerns about both unequal state influence and the potential for unchecked national majorities, we should pursue reforms that preserve federalism while increasing voter equality \u2014 for example by adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or modifying vote allocation methods to better reflect statewide popular will. Any change should include safeguards for minority and regional voices, transparent implementation, and bipartisan review to ensure legitimacy and public trust.",
      "While recognizing concerns about both the Electoral College\u2019s emphasis on swing states and the challenges of a purely national popular vote, we should pursue reforms that increase fairness and public confidence\u2014such as adopting a proportional or district-based allocation of electors, expanding access to voting, and ensuring transparent, uniform procedures for counting ballots. These changes aim to preserve the federal character of presidential elections while making every vote more meaningful and reducing incentives for polarization and disenfranchisement.",
      "While recognizing concerns about fairness, state sovereignty, and the need for broad national support for presidents, the Electoral College could be reformed rather than abolished by adopting measures that increase proportionality, transparency, and voter influence\u2014such as awarding electoral votes proportionally or through district-based allocation combined with a national popular-tiebreaker. These changes would preserve the role of states and encourage candidates to campaign more broadly, while addressing disparities in vote weight and enhancing public confidence in the outcome.",
      "The Electoral College should be reformed to better reflect the principle of one person, one vote while preserving incentives for candidates to campaign across states and protect minority interests; practical changes\u2014such as adopting a national popular vote compact or allocating electors proportionally within states\u2014can balance statewide representation with greater voter equity. Any reform should be implemented through clear, legally sound processes and include safeguards to ensure small states and historically marginalized communities retain a meaningful voice in presidential elections."
