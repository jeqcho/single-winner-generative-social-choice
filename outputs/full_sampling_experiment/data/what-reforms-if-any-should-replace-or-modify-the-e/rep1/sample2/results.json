    "new_statement": "The Electoral College has strengths in protecting smaller states and preserving our federal system, but it also creates perceptions that some votes matter less\u2014so we should pursue moderate, workable reforms rather than abrupt change. Practical steps could include binding electors to the statewide popular vote, reducing faithless elector risk, and encouraging states to experiment with proportional or district-based allocations while continuing to study a pathway toward a national popular vote if broad bipartisan consensus and constitutional clarity emerge. These measures aim to improve fairness and turnout without discarding the balance between states and the national interest.",

      "While recognizing concerns about both the Electoral College\u2019s potential to distort the popular will and the value some place on federalism and state-based representation, we should pursue moderate reforms that increase fairness and democratic legitimacy without upending the constitutional framework. Practical steps\u2014such as adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact among enough states, allocating electors by congressional district with two statewide electors to preserve small-state voice, or instituting ranked-choice voting for presidential elections\u2014can better align outcomes with voter preferences, encourage nationwide campaigning, and protect minority and regional interests. These incremental changes aim to balance majority rule, broad geographic representation, and political stability while leaving room for future adjustments through democratic processes.",
      "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the popular will and that states\u2019 interests and federal balance also deserve protection, we should pursue targeted reforms that increase fairness and public confidence without discarding federalism. Practical steps\u2014such as adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, refining how electors are allocated within states, and strengthening safeguards against faithless electors\u2014can preserve state roles while ensuring that presidential outcomes more closely reflect voters\u2019 preferences. These changes aim to bridge urban and rural, large and small-state interests by enhancing transparency, competitiveness, and legitimacy in presidential elections.",
      "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the popular will and that direct nationwide voting could strengthen democratic legitimacy, we also acknowledge states\u2019 interests in federalism and the value some place on preserving geographic balance. A sensible middle path would keep the Electoral College\u2019s state-based framework but reform it to better reflect voters\u2019 preferences\u2014by adopting proportional or district-based allocation of electors, ensuring transparency, and pursuing measures to protect voting access\u2014so that outcomes more closely match the national and diverse regional will without upending the constitutional role of states.",
      "While opinions differ on whether to keep, abolish, or reform the Electoral College, a pragmatic middle-ground is to retain the institution but modify it to better reflect the popular will\u2014for example through a national popular vote compact or proportional allocation of electors by state. Such measures preserve federalism and state interests while reducing distortions, encouraging broader voter engagement, and ensuring that the candidate with the widest support is more likely to prevail.",
      "While supporters value the Electoral College for protecting smaller states and fostering broad geographic coalitions, critics urge reforms to better reflect the popular will; a reasonable middle ground is to retain a federal framework but pursue targeted reforms\u2014such as proportional allocation of electoral votes within states, adoption of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, or clearer standards for faithless electors\u2014to increase representativeness and voter equality without abolishing the institutional role of states. Any changes should be pursued through bipartisan legislation and/or interstate agreements that preserve federalism, ensure transparency, and guard against unintended consequences, allowing Americans across the political spectrum to see their voices fairly counted."
