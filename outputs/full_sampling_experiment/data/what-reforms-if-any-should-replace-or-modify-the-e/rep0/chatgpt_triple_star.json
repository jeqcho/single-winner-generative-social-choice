    "The Electoral College should be reformed to better reflect popular will while preserving the federal balance that protects smaller states\u2019 interests. A reasonable path forward is to retain state-based electors but adopt measures\u2014such as proportional allocation of electoral votes, National Popular Vote agreements, or improved safeguards for faithless electors\u2014to ensure candidates who win broad national support are more likely to prevail; these changes can be phased in with bipartisan review to address concerns about fairness, representation, and constitutional constraints.",
    "While perspectives differ on the Electoral College\u2019s role, a pragmatic reform package\u2014such as maintaining the Electoral College framework but allocating electors by statewide popular vote with proportional or district-based adjustments and safeguards to protect small-state representation\u2014can balance national popular legitimacy with federalist concerns. Coupled with measures to enhance ballot access, transparency, and public civic education, this approach honors the principle of equal voter influence while preserving incentives for candidates to address regional interests.",
    "Recognizing concerns about both democratic representation and the stability of the presidential selection process, we should pursue targeted reforms that preserve federalism while enhancing voter equality \u2014 for example, adopting a proportional or hybrid electoral vote allocation combined with safeguards for minority interests and clear national popular vote contingencies. Such changes would aim to respect states' roles, reduce the likelihood of candidates winning without broad support, and ensure every vote has more equal weight, while allowing room for further adjustments if unintended consequences emerge.",
    "While acknowledging concerns that the Electoral College can distort the popular will and the desire to preserve federalism and state influence, a balanced reform is to retain state-based electors but allocate them more proportionally and require a national popular tally as a tiebreaker or legitimacy benchmark. Such changes would reduce the outsized impact of a few swing states and discourage campaign neglect, while maintaining the role of states and preventing abrupt, sweeping constitutional shifts that many find unsettling.",
    "While recognizing concerns that the Electoral College can distort the popular will and that direct national voting could heighten turnout and fairness, we also acknowledge its role in protecting federalism and encouraging campaign attention to smaller states and regions. A balanced reform\u2014such as adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, refining the allocation of electors to reduce winner-take-all distortions, or pairing a popular-vote bonus with safeguards for state interests\u2014can preserve incentives for broad geographic engagement while ensuring that the overall outcome more closely reflects voters\u2019 will."
