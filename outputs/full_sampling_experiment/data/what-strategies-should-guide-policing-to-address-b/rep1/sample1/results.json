This approach recognizes the need for effective crime prevention and officer safety while affirming limits on intrusive practices, independent oversight, and investments in training and social services that reduce reliance on force. Together these measures foster trust, legitimacy, and safer communities for everyone.",

By committing to measurable outcomes, independent review, and regular community input, departments can build trust, reduce harm, and ensure equitable enforcement that respects both security and individual liberties.",
      "Policing should prioritize public safety while upholding civil rights by combining transparent, accountable practices with community-centered strategies that prevent harm and build trust. Law enforcement agencies, community members, and policymakers should collaborate on clear use-of-force standards, regular oversight, de-escalation training, and accessible complaint and review processes to ensure both effective crime reduction and protection of individual liberties.",
      "Policing should be guided by strategies that equally prioritize public safety and the protection of civil rights, combining effective crime prevention and community engagement with clear accountability and transparent oversight. By investing in de-escalation training, bias reduction, mental health and social services partnerships, and data-driven practices while enforcing consistent standards of conduct and independent review, agencies can build public trust and safer communities that respect the dignity and rights of all people.",
