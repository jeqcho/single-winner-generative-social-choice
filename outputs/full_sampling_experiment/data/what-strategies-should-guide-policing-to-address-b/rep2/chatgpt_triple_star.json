    "Policing should balance the imperative of public safety with rigorous protection of civil rights by using transparent, accountable practices that are evidence-based and community-informed. While acknowledging the need for effective law enforcement to prevent harm, agencies should build trust through independent oversight, de-escalation training, clear use-of-force standards, and investments in social services that address root causes of crime, so that safety and liberty are mutually reinforced rather than in tension.",
    "Policing should prioritize public safety while rigorously protecting civil rights by combining evidence-based crime prevention, transparent accountability, and community partnership; officers must be trained and supported to use de-escalation and bias-aware practices, with independent oversight to investigate misconduct. This approach recognizes the need for effective law enforcement to reduce harm and the legitimate concerns about abuse of power, seeking common ground through clear policies, data-driven evaluation, and ongoing community input to build trust and equitable outcomes.",
    "Policing should be guided by strategies that equally prioritize public safety and the protection of civil rights, combining evidence-based crime prevention and accountability measures with clear rules that respect individual liberties. This approach recognizes community concerns about both security and fairness by investing in de-escalation training, transparent oversight, and community partnerships while ensuring lawful, proportionate use of force and unbiased enforcement. ",
    "Policing should be guided by a commitment to protect public safety while upholding constitutional rights, using clear, accountable policies that prioritize de-escalation, community engagement, and transparent oversight. By investing in officer training, mental health and social services partnerships, and data-driven practices that are regularly reviewed by diverse community stakeholders, departments can build trust and reduce harm while effectively addressing crime.",
    "Policing should prioritize public safety while rigorously upholding civil rights by adopting transparent, accountable practices that prevent abuse and build community trust. This balance is achieved through clear use-of-force standards, independent oversight, regular training in de-escalation and bias reduction, and meaningful community engagement so that law enforcement protects everyone fairly and effectively."
