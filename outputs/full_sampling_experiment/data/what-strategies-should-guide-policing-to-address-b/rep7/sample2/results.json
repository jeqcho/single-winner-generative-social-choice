We can bridge concerns about security and liberty by committing to data-driven performance measures, independent review of misconduct, and sustained dialogue with affected communities so that enforcement is effective, equitable, and trusted by the people it serves.",

By investing in training on de-escalation, bias reduction, and cultural competency alongside social services and mental-health resources, law enforcement can more effectively protect communities and respect individual liberties, reflecting shared values of security and justice.",

By investing in training, mental health and social services, and data-driven practices, law enforcement can build trust across diverse communities while ensuring officers operate within clear legal and ethical standards that respect individual liberties.",
