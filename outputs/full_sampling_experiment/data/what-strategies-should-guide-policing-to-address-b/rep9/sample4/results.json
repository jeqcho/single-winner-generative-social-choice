Recognizing legitimate concerns about crime and civil liberties, agencies should adopt clear policies, independent oversight, and data-driven reforms that build trust, reduce harm, and ensure equitable treatment for all communities.",

Agencies and communities can find common ground by investing in training, oversight, and alternatives to arrest for mental health and social crises, ensuring that enforcement is fair, data-driven, and subject to independent review to build trust and reduce harm.",
      "Policing should prioritize public safety while steadfastly protecting civil rights by combining transparent, accountable practices with community partnership and clear, rights-respecting use-of-force standards. Recognizing that communities and officers both seek secure neighborhoods, policies should invest in training, de-escalation, bias mitigation, and independent oversight alongside robust support for mental-health and social services to reduce confrontations. This balanced approach honors the need for effective law enforcement while ensuring that enforcement is fair, impartial, and subject to meaningful review."
