Reasonable, narrowly tailored limits \u2014 focused on preventing harm rather than suppressing unpopular opinions \u2014 combined with robust counter-speech, education, and support for vulnerable communities can balance free expression with the need to protect individuals from real-world harm.",
      "Free speech should be broadly protected as a foundation of democratic discourse, but it is reasonable to limit expressions that intentionally incite imminent violence, directly target and threaten individuals or protected groups, or constitute harassment that prevents others from participating in public life. At the same time, limits should be narrowly defined, evidence-based, and subject to transparent legal standards and due process to avoid chilling legitimate debate, satire, or critical discussion of ideas. This approach balances the value of open expression with the need to protect safety, dignity, and equal access to civic participation.",
