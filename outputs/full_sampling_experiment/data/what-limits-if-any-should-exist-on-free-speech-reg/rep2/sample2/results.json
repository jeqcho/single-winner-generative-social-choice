At the same time, limits should be narrowly defined, evidence-based, and subject to transparent legal standards and due process to avoid chilling legitimate debate, satire, or critical discussion of ideas. This approach balances the value of open expression with the need to protect safety, dignity, and equal access to civic participation.",
