    "Free speech should be broadly protected to preserve open dialogue and the exchange of ideas, but limits are warranted where speech intentionally and directly incites violence, harassment, or discrimination against protected groups. Reasonable, narrowly tailored restrictions that target clear threats and unlawful conduct\u2014while preserving robust debate and dissent\u2014balance the need to protect vulnerable communities with the fundamental value of free expression.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected as essential to democratic discourse, but limited where it intentionally incites imminent violence or constitutes targeted harassment that directly harms individuals or vulnerable groups. At the same time, responses to hateful ideas should prioritize non-censorial measures\u2014education, counter-speech, and support for affected communities\u2014while narrowly tailored legal restrictions address only clear, immediate risks to safety and equal rights.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected to allow open debate and the exchange of ideas, but it should not extend to direct incitement of violence, credible threats, or targeted harassment that undermines others\u2019 safety and basic rights. Reasonable, narrowly tailored limits \u2014 focused on preventing harm rather than suppressing unpopular opinions \u2014 combined with robust counter-speech, education, and support for vulnerable communities can balance free expression with the need to protect individuals from real-world harm.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected as a foundation of democratic discourse, but it is reasonable to limit expressions that intentionally incite imminent violence, directly target and threaten individuals or protected groups, or constitute harassment that prevents others from participating in public life. At the same time, limits should be narrowly defined, evidence-based, and subject to transparent legal standards and due process to avoid chilling legitimate debate, satire, or critical discussion of ideas. This approach balances the value of open expression with the need to protect safety, dignity, and equal access to civic participation.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected to preserve open debate and individual liberty, but reasonable limits are justified where speech directly and intentionally incites violence, targets identifiable groups with imminent threats, or constitutes coordinated harassment that prevents others from participating in public life. Policies should prioritize clear, narrowly defined criteria and due process to avoid chilling legitimate expression, while investing in education, counter-speech, and support for affected communities to address harms without resorting to overly broad censorship."
