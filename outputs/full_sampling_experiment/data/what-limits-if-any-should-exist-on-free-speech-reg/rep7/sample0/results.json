      "Free speech is a fundamental right that should be protected, but it is reasonable to limit expressions that intentionally incite violence, direct threats, or imminent lawless action while otherwise permitting robust debate and even offensive opinions. Laws and policies should be narrowly tailored, transparent, and applied with due process to prevent harm and protect vulnerable groups, while preserving space for dissent, criticism, and contestation of ideas so society can address prejudice through education and dialogue rather than broad censorship.",
      "Free speech is a fundamental right that should be broadly protected, but it is reasonable to limit expressions that intentionally and imminently incite violence, harassment, or targeted discrimination against protected groups; otherwise, the public square should favor open debate and the exchange of ideas. These limits should be narrowly defined, transparent, and subject to legal safeguards and oversight to prevent abuse, while efforts to counter hateful ideas should prioritize education, support for affected communities, and non-coercive measures that preserve civic discourse.",
      "Free speech is a fundamental right that should be vigorously protected, but it is reasonable to limit expressions that intentionally incite imminent violence, discrimination, or targeted harassment against protected groups while preserving robust debate and criticism. Laws and policies should narrowly define and demonstrably show harm or intent before restricting speech, and be paired with education, counter-speech, and support for affected communities to address underlying harms without broadly silencing dissenting or unpopular views.",
      "Free speech should be broadly protected to preserve open debate and individual autonomy, while limited only where expression directly and imminently incites violence, harassment, or targeted harm to identifiable groups or individuals; nonviolent, offensive, or unpopular views should generally be countered with more speech, education, and community norms rather than legal sanction. This approach recognizes the need to safeguard vulnerable communities from real harm and to hold actors accountable for targeted abuse, while preserving robust public discourse and avoiding overbroad censorship of dissenting or controversial ideas.",
      "Free speech is essential to a healthy democracy, but it is not absolute; reasonable limits may be warranted where speech directly incites violence, harassment, or targeted dehumanization that foreseeably leads to harm. At the same time, restrictions should be narrowly defined, subject to transparent legal standards and independent review, and balanced against the need to protect robust public debate and dissent so that efforts to curb hate do not become tools for silencing legitimate expression."
