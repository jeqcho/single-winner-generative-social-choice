    "Free speech is a fundamental right that should be broadly protected, but it is reasonable to limit expressions that intentionally incite imminent violence, target individuals with direct threats, or constitute unlawful harassment; at the same time, speech that offends or criticizes ideas, beliefs, or groups should generally be countered with more speech, education, and community norms rather than legal punishment. Balancing protections for vulnerable people with safeguards for open debate requires narrowly tailored, transparent laws and policies, clear definitions of harm, and principled commitments to due process and restorative remedies where possible.",
    "Free speech is a fundamental right that should be broadly protected while recognizing limits where speech directly and imminently incites violence, targeted threats, or other unlawful harms; measures should focus narrowly on preventing clear, demonstrable danger rather than silencing unpopular or offensive opinions. Policies and enforcement should be transparent, proportionate, and subject to due process, accompanied by educational and community-based efforts to counter hate and promote respectful discourse so that rights and safety are both upheld.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected as a foundation for democratic dialogue, but limits are appropriate where speech intentionally and directly incites imminent violence, coordinates abuse, or targets individuals in ways that foreseeably cause serious harm; context, intent, and likelihood of harm should guide any restriction. At the same time, society should prioritize non-coercive responses\u2014education, counter-speech, and restorative measures\u2014to address hateful ideas while reserving legal sanctions for the narrowest, clearly defined cases where public safety or individual rights are at real risk.",
    "Free speech is a fundamental right that should be broadly protected, but it is reasonable to limit expressions that intentionally incite violence, coordinate harm, or constitute targeted threats against identifiable individuals or groups. At the same time, laws and policies should avoid overly broad or vague restrictions that chill legitimate debate, allow for context-sensitive assessment (including intent and likelihood of harm), and prioritize education and counter-speech as complementary responses to hateful ideas.",
    "Free speech should be broadly protected to allow robust discussion and the airing of unpopular ideas, while narrowly limiting direct, intentional incitement to violence, true threats, and targeted harassment that foreseeably cause harm. Reasonable limits should focus on conduct and clear harms rather than suppressing offensive ideas or abstract expressions, coupled with strong legal and social protections for vulnerable groups and mechanisms for non-criminal remedies like counterspeech, education, and platform moderation to address harmful rhetoric without unduly chilling legitimate debate."
