    "Laws on abortion should balance respect for reproductive autonomy with protections for fetal life by ensuring accessible, safe care early in pregnancy while allowing for thoughtful limits grounded in medical evidence and widely held ethical considerations. Policy should guarantee comprehensive sex education, contraception access, and support for parents and children so that fewer people face unwanted pregnancies, while permitting reasonable, clearly defined restrictions later in pregnancy that reflect medical necessity and societal interests.",
    "Laws governing abortion should protect the health, autonomy, and dignity of pregnant people while recognizing the moral concerns and potential interests of others; they should ensure safe, accessible care early in pregnancy, allow time-limited exceptions, and provide support for parenting and alternatives like adoption. Policy should be grounded in medical evidence, respect for individual conscience, and practical measures\u2014such as counseling, social services, and safeguards against coercion\u2014that reduce unwanted pregnancies and help families thrive.",
    "Laws governing abortion should protect individual health, safety, and dignity while recognizing the moral concerns others hold about fetal life; they should ensure timely access to safe medical care, especially for those facing medical risks or socioeconomic hardship, while allowing for reasonable limits that reflect compelling state interests applied transparently and based on medical evidence. Policymaking should prioritize reducing the need for abortion through comprehensive sex education, accessible contraception, maternal supports, and healthcare access, and should be shaped through inclusive dialogue that respects conscience, public health data, and the diverse values of the community.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance the rights and health of pregnant people with respect for emerging fetal life by ensuring safe, accessible reproductive healthcare, clear protections for maternal health and informed consent, and reasonable limits grounded in medical evidence. Policy should accommodate deeply held moral convictions by providing alternatives like counseling, support for parenting and adoption, and conscientious objection for providers, while preserving timely access to care when needed to protect a person\u2019s health and autonomy.",
    "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individuals\u2019 moral convictions and bodily autonomy with a commitment to protecting health and minimizing harm, ensuring safe access to care while allowing reasonable limits informed by medical evidence. Policy should prioritize comprehensive reproductive health services, support for pregnant people and families, and safeguards for conscientious objection that do not unduly restrict access, so that diverse convictions are acknowledged without compromising public health and individual rights."
