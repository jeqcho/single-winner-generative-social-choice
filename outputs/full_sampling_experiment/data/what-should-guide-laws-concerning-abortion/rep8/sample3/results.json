      "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individuals\u2019 moral convictions and compassion for those facing difficult pregnancies with recognition of the state\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, ensuring decisions are guided by evidence, health, and human dignity. Policy should guarantee safe, timely access to reproductive health care and counseling, include reasonable limits that reflect medical realities and broad public values, and provide support services so people are empowered to make informed choices while minimizing harm.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy with a commitment to protecting health and reducing harm, ensuring that decisions are made safely, privately, and with access to accurate information and medical care. Policy should protect both the rights and wellbeing of pregnant people and reasonable moral concerns by permitting timely, supported choices while providing resources for healthcare, counseling, and social services to minimize unwanted pregnancies and support families.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should protect public health and individual dignity by ensuring safe, accessible reproductive care while recognizing deeply held moral concerns about fetal life; policy should therefore balance respect for personal autonomy with thoughtfully limited regulations that are evidence-based, aimed at minimizing harm, and allow for reasonable conscience protections. By grounding rules in medical best practices, clear timeframes informed by fetal development, and support for pregnant people and families, lawmakers can uphold both compassionate care and shared ethical commitments across differing viewpoints.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should protect both the health and autonomy of pregnant people and the societal interest in protecting potential life by ensuring access to safe, regulated medical care while allowing reasonable limits timed to fetal development and compelling state interest. Policy should be based on medical evidence, respect for individual conscience and circumstances, and provision of comprehensive support\u2014such as healthcare, counseling, and social services\u2014to reduce unwanted pregnancies and help those carrying pregnancies to term. Restrictions, when used, must be narrowly tailored, clinically informed, and include exceptions for the life and health of the pregnant person, while promoting public education and contraception access to minimize the need for abortion.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy and reproductive health with a societal interest in protecting potential life by ensuring access to safe, timely medical care while allowing reasonable limits based on gestational viability and maternal health. Policy should be grounded in medical evidence, protect people from coercion and undue burden, provide support for parenting and alternatives like adoption, and include safeguards for those with conscientious objections to care so that diverse moral perspectives are acknowledged without compromising health and equality."
