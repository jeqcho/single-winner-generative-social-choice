      "Laws concerning abortion should protect individuals' health and bodily autonomy while recognizing society\u2019s interest in supporting potential life, and therefore should ensure safe, legal access to abortion with reasonable, evidence-based limits that respect medical judgment and individual circumstances. Policy should prioritize comprehensive reproductive healthcare, access to contraception and support for parents and children, and safeguard informed consent and equitable access so that decisions are made responsibly and without undue coercion or barriers.",
      "Laws on abortion should balance respect for a person\u2019s bodily autonomy and health with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, creating a framework that prioritizes safe, accessible reproductive healthcare while allowing reasonable and narrowly tailored limits grounded in medical evidence and ethics. Policymaking should include comprehensive sex education, expanded access to contraception and prenatal care, and protections for those facing moral objections, with decisions timed and defined by clinical milestones and supported by equitable resources so that people can make informed choices without coercion or undue burden.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy and bodily integrity with thoughtful protections for prenatal life, recognizing that deeply held moral and religious beliefs vary. Policy should ensure safe, legal access to reproductive healthcare, including reasonable time-limited safeguards and support for those who carry pregnancies to term, while investing in education, contraception, and social services to reduce unwanted pregnancies and help families thrive.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should protect individual health, dignity, and the ability to make informed decisions while also recognizing the societal interest in supporting potential life; practical policy should therefore ensure safe, legal access to reproductive care alongside measures that expand healthcare, economic support, and resources for parents and children. Respectful debate is essential, and laws should be crafted through evidence-based standards, clear medical guidance, and reasonable limits that balance bodily autonomy with protections for viability and maternal health, while providing exceptions and supports that reflect compassionate compromise."
