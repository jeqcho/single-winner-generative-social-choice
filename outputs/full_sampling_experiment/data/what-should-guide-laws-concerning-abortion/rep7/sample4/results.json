Reasonable limits may be appropriate, especially later in pregnancy, while ensuring exceptions to protect the life and serious health of the pregnant person and cases of rape or incest; at the same time government should expand healthcare, contraception, family services, and adoption support so fewer people feel forced into desperate choices.

Policymaking should be guided by compassion, equitable access, scientific evidence, and support for families \u2014 including resources for prenatal care, parental leave, and adoption \u2014 so that people can make informed choices without undue coercion or harm.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy and the protection of developing life by ensuring safe, legal access early in pregnancy while permitting reasonable, well-defined limits at later stages based on medical evidence and compelling societal interests. Policy should focus on minimizing harm\u2014providing comprehensive reproductive healthcare, accurate information, and support for families\u2014while accommodating conscience protections for providers and recognizing the diverse moral convictions held by citizens.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for pregnant people\u2019s autonomy and bodily integrity with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential human life, allowing early access while imposing reasonable, evidence-based safeguards as pregnancy progresses. Policy should be informed by medical science, prioritize equitable access to healthcare and supportive services, and include exceptions for serious health risks, ensuring decisions are made with compassion and without criminalizing those seeking or providing care.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should protect individuals' health, dignity, and ability to make personal medical decisions while also respecting sincerely held moral concerns about fetal life by setting clear, evidence-based limits and supports. Policy should ensure safe, timely access to reproductive healthcare, meaningful counseling, and social services that reduce unwanted pregnancies and support parents, while permitting narrowly defined restrictions grounded in medical necessity, gestational viability, and widely shared protections for maternal health."
