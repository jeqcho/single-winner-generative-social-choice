Policy should focus on reducing unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive sex education and accessible contraception, protecting healthcare providers' conscience rights within agreed standards, and ensuring decisions are guided by medical evidence, compassion, and support for families.",

Reasonable regulation can protect health and safety, ensure access to accurate information and timely care, and include exceptions or supports that acknowledge complex circumstances, while allowing room for conscience protections and compassionate counseling for those with moral objections.",
      "Laws governing abortion should protect individual autonomy and healthcare access while recognizing the societal interest in safeguarding potential life, balancing these aims through clear, evidence-based limits and supports. Policies should ensure safe, legal care is available, provide counseling and social services to those facing pregnancy, and allow reasonable, narrowly tailored regulations that reflect medical consensus and respect conscientious objections without unduly restricting access.

Policy should prioritize comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and maternal health care to reduce unintended pregnancies, and include clear exceptions to protect the health and life of the pregnant person, with measures guided by evidence, compassion, and respect for sincere moral diversity."
