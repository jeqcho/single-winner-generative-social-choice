      "Laws on abortion should protect the health, safety, and dignity of pregnant people while recognizing the moral seriousness many attach to fetal life; therefore policy should ensure access to safe, timely reproductive care, especially in medically necessary cases, while allowing reasonable limits that reflect compelling state interests and respect for conscience. Decisions should be grounded in medical evidence, prioritize reducing harm through comprehensive sex education and contraception access, and include clear, narrowly tailored safeguards so that individuals, families, and clinicians can make private medical choices without undue burden.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should protect pregnant people's health, autonomy, and access to safe medical care while respecting society's interest in supporting fetal potential, through policies that prioritize timely, evidence-based healthcare, comprehensive reproductive education, and access to contraception and social supports. Such laws should include clear, medically grounded safeguards to ensure informed consent and prevent coercion, allow exceptions to protect maternal health and cases of serious fetal anomaly, and enable conscience protections for providers that do not unduly impede patient access. This approach seeks common ground by balancing individual rights with shared ethical concerns and by reducing unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion through prevention and support.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individual autonomy and the protection of potential life by ensuring safe, legal access early in pregnancy while permitting reasonable limits later on with clear medical exceptions. Policy should be informed by medical evidence, support for reproductive health and family resources, and safeguards that minimize harm and respect deeply held moral convictions across the spectrum.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for individuals\u2019 moral convictions and bodily autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life, establishing clear, evidence-based limits that account for gestational development and maternal health. Policies should ensure safe, accessible reproductive health care, compassionate support for those facing difficult decisions, and reasonable protections for conscience, while promoting education, contraception access, and social services to reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion.",
      "Laws concerning abortion should balance respect for reproductive autonomy with society\u2019s interest in protecting potential life by ensuring safe, legal access early in pregnancy while permitting reasonable regulations that protect maternal health and reflect medical evidence. Policy should prioritize compassionate support\u2014comprehensive sex education, access to contraception, prenatal care, and social services\u2014so fewer people face the decision, and should preserve pathways for thoughtful exceptions where pregnancy poses serious health risks or in cases of rape or incest. This approach acknowledges deeply held moral convictions on both sides while focusing on reducing harm, promoting equity, and grounding rules in science and individual circumstances."
