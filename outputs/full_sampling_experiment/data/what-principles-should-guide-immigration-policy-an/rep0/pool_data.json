We should have an efficient, humane process that protects workers from exploitation, keeps families together, and welcomes people who want to contribute to our economy and communities. A fair path to citizenship should include background checks, paying taxes, and learning our laws and language, while recognizing the dignity and humanity of those already here. In line with my environmental and social justice values, I also think we need to address the global inequalities and conflicts that push people to migrate in the first place.",

Our laws ought to reflect Catholic social teaching on welcoming the stranger, while also planning responsibly so that new residents and longstanding communities alike have access to clean air, water, and opportunity.
