A shared pathway to citizenship should include clear, achievable requirements\u2014such as background checks, payment of fines or taxes, and demonstrated commitment to civic integration\u2014while providing protections for vulnerable individuals and mechanisms to address labor needs and family unity. This compromise respects concerns about orderly borders and sovereignty while offering practical, compassionate solutions that strengthen communities and the economy.",

Recognizing concerns about jobs, public resources, and rule of law alongside the humanitarian contributions and family ties of newcomers, policy should combine fair enforcement, efficient processing, and targeted reforms\u2014such as earned legalization, employer verification, and investments in integration\u2014to promote both community stability and opportunity.",

      "Immigration policy should balance national security and economic needs with a commitment to fairness and human dignity by enforcing lawful entry while creating realistic, humane pathways for long-term residents to earn citizenship. Recognizing concerns about borders and public resources as well as the contributions of immigrants, policies should combine effective enforcement, streamlined legal immigration channels, and clear, attainable criteria for status adjustment that reward work, family ties, and civic integration."
