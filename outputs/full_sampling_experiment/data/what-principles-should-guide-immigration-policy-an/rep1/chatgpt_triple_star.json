    "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and national security with compassion and opportunity by establishing clear, enforceable pathways to work and citizenship that prioritize public safety, economic contribution, and family unity. While recognizing legitimate concerns about border control and resource capacity, the system should be fair, efficient, and humane\u2014providing predictable routes for legal migration, sensible enforcement against exploitation and undocumented entry, and a realistic, merit- and need-based path to citizenship for those who contribute to and integrate into their communities.",
    "Immigration policy should balance the nation\u2019s economic and security needs with respect for human dignity by enforcing fair, transparent rules that prioritize border integrity, timely processing, and pathways to legal status for those who contribute positively to society. Recognizing concerns about rule of law and community impact, the system should combine reasonable enforcement and vetting with humane treatment, opportunities for integration (including work authorization and language access), and clear, attainable routes to permanent residency or citizenship for qualified immigrants. By coordinating federal, state, and local resources and using data-driven policies, we can address labor needs, protect public safety, and uphold values of opportunity without encouraging illegal entry.",
    "Immigration policy should balance national security and economic needs with humanitarian obligations by enforcing clear, fair rules that prioritize public safety while creating realistic, timely pathways to citizenship for those who contribute and integrate. Acknowledging concerns about border control and cultural cohesion alongside the value of immigrants for labor markets and family unity, reform should be grounded in transparent processes, regularized legal avenues, robust border management, and opportunities for integration such as language and civic education. This approach respects the rule of law, addresses enforcement challenges, and provides humane, attainable routes to legal status for long-term residents and high-need applicants.",
    "Immigration policy should balance secure, orderly borders and the rule of law with humane treatment and practical pathways for immigrants who contribute to our communities and economy. By combining effective enforcement and clear legal channels with targeted avenues to citizenship for long-term residents, essential workers, and asylum seekers\u2014paired with fair, timely adjudication and integration support\u2014we can honor national interests while reflecting our values and shared responsibilities.",
    "Immigration policy should balance national security and economic needs with compassion and respect for human dignity by enforcing fair, transparent rules that allow skilled and family-based migration while providing orderly pathways for long-term residents to earn citizenship. It should acknowledge concerns about border control and rule of law while also recognizing the contributions of immigrants and the humanitarian imperative to protect refugees and vulnerable families, pursuing solutions that are pragmatic, enforceable, and consistent with core civic values.
