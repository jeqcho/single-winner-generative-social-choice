Deber\u00edamos tener un proceso claro, realista y justo para quienes ya contribuyen a este pa\u00eds con su trabajo y sus impuestos, incluyendo una v\u00eda a la ciudadan\u00eda para inmigrantes indocumentados sin antecedentes penales. Tambi\u00e9n es importante fortalecer la seguridad y el orden en la frontera, pero sin perder nuestra humanidad ni criminalizar a quienes buscan una vida mejor.
