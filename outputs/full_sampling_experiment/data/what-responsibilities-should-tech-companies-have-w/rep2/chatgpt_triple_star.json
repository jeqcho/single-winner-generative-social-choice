    "Tech companies should respect user privacy by collecting only the data needed to provide clear benefits, securing it robustly, and being transparent about how it is used and shared. They should give users meaningful choices and control over their information while complying with legal standards and industry best practices, balancing innovation and safety with individuals\u2019 rights. This approach recognizes the needs of businesses to develop services and protect users from harm, while honoring concerns about surveillance and misuse.",
    "Tech companies should respect users\u2019 privacy by minimizing data collection, being transparent about how data is used, and securing information against misuse, while still allowing responsible innovation and personalized services that benefit users. Regulations and industry standards should set clear baseline protections and accountability, with companies empowered to innovate within those rules and users given accessible choices and meaningful control over their data.",
    "Tech companies should protect user data by default, using transparent practices, strong security, and meaningful user controls while balancing innovation and legitimate business needs. Recognizing that users, regulators, and businesses have different priorities, companies should adopt clear, accessible privacy policies, minimize unnecessary data collection, and provide opt-in choices and robust safeguards so that privacy, usability, and responsible data-driven services can coexist.",
    "Tech companies should treat user data with transparency, purpose limitation, and strong security, balancing innovation with respect for individual privacy. While recognizing that data-driven services enable valuable products and personalization, companies must obtain informed consent, minimize collection and retention, and provide accessible controls and clear disclosures so users, regulators, and businesses can trust and benefit from responsible data practices.",
    "Tech companies should respect user privacy by collecting only necessary data, being transparent about how it is used, and implementing strong security measures, while allowing users meaningful control over their information. Recognizing both the benefits of data-driven innovation and the need to protect individuals, companies, regulators, and users should collaborate on clear, proportionate standards that enable useful services without compromising privacy or trust."
