      "Tech companies should respect user privacy by collecting only the data necessary for providing services, being transparent about how it is used, and giving users clear, easy-to-use controls over their information; regulators and advocates should ensure baseline protections while allowing companies flexibility to innovate. While perspectives differ on the balance between convenience, personalization, and security, a shared commitment to minimizing data retention, robust security practices, independent oversight, and meaningful consent can protect individuals without unduly hampering beneficial technological progress.",
      "Tech companies should treat user data with transparency, security, and respect for individual choice: collect only what is necessary, protect it with strong safeguards, and clearly communicate how it is used while offering meaningful user controls. This approach balances innovation and business needs with individuals\u2019 right to privacy, acknowledging both the value of data-driven services and concerns about misuse, and calls for accountable practices and oversight to maintain trust."
