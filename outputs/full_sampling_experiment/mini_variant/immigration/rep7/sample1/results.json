      "Immigration policy should balance national security and economic needs with respect for human dignity by creating fair, transparent rules that prioritize legal pathways, border integrity, and efficient processing. While recognizing differing views on enforcement and inclusion, a practical path to citizenship should combine accountability\u2014such as background checks, payment of fines or taxes, and demonstrated contribution to the community\u2014with opportunities for integration through language, employment, and civic education so deserving individuals can fully participate in and strengthen the nation.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and rule of law with a pragmatic, humane pathway to citizenship that recognizes immigrants' economic contributions and family ties. By combining secure, efficient borders and fair enforcement with clear, attainable steps for legal status and integration\u2014such as background checks, language and civics requirements, and opportunities for work and education\u2014we can honor both the need for orderly immigration and the moral imperative to treat people with dignity. This approach acknowledges concerns about illegal entry and resource strain while creating predictable, transparent processes that unify communities and strengthen the economy.",
      "Immigration policy should balance a secure, orderly system with humane treatment and a fair path to citizenship, recognizing the need to protect borders and enforce laws while also honoring family unity, economic contribution, and human rights. By creating clear, attainable requirements, streamlined legal channels, and targeted enforcement that prioritizes serious threats, policymakers can accommodate legitimate concerns about security and rule of law while offering integration opportunities for immigrants who contribute to the community and economy.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and border integrity with a humane, pragmatic pathway to citizenship that recognizes economic needs, family unity, and human rights. By enforcing clear, fair processes, prioritizing public safety and labor market demands, and offering conditional pathways for long-term residents who meet standards for work, language, and civic participation, we can respect legitimate concerns about sovereignty while providing stability and opportunity for immigrants and communities alike.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and border security with compassion for newcomers, creating a fair, transparent path to citizenship that rewards work, family unity, and contribution to communities. Recognizing both the need to manage borders and the humanitarian and economic benefits of migration, the system should include clear legal pathways, reasonable enforcement, and a practicable, merit- and need-based regularization process that enables integration while protecting national interests."
