      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and orderly, secure borders with a humane, practical pathway to citizenship that recognizes immigrants\u2019 contributions to society and the economy. Policies should uphold public safety and require accountability, while offering clear, attainable routes to legal status for those who meet established requirements\u2014such as background checks, work or education obligations, and timely fees\u2014coupled with opportunities for integration like language and civic education. This approach respects differing concerns about enforcement and sovereignty while embracing shared values of fairness, family unity, and economic opportunity.",

Recognizing diverse views\u2014concerns about national security, economic impact, and humanitarian responsibility\u2014policy should include fair vetting, opportunities for legal work and family reunification, and targeted support for assimilation and integration to uphold both community safety and shared values.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and economic needs with respect for human dignity by enforcing orderly, transparent procedures, prioritizing family unity, labor market realities, and the rule of law. A fair, attainable path to citizenship ought to combine accountability\u2014such as background checks, payment of fines or taxes, and learning language and civics\u2014with practical flexibility for long-term residents and essential workers, while strengthening border management and legal immigration channels to reduce irregular migration."
