Policies should combine clear, enforceable standards and fair enforcement with accessible legal routes, earned regularization for long-term residents, and targeted investment in integration services to promote civic participation and economic opportunity for newcomers and host communities alike.",
      "Immigration policy should balance a secure, orderly system with humane treatment and opportunities for integration, recognizing both the need to uphold the rule of law and the contributions immigrants make to society. A fair pathway to citizenship should combine clear eligibility criteria, background checks, and requirements that encourage economic self-sufficiency and civic participation, while offering flexibility for family unity and humanitarian cases so that the system is practical, compassionate, and broadly supported.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the need for orderly, secure borders and enforceable rules with a humane, pragmatic path to citizenship that recognizes economic contributions and family unity. By combining clear eligibility criteria, fair and timely processes, and safeguards against exploitation and abuse, policymakers can uphold the rule of law while offering responsible opportunities for integration; this approach respects concerns about security and labor markets while addressing humanitarian and economic realities.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the nation\u2019s economic and security needs with a humane, orderly process that respects human dignity and the rule of law. A practical path to citizenship should include clear eligibility criteria, requirements that incentivize integration and contribution, and timely, transparent adjudication, while protecting borders, prioritizing public safety, and honoring commitments to refugees and longtime residents. This approach recognizes both the benefits of immigration and legitimate concerns about resources and enforcement, seeking compromise through phased implementation and regular review."
