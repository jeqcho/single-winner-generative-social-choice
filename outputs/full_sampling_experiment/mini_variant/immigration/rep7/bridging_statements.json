    "statement": "As a 57\u2011year public school teacher, Catholic Democrat who values order, dignity, and quiet stewardship, I believe immigration policy should marry humane treatment with clear, enforceable rules so families aren\u2019t torn apart and communities remain safe. Having listened to many perspectives\u2014from calls for strong borders and rule\u2011of\u2011law to pleas for compassion and realistic paths to belong\u2014I think we can find common ground by ensuring orderly, timely pathways to citizenship that require accountability (work, background checks, learning English) while protecting children, refugees, and long\u2011term contributors so everyone can fully participate.",
    "original_statement": "As a Catholic and a public school teacher, I believe our immigration policy and path to citizenship should reflect both compassion and fairness: we should protect human dignity, keep families together, and offer a realistic, structured path to legal status for those who contribute to our communities. At the same time, we need secure, orderly borders, clear rules that are enforced consistently, and a system that doesn\u2019t undercut American workers or turn immigration into a political football."

    "original_statement": "Immigration policy should balance compassion with practicality, providing a clear, accessible path to citizenship for people who work hard, follow the law, and contribute to our communities and economy. As someone who works in a globally connected tech field, I see firsthand how immigrants bring vital skills and innovation, and our laws should reflect that reality. We also need due process, humane enforcement, and protections that keep families together while respecting security concerns. Ultimately, our approach should reflect American values of fairness, opportunity, and human dignity."
