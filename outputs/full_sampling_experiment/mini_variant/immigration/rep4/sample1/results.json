      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with a humane, orderly process that recognizes economic needs and family unity; pathways to citizenship should be earned through clear, fair requirements such as background checks, work or service, and demonstrated commitment to civic responsibilities. While people differ on levels of enforcement and speed of naturalization, common ground exists in creating transparent, accountable systems that prioritize public safety, respect human dignity, and integrate newcomers so they can contribute to society.",

Recognizing concerns about borders and rule of law as well as aspirations for opportunity and safety, the path to citizenship should include clear eligibility criteria, accountability measures such as background checks and reasonable waiting periods, and targeted provisions for those with longstanding community ties or humanitarian need.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the nation\u2019s economic and security needs with humanitarian obligations by creating orderly, transparent pathways that prioritize border integrity, timely processing, and fair access to legal migration and asylum. While recognizing concerns about enforcement and cultural cohesion, a pragmatic system can unite families, fill labor market needs, and offer a credible, humane path to citizenship for those who meet clear requirements such as background checks, language and civics competency, and demonstrated contribution to the community."
