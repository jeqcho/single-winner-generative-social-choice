      "Immigration policy should balance national security and economic interests with a commitment to human dignity by enforcing orderly, transparent borders while creating realistic, fair pathways to legal status for those who contribute to society. Recognizing concerns about rule of law and resource strain as well as the moral and economic arguments for inclusion, the path to citizenship should be conditional on background checks, taxes and fees paid, basic civic and language requirements, and a reasonable period of demonstrated contribution. This approach upholds sovereignty and public order while offering accountability and opportunity, fostering social cohesion and economic growth.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with a humane, orderly path to citizenship that recognizes the economic and social contributions of newcomers. It should combine clear, enforceable entry rules and robust vetting with realistic pathways for long-term residents to earn legal status through demonstrated ties to community, work, and respect for obligations, while providing targeted protections for refugees and vulnerable populations. This approach acknowledges legitimate concerns about sovereignty and enforcement while finding common ground in shared values of fairness, opportunity, and national interest.",
