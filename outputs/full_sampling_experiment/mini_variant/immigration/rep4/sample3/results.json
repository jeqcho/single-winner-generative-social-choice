      "Immigration policy should balance a secure, orderly system with compassion, creating clear, fair pathways to citizenship that reward legal compliance, economic contribution, and family unity while protecting public safety and national interests. Recognizing concerns about border integrity and labor market impacts, policies should streamline legal channels, strengthen enforcement where necessary, and provide realistic, humane opportunities for undocumented immigrants to regularize status through background checks, taxes, and community integration requirements. This approach respects rule of law and national sovereignty while acknowledging humanitarian obligations and the economic and cultural contributions of immigrants.",
      "Immigration policy should balance respect for the rule of law and national security with recognition of economic contributions, humanitarian obligations, and the value of family unity, creating clear, fair, and enforceable pathways to lawful status. By combining sensible border and workplace enforcement, timely processing, and accessible but accountable routes to permanent residency and citizenship\u2014including opportunities for integration such as learning the language and meeting civic requirements\u2014policies can honor diverse concerns while treating migrants with dignity and promoting shared economic and social stability.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and rule of law with humanitarian responsibility and economic needs by enforcing fair, transparent procedures, prioritizing efficient processing, and protecting borders while expanding legal pathways for work, family reunification, and refuge. It should provide a clear, attainable path to citizenship for long-term residents who meet background, employment, and civic-integration requirements, paired with enforcement against exploitation and meaningful support for assimilation. By combining orderly enforcement with opportunity and respect for human dignity, this approach acknowledges concerns about sovereignty and resources while recognizing immigrants\u2019 contributions and rights.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with humane, practical pathways to citizenship that recognize immigrants\u2019 economic contributions and family ties. While respecting legitimate concerns about national security and orderly entry, the system should offer clear, achievable criteria for legalization, prioritize timely processing, and include enforcement measures that are fair and transparent. By combining responsible oversight, opportunities for integration, and protections for vulnerable people, policy can uphold sovereignty while reflecting shared values of opportunity and community cohesion.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and the rule of law with humanitarian responsibility and the economic benefits of new arrivals, creating a fair, transparent path to citizenship that rewards lawful behavior, skills, and family unity.  By combining robust border management and timely adjudication with attainable pathways for long-term residents, targeted labor programs, and protections for refugees, policymakers can respect community concerns while upholding human dignity and contributing to shared prosperity."
