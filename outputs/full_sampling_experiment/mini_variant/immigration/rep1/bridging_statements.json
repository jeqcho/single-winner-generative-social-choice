I hear folks calling for secure borders and others asking for compassion and a fair path to citizenship\u2014both matter to me\u2014so let\u2019s craft rules that keep communities safe and stable while giving hardworking families a clear, affordable way to earn citizenship and stay together.",
    "original_statement": "I believe immigration policy should put the safety and economic stability of American citizens first, with strong border security and enforcement of existing laws. At the same time, there should be a fair, orderly path to citizenship for those who follow the rules, work hard, learn English, and truly want to be part of this country. As someone raising kids on a tight budget, I think we need to make sure newcomers aren\u2019t undercutting wages or abusing the system, but are contributing and respecting our values. Compassion matters, but it has to go hand-in-hand with responsibility and respect for our laws."

    "original_statement": "I think immigration rules should be fair and kind, especially to families and children, so people aren\u2019t separated from the people who love them. Since my parents came from Africa and worked hard to give me a safe home, I believe the path to citizenship should reward people who follow the laws, help their communities, and want to be good neighbors. Muslims like my family are taught to care for others, so I think the policy should protect people escaping danger and give them a real chance to belong."
