Recognizing concerns about public safety, economic impact, and cultural cohesion alongside the values of family unity and human dignity, policymakers should craft procedures that are transparent, efficient, and grounded in due process, allowing lawful integration and labor needs while addressing backlogs and irregular arrivals.

Recognizing both concerns about national security and the moral and practical benefits of immigration, the path to citizenship should include clear, attainable criteria\u2014such as background checks, language and civic knowledge, and employment or community ties\u2014combined with efficient processes and protections for vulnerable individuals. This approach honors sovereignty while fostering inclusion, economic growth, and family unity, and it allows for adjustments based on labor needs and public safety data.",

By combining effective border enforcement and interior immigration controls with opportunities for hardworking immigrants to regularize status through background checks, payment of fines or fees, and commitments to learn the language and civic responsibilities, we can uphold the rule of law while strengthening communities and the economy. This approach acknowledges concerns about public safety and rule-following while recognizing the practical and moral benefits of integrating long-term residents who contribute to society.",
