We should have a realistic, well\u2011managed path to citizenship for people who follow the law, work, pay taxes, and contribute to our communities, regardless of where they were born. I want smart systems\u2014using modern technology\u2014to vet applicants thoroughly but efficiently, so we\u2019re protecting public safety while giving people an honest shot. In line with my Christian values and belief in equal opportunity, I think we ought to treat immigrants with dignity while making sure they play by the same rules as everyone else."
