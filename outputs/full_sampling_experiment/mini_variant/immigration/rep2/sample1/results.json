      "Immigration policy should balance national security and the rule of law with compassion and economic pragmatism by enforcing secure, orderly borders while creating realistic, humane pathways to citizenship for long-term residents and high-demand workers. Recognizing concerns about fairness and resource strain, the system should include clear criteria, timely processing, and opportunities for integration\u2014such as language, employment, and civic education\u2014so newcomers contribute and communities adjust. This approach honors both the need to manage immigration responsibly and the values of opportunity and family unity that many hold dear.",

By combining effective enforcement and clear, fair processes for work, family reunification, and asylum with accessible, merit- and need-based routes to citizenship, policymakers can uphold national security and economic interests while honoring humanitarian obligations and social cohesion.",
      "Immigration policy should balance secure borders and rule of law with a fair, humane process that recognizes immigrants' economic contributions and family ties; practical reforms\u2014such as streamlined legal pathways, clear enforcement priorities, and accessible routes to eventual citizenship for those who meet agreed standards\u2014can reduce irregular migration while upholding national interests. By combining reasonable enforcement measures with transparent, efficient avenues for work, family reunification, and integration, policymakers can respect both concerns about sovereignty and the moral and economic case for welcoming newcomers.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the nation's legitimate interest in secure, orderly borders and public safety with a commitment to humane treatment and economic opportunity for newcomers; practical reforms must streamline legal pathways, prioritize fair enforcement, and address labor and humanitarian needs. Recognizing both concerns about rule of law and the contributions immigrants make, a common-sense path to citizenship should combine clear eligibility criteria, responsibilities such as background checks and contribution requirements, and a reasonable timeline that rewards integration and civic participation.

      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and national security with a fair, humane pathway to citizenship that recognizes immigrants' economic contributions and family ties; this means enforcing borders and vetting while providing clear, attainable routes for long-term residents and skilled workers to regularize status. Policies should be pragmatic and predictable\u2014combining reasonable quotas, merit- and family-based considerations, protections for refugees and Dreamers, and robust integration supports like language and job training\u2014to promote social cohesion, economic growth, and respect for human dignity."
