      "Immigration policy should balance a secure, orderly system with a humane, fair path to citizenship that recognizes both national interests and the dignity of migrants. Policies should enforce borders and uphold the rule of law while creating realistic, transparent pathways for work, family reunification, and eventual naturalization, paired with investments in integration, labor protections, and targeted enforcement. This approach honors concerns about sovereignty and public safety while acknowledging economic needs and moral obligations to treat people with respect and opportunity.",
      "Immigration policy should balance a sovereign nation\u2019s right to secure its borders with a humane, orderly process that recognizes economic needs, family unity, and refugee protections; practical reforms should prioritize transparent, fair pathways to legal status and citizenship that include background checks, language and civics requirements, and realistic timelines. While acknowledging concerns about rule of law and resource strain as well as the moral and economic arguments for inclusion, policymakers should pursue bipartisan solutions that restore trust in the system, reduce incentives for irregular migration, and integrate newcomers who contribute to society.",
      "Immigration policy should balance a nation\u2019s need for secure, orderly borders and rule of law with compassion for migrants and recognition of their economic and social contributions, creating realistic pathways to citizenship for those who meet clear requirements. Policies should combine fair, efficient processes\u2014such as background checks, employment or family-based criteria, and opportunities for integration like language and civics education\u2014with protections for vulnerable individuals, fostering both public confidence and humane treatment.",
      "Immigration policy should balance a secure, orderly system with a humane, predictable pathway to citizenship, recognizing the need to protect borders and uphold the rule of law while valuing economic contribution, family unity, and human dignity. Policies should combine realistic enforcement and efficient processing with clear criteria for integration\u2014such as residency, background checks, civic knowledge, and contribution to the community\u2014alongside targeted relief for vulnerable individuals; this approach respects legitimate concerns about security and fairness while offering a practical, compassionate route for those who meet established standards.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and the rule of law with compassion and economic practicality by enforcing borders and orderly processes while providing clear, achievable pathways to citizenship for those who contribute and abide by the rules. Recognizing concerns about jobs and community cohesion as well as the humanitarian and economic benefits of immigration, the approach should include fair vetting, timely processing, support for integration like language and workforce training, and mechanisms to resolve status for long-term residents. This middle-ground framework respects sovereignty, addresses public concerns, and affirms shared obligations to human dignity and opportunity."
