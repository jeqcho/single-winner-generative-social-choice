      "Immigration policy should balance national security and economic needs with compassion and respect for human dignity, creating a fair, orderly system that upholds the rule of law while providing realistic pathways for those who contribute to society to earn permanent status. It should combine firm, transparent enforcement of borders and eligibility rules with practical opportunities for work, family reunification, and eventual citizenship, paired with investments in integration services that support civic and economic participation for newcomers and protect communities. ",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and rule-of-law with compassion and economic pragmatism by enforcing orderly, transparent processes while creating realistic pathways to legal status for those who contribute to our communities. Reasonable reforms should include secure borders, efficient adjudication of applications, and conditional, earned routes to citizenship that protect public safety and labor markets while honoring family unity and humanitarian obligations. This approach recognizes concerns about sovereignty and resource strain while valuing the economic, cultural, and moral benefits of integrating newcomers under clear, fair standards.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and rule of law with humanitarian responsibility and economic needs by enforcing clear, fair rules while creating practical pathways for integration and citizenship. Recognizing concerns about borders and resources as well as the contributions and rights of newcomers, the system should prioritize orderly processing, workforce needs, family unity, and a transparent path to citizenship that includes background checks, civic integration requirements, and opportunities for legal status adjustments. This approach respects differing viewpoints by combining enforcement and accountability with compassion and pragmatic pathways that strengthen communities and the economy.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with a humane, orderly process that recognizes immigrants\u2019 contributions and family ties; practical pathways to citizenship should include clear requirements, fair timelines, and opportunities for integration such as language and civic education. While some will emphasize enforcement and others will prioritize relief for newcomers, most can agree on policies that deter illegal entry, uphold national interests, and provide a manageable, transparent route for those who meet standards to earn full participation in society.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with compassion and opportunity, creating a fair, efficient pathway to citizenship for those who contribute to our communities and economy. By combining realistic enforcement measures, clear timelines and requirements, protections for vulnerable populations, and pathways that prioritize integration through work, language, and civic knowledge, we can honor public concerns about security while upholding values of inclusion and renewal."
