      "Immigration policy should balance the sovereign right to control borders and enforce laws with a humane, orderly system that recognizes immigrants' economic contributions and family ties; this means securing borders and streamlining legal pathways while providing clear, attainable routes to citizenship for long-term residents who meet defined criteria. By combining fair enforcement, investment in efficient processing and integration services, and protections for vulnerable individuals, policy can reflect both respect for rule of law and compassion, honoring national interests while upholding shared values of opportunity and human dignity.",

By combining sensible enforcement and clear, efficient procedures with opportunities for integration\u2014such as work authorization, language and civic education, and a fair, achievable route to citizenship\u2014we can respect national sovereignty, uphold public safety, and honor shared values of opportunity and family unity.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and rule of law with a fair, humane process that recognizes the economic and cultural contributions of newcomers; this means enforcing borders while expanding orderly, merit- and family-based pathways and effective integration programs. A path to citizenship should be earned, transparent, and accessible\u2014combining background checks and obligations (work, taxes, language, civics) with realistic timelines, opportunities for legal status adjustment, and protections for vulnerable populations\u2014so the system is orderly, compassionate, and benefits both immigrants and the host society.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the nation's economic needs, security, and legal integrity with a fair, humane process that recognizes the contributions and dignity of newcomers. By combining effective border enforcement and orderly, merit- and family-based pathways with clear standards for residency and a realistic, earned route to citizenship, we can uphold the rule of law while offering opportunity and integration; policies should include support for workforce needs, respect for human rights, and practical pathways for long-term residents to regularize status. This approach acknowledges concerns about sovereignty and rule-following while addressing humanitarian obligations and the benefits of immigration to communities and the economy.",
      "Immigration policy and the path to citizenship should balance orderly, enforceable borders with fair, humane treatment of migrants, creating clear, timely pathways for legal entry and naturalization that protect national security and economic needs while respecting human dignity. This approach recognizes the importance of upholding the rule of law and community integrity, while also providing pragmatic routes for longtime residents, essential workers, and families to regularize status through transparent criteria, due process, and opportunities for integration and contribution."
