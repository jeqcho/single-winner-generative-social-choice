      "Immigration policy and the path to citizenship should balance national security and rule of law with humane treatment and economic opportunity, creating clear, fair processes that prioritize family unity, worker needs, and integration responsibilities. While recognizing concerns about border integrity and resource limits, policies should provide orderly legal pathways, reasonable timelines for naturalization, and support for language, employment, and civic education to ensure newcomers contribute and fully participate in society.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and orderly borders with compassion and opportunity, creating a fair, transparent path to citizenship that prioritizes public safety, economic needs, and family unity. By combining effective border management and enforcement with clear, attainable requirements for legal status, expedited processing for high-need workers, and humane protection for refugees and long-standing community members, policymakers can respect diverse concerns while strengthening social cohesion and economic vitality.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and orderly processes with a humane, practical pathway to citizenship that recognizes economic needs, family unity, and humanitarian obligations. By combining secure, enforceable borders and clear legal avenues for work and residency with fair, transparent criteria for naturalization and targeted relief for long-standing contributors, we can uphold national sovereignty while integrating newcomers who strengthen communities and the economy.",
      "Immigration policy should balance the rule of law and secure borders with humane, practical pathways to work and citizenship that recognize migrants\u2019 contributions and family ties. Policies ought to combine clear, enforceable procedures and fair, timely adjudication with opportunities for legal migration, labor mobility, and regularization for long-term residents, while investing in integration services and addressing root causes abroad. This approach respects national sovereignty and community safety while honoring shared values of fairness, economic vitality, and human dignity, and it incorporates safeguards to adapt to changing needs and to deter exploitation and illegal entry.",
      "Immigration policy should balance national security and rule of law with compassion and economic pragmatism by enforcing borders and orderly procedures while providing realistic, humane pathways to citizenship for those who contribute and integrate. Recognizing concerns about jobs and public resources as well as the moral and economic benefits of immigration, the path to citizenship should include background checks, language and civics requirements, truthfully enforced timelines, and opportunities for work and family reunification to promote stability and shared prosperity."
