      "We should rebuild public trust in institutions by combining transparent, accountable decision-making with measurable performance and meaningful public participation. This approach recognizes legitimate concerns from both reformers\u2014who demand openness and redress for failures\u2014and defenders of institutional stability\u2014who value expertise and continuity\u2014by ensuring independent oversight, clear standards, and accessible explanations of policies and outcomes. Prioritizing fairness, anti\u2011corruption safeguards, and ongoing civic education will help institutions be both competent and responsive to the communities they serve.",
      "We should rebuild trust by increasing transparency, accountability, and responsiveness so institutions consistently demonstrate they serve the public interest. This requires independent oversight, clear communication of evidence-based decisions, and meaningful avenues for public participation that respect diverse values and legitimate concerns about bias and corruption. Combining stronger ethics and performance standards with community engagement and protections for nonpartisan expertise can create institutions that are both effective and trusted by a broad cross-section of society.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and independent accountability with meaningful public engagement and clear, measurable performance standards. This middle-ground approach acknowledges both widespread skepticism about concentrated power and the legitimate need for expertise by committing to open decision-making, protections for whistleblowers, independent audits, and accessible communication about goals and outcomes. Prioritizing inclusivity, data privacy, and regular opportunities for community input can help institutions be both trustworthy and effective.",
      "To increase public trust, institutions should commit to transparent decision-making, independent oversight, and consistent accountability while also inviting meaningful community input and safeguarding expertise. This balanced approach recognizes both calls for reform and skepticism of concentrated power as well as the legitimate need for competent, reliable institutions that deliver results. By combining clearer communication, accessible participation channels, and measurable performance standards, institutions can rebuild confidence across diverse communities.",
      "To rebuild public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to transparent decision-making, independent accountability, and consistent responsiveness while preserving expertise and rule-based governance. Different perspectives\u2014from those demanding major reforms to those emphasizing stability and competence\u2014can be reconciled through open data, routine independent audits, clear plain-language explanations of policies, and meaningful channels for citizen input and redress. By combining stronger checks on power with better communication and accessible public services, institutions can demonstrate the fairness, effectiveness, and integrity that most people can accept."
