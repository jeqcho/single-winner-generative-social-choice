I think we need stronger voter ID laws, strict chain-of-custody rules for ballots, and regular, independent audits so people know every legal vote is counted and only legal votes are counted. We should also do a much better job explaining these processes to the public in plain language, and keep politics out of how elections are run as much as possible.
