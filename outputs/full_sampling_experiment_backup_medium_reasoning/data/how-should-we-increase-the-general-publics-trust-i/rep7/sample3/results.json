      "To increase the public's trust in institutions, leaders and organizations should commit to greater transparency, independent accountability, and consistent delivery of fair, evidence-based services while actively engaging and listening to communities with differing views. This includes publishing clear information, strengthening oversight and anti-corruption measures, protecting a free and accurate information environment, and creating meaningful channels for public participation and feedback. By measuring outcomes, correcting mistakes openly, and prioritizing equitable results, institutions can build credibility across political and social divides.",
      "To rebuild public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and independent accountability with practical reforms that protect expertise, limit conflicts of interest, and ensure fair, consistent enforcement of rules. These steps should be paired with accessible two\u2011way communication, meaningful community participation in decision\u2011making, and regular independently verified performance reporting so people across the political spectrum can see results. By committing to measurable standards, nonpartisan oversight, and opportunities for public input, institutions can demonstrate competence and integrity while respecting legitimate calls for change.",
      "We can increase public trust in institutions by committing to transparent decision-making, consistent accountability, and active engagement with diverse communities. While some prioritize stronger oversight and others emphasize protecting institutional independence, both perspectives converge on the need for clear rules, accessible information, and meaningful avenues for public input. By combining independent review, routine disclosure of evidence and outcomes, and inclusive channels for feedback and civic education, institutions can rebuild credibility while maintaining effectiveness.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pair greater transparency and independent accountability with demonstrable improvements in service quality, fairness, and responsiveness so institutions are both open and effective. This balances the legitimate demand for reform and oversight from critics with the need for stability and expertise emphasized by supporters, while creating clear avenues for meaningful public participation. Committing to independent review, measurable performance standards, and regular, plain-language reporting can rebuild legitimacy across diverse communities.",
      "People hold different views of institutions\u2014some see them as essential guarantors of stability and expertise, others as distant or unaccountable\u2014but we can find common ground by committing institutions to greater transparency, accountable decision\u2011making, and consistent delivery of public goods. Practical, bipartisan steps include independent oversight, clear performance metrics and open data, protected channels for whistleblowers, and routine community engagement to ensure policies are equitable and responsive. By publicly measuring progress and fostering respectful cross\u2011partisan dialogue, institutions can rebuild legitimacy while preserving expertise and the rule of law."
