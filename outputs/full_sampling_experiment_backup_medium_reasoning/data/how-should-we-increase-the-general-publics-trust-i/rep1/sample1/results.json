      "To rebuild public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and independent accountability with meaningful public participation and consistent delivery of high-quality services; institutions must openly share decision-making processes, data, and outcomes while welcoming diverse input and oversight. This balanced approach respects the value of expert-driven, evidence-based policy and the public\u2019s demand for fairness and responsiveness, ensuring institutions are both competent and answerable to the people they serve.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine greater transparency and independent accountability with tangible improvements in service delivery so people can see results. Institutions must commit to clear, honest communication, robust oversight, and meaningful opportunities for community input and representation to address concerns across the political spectrum. By protecting rights, combating misinformation, and demonstrating consistent competence and ethical behavior, institutions can rebuild legitimacy while preserving necessary expertise and stability.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine greater transparency and accountability with strong protections for independence and expertise, while creating clear, meaningful channels for public input and oversight. This approach recognizes both the need to reform practices that breed distrust and the need to preserve stable, competent institutions that deliver results, committing to regular measurement and open reporting of performance. By balancing institutional integrity with responsiveness and inclusive engagement, we can rebuild confidence across diverse communities.",
      "To rebuild public trust in institutions, leaders should combine transparent decision-making, independent accountability mechanisms, and consistent ethical behavior with open, accessible communication and genuine public engagement. While some emphasize the need for rapid reform and others stress stability and expertise, most can agree that institutions earn trust by demonstrating competence, correcting mistakes, and making measurable commitments to fairness and responsiveness.",
      "We should rebuild trust by making institutions more transparent, accountable, responsive, and inclusive, combining independent oversight and clear performance metrics with open communication and genuine community participation. This balances calls for reform and concerns about preserving expertise: by implementing evidence-based improvements, diverse representation, and accessible mechanisms for feedback and redress, institutions can demonstrate reliability and earn broad public confidence."
