      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should pursue a balanced approach that pairs greater transparency and independent accountability with meaningful public participation, while safeguarding privacy and operational effectiveness. Institutions can build credibility by publishing accessible information, establishing impartial oversight, and demonstrating responsiveness through measurable outcomes. This recognizes concerns about bureaucracy and security yet finds common ground around openness, fairness, and results-driven stewardship.",
      "To rebuild and sustain public trust in institutions, they should combine clear transparency about decision-making and outcomes with robust accountability mechanisms and independent oversight so people can see rules are applied fairly and mistakes are corrected. At the same time, institutions should actively engage diverse communities through meaningful participation, accessible communication, and demonstrated competence in delivering services, balancing needed reform with respect for stable procedures to avoid politicization. These steps\u2014transparency, accountability, public engagement, and impartial safeguards\u2014acknowledge valid concerns about corruption or overreach while preserving institutions\u2019 capacity to act effectively for the common good.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and accountability measures with protections for independent expertise and meaningful community oversight, recognizing the need for both professional competence and democratic input. Institutions should commit to clear, timely communication, accessible data, independent audits, and regular stakeholder engagement to address legitimate concerns about bias, responsiveness, and power imbalances.",
      "To rebuild public trust in institutions, we should pursue a balanced approach that pairs stronger transparency, independent accountability, and measurable performance with protections for institutional expertise and operational independence. This means clear, accessible reporting, independent oversight, and routine public engagement so citizens can see results and hold institutions to common standards; reforms should be evidence-based, guard against political interference, and address inequities to deliver fair outcomes for all.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, leaders across government, business, media, and civil society should commit to consistent transparency, independent oversight, and clear accountability while delivering dependable, evidence\u2011based outcomes. This approach balances calls for reform and protections against politicization by inviting regular public engagement, safeguarding impartial processes, and improving communication so institutions are both responsive to legitimate concerns and resilient in fulfilling their duties."
