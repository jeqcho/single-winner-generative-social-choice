      "Although people disagree about how much authority institutions should hold, most want them to be honest, accountable, and responsive to ordinary citizens. To build that trust, institutions should combine transparent decision-making, independent oversight, clear communication, and opportunities for meaningful public participation with robust safeguards against corruption and abuse. This balanced approach respects both the need for effective public action and the public\u2019s demand for democratic control and integrity.",
      "To rebuild and increase public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and accountability measures with practical reforms that improve service delivery and responsiveness while protecting institutional independence and the rule of law. This balanced approach acknowledges calls for both greater oversight and stability by committing to clear communication, independent oversight, inclusive decision\u2011making, civic education, and measurable outcomes the public can evaluate.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and accountability measures with sustained investment in institutional capacity and service delivery so institutions are both open and effective. This requires independent oversight, clearer communication of decisions and evidence, protection of impartial expertise, and meaningful avenues for public input and participation so people see both fairness and responsiveness. By balancing oversight and competence, addressing corruption and inequality, and committing to inclusive representation and civic education, institutions can earn legitimacy across diverse perspectives.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, leaders should prioritize transparency, independent accountability, and consistent delivery of fair, evidence-based services while protecting institutions from undue political influence. At the same time institutions should open meaningful channels for public participation and feedback, invest in clear, accessible communication, and support civic education to counter misinformation. By combining competent, accountable administration with inclusive engagement and oversight, we can build a baseline of trust that respects both expert guidance and democratic input.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to transparent decision-making, clear accountability mechanisms, and regular, accessible communication that invites citizen input. This approach balances the need for effective action and stability with the demand for independent oversight, ethical conduct, and efforts to combat corruption and misinformation by combining timely responsiveness with audits, community engagement, and protections for impartial information. Investing in civic education and demonstrating consistent, equitable behavior will help institutions rebuild credibility while remaining attentive to diverse public concerns."
