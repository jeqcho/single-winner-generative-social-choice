      "To rebuild and increase public trust in institutions, leaders should combine clear, consistent transparency and accountable performance with meaningful opportunities for public participation and independent oversight. This approach recognizes the need both for expert-driven standards and for ordinary people's voice and experience, addressing concerns about competence, bias, and corruption. By committing to better communication, measurable results, and inclusive decision-making, institutions can demonstrate they serve the common good and earn broad-based confidence.",
      "While people may distrust institutions for different reasons\u2014perceived lack of transparency, failure to deliver services, or fears of bias\u2014most agree that institutions must earn legitimacy through consistent competence and fairness. A practical path forward is to combine stronger transparency and independent oversight with clearer two-way communication, meaningful public participation, and enforceable accountability measures so institutions are both competent and responsive to the communities they serve.",
      "To rebuild and increase the public's trust in institutions, leaders should commit to transparent decision-making, independent oversight, and consistent, measurable performance that delivers fair outcomes for all communities. While some prioritize preserving institutional stability and others call for significant reform, both perspectives can agree on strengthening accountability, improving communication, and meaningfully involving the public in policy development. By demonstrating competence, integrity, and responsiveness\u2014and by measuring and reporting progress openly\u2014institutions can earn and sustain broader public confidence.",
      "We should rebuild public trust in institutions by committing to transparent decision-making, consistent accountability, and meaningful public engagement. This approach balances the need for independent, expert-driven action with stronger oversight, anti-corruption safeguards, accessible communication, and civic education so people from different backgrounds can understand and influence how institutions operate. By combining institutional integrity with responsiveness to community needs, we can create organizations that are both competent and legitimate in the eyes of diverse citizens.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, leaders should commit to transparent, accountable decision-making and meaningful public engagement while upholding evidence-based expertise. Institutions should also address legitimate concerns about bias and responsiveness by adopting independent oversight, clear and accessible communication, and regular opportunities for community input. These measures balance the need for competent, informed action with the public's demand for fairness and participation."
