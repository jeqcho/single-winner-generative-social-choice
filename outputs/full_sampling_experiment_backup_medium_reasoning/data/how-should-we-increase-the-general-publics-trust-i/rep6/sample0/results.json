      "While some people emphasize stronger oversight and others stress institutional independence and efficiency, most agree trust increases when institutions are competent, fair, and accountable. To bridge these views, institutions should improve transparency, openly correct mistakes, invite meaningful community participation, and support independent oversight and clear performance metrics. At the same time, citizens, media, and civil society should engage responsibly and prioritize verified information so that collaborative oversight and better communication can rebuild public confidence.",
      "To increase public trust in institutions, we should combine greater transparency and accountability with genuine public engagement so decisions are understandable, evidence-based, and responsive to community needs. This approach respects the need for competent expertise and stable institutions while addressing legitimate demands for oversight, ethical conduct, and protection of individual rights. Practical measures\u2014clear reporting, independent oversight, accessible civic education, and regular dialogue with diverse communities\u2014can bridge divides and build measurable, long-term confidence.",

By committing to clear communication, equitable treatment, and shared oversight, diverse stakeholders can find common ground between demands for reform and the need for effective, reliable governance.",

By combining measurable performance metrics, accessible reporting, and meaningful channels for community input, institutions can rebuild legitimacy in a way that balances integrity, effectiveness, and democratic responsiveness.",
