      "To increase public trust in institutions, leaders and institutions should commit to transparent, accountable decision-making, regular evidence-based reporting, and meaningful public participation alongside independent oversight. Institutions must demonstrate fairness and competence by enforcing anti-corruption safeguards, protecting impartial expertise, and promptly correcting mistakes while taking legitimate concerns about bias and access seriously. By combining clearer communication, measurable performance standards, and accessible avenues for citizen input and redress, diverse constituencies can find common ground in trusting institutions that both deliver results and remain answerable to the people they serve.",
      "To increase public trust, institutions should commit to consistent transparency, independent accountability, and meaningful public participation\u2014balancing demands for openness and oversight with the need for expert, stable decision-making. Practical steps include clear, accessible communication, robust anti-corruption safeguards, protection of rights and privacy, and regular channels for community input so policies reflect diverse needs. By combining evidence-based practice with genuine engagement and tangible accountability, institutions can earn broad-based confidence without sacrificing effectiveness.",
      "We can increase public trust in institutions by combining stronger transparency, independent oversight, and clear accountability with genuine opportunities for public participation and responsive service. This approach recognizes both legitimate concerns about concentrated power and the need to preserve expert capacity and rule-based processes, seeking reforms that make institutions more open, fair, and effective rather than simply dismantling or deferring to them. By committing to measurable standards, accessible communication, and regular community engagement, institutions can rebuild credibility while protecting competence and the common good.",
      "To rebuild and increase public trust in institutions, we should combine stronger transparency and accountability with respect for expertise and institutional independence, while ensuring institutions consistently deliver fair, effective services. This requires clearer, timely communication, meaningful avenues for public participation and oversight, enforceable anti-corruption safeguards, and open performance metrics so citizens across the spectrum can see tangible results. At the same time, institutions should guard against politicization and misinformation by upholding impartial processes and supporting accessible civic education.",
      "To rebuild public trust in institutions, leaders and organizations should commit to transparent decision-making, independent accountability, and meaningful public engagement so that outcomes and trade-offs are clear and verifiable. This approach balances calls for reform and for stability by combining rigorous oversight and evidence-based policies with protections for individual rights and accessible channels for community input. Clear, regular communication and measurable performance indicators will help diverse communities see progress and hold institutions accountable."
