      "Preventing littering in public spaces works best through a balanced mix of accessible infrastructure (well-placed bins and regular collection), clear signage and education to shift social norms, and proportionate enforcement that targets repeat offenders. This approach acknowledges that some people prioritize personal responsibility while others want stronger government or business action, and it finds common ground by emphasizing convenience, community engagement, and accountability. When implemented equitably and with public input, these combined measures can reduce litter without imposing undue burdens.",
      "A balanced approach that most can accept combines accessible, well-maintained waste infrastructure and behavior-change education with proportionate enforcement targeted at repeat offenders and problem locations. It recognizes concerns about over-policing and cost by prioritizing convenient disposal, community-led stewardship, producer responsibility, and incentives for proper disposal while reserving fines as a last resort. Policies should be evidence-based, monitored for equity and effectiveness, and adapted over time based on local data and community input.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced, evidence-based mix of accessible waste infrastructure, public education, and fair, targeted enforcement\u2014complemented by incentives, producer responsibility, and community stewardship. This approach recognizes that some prioritize strict penalties while others emphasize behavior change, and finds common ground by prioritizing convenience and equity, tailoring solutions to local conditions, involving businesses and residents, and regularly evaluating results to refine policy.",
      "To reduce littering in public spaces, communities should adopt a balanced approach that combines public education, easily accessible waste and recycling infrastructure, and fair, consistently applied enforcement. This respects concerns about personal responsibility and the need for effective deterrents while recognizing barriers like lack of facilities or social supports that require investment and targeted outreach. Policies should be evidence-based, include incentives for good behavior, engage local stakeholders, and ensure equitable application so that benefits and burdens are shared fairly.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced approach that combines convenient, well-maintained disposal infrastructure and clear, consistently enforced rules with public education and community stewardship programs. This strategy respects differing views\u2014recognizing individual responsibility, the role of effective design and access, and the need for proportionate enforcement\u2014while prioritizing cost-effective, evidence-based measures such as strategically placed bins, signage, targeted fines, and local volunteer engagement. By blending prevention, facilitation, and fair accountability, communities can reduce litter while building shared ownership of public spaces."
