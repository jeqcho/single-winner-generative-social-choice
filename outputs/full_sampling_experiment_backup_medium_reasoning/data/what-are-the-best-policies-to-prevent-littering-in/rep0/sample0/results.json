      "Reducing litter in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced mix of accessible, well-maintained waste and recycling infrastructure, clear public education and community-led cleanup efforts, and fair, targeted enforcement for repeat or egregious offenders. This approach respects concerns about individual freedom and public budgets by prioritizing prevention, partnerships with businesses and producers to reduce unnecessary packaging, and community engagement, while retaining proportionate penalties as a deterrent. Coordinating these elements creates an equitable, cost-effective strategy that addresses both immediate cleanup needs and the upstream causes of litter.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced strategy that combines accessible, well\u2011maintained waste and recycling infrastructure, public education and community engagement, and proportionate enforcement. This approach recognizes concerns about government overreach by emphasizing incentives and outreach while also addressing calls for accountability through fair, clearly communicated fines and cleanup requirements. By funding durable trash solutions, involving local stakeholders, and applying enforcement equitably, communities can reduce litter while respecting diverse values and practical constraints.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces is best approached through a balanced mix of measures that respect different views: combine convenient, well-maintained waste and recycling infrastructure and design with positive education and outreach, proportionate enforcement and incentives, and clear business and producer responsibility. Policies should be locally tailored and equitable\u2014using data to target hotspots, offering alternatives to fines (e.g., community service or education) where appropriate, and ensuring consistent funding for collection and maintenance. Coordinated action by governments, community groups and businesses, together with regular evaluation, can build public buy-in and reduce litter sustainably.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best through a balanced mix of measures: accessible, well-maintained waste and recycling infrastructure, public education and incentives that encourage responsible behavior, and fair, transparent enforcement focused on repeat or egregious violations. This approach respects individual responsibility and concerns about government overreach while recognizing the public cost of litter and the need for community involvement and targeted investment to keep spaces clean and welcoming for everyone.",
      "We can most effectively reduce littering by combining accessible, well-maintained waste and recycling infrastructure with consistent, proportionate enforcement and public education that emphasizes civic pride and convenience. Policies should be data-driven and equitable\u2014prioritizing prevention through design, public\u2013private partnerships and incentives (such as deposit-return systems), regular maintenance, and community stewardship rather than heavy-handed criminalization. This blended approach respects concerns about cost and personal responsibility while delivering measurable reductions in litter and cleaner, safer public spaces."
