      "While people differ on whether education, infrastructure, or stricter enforcement is the best remedy, most agree that littering harms community health and aesthetics and that solutions should be fair and effective. A balanced policy combines convenient, well-maintained waste and recycling receptacles, clear signage and public education, targeted enforcement with proportionate fines whose revenues support cleanup and prevention, and incentives for businesses to reduce disposable packaging. Implementing these measures on a data-driven, community-informed basis and regularly evaluating outcomes can build broad support while keeping costs reasonable and respecting individual rights.",
      "Preventing littering in public spaces is best achieved through a balanced, evidence-based mix of accessible waste infrastructure, public education, and proportionate enforcement. This approach acknowledges differing views\u2014individual responsibility, budget constraints, and concerns about over-policing\u2014by prioritizing well-placed bins, regular maintenance, outreach and incentives, and reserving fines for repeat or egregious offenders. Policies should be tailored to local conditions, evaluated for effectiveness, and developed in partnership with residents, businesses, and environmental groups to ensure fairness and lasting results.",
      "While some stakeholders prioritize strict enforcement and fines and others emphasize education, infrastructure, and community engagement, a pragmatic consensus recognizes that both individual behavior and systemic design matter. Effective policy packages combine accessible, well-placed waste and recycling receptacles, clear signage and public education, incentives such as deposit-return schemes, and proportionate enforcement focused on repeat or egregious violators. These measures should be evidence-based, locally tailored, adequately funded, and implemented fairly to avoid disproportionate impacts while being regularly evaluated for effectiveness.",
      "Preventing litter in public spaces works best through a balanced approach that pairs fair, consistently applied enforcement of anti-litter rules with plentiful, well\u2011maintained waste and recycling infrastructure and ongoing public education. This recognizes both the need for accountability and the practical reality that people are more likely to dispose of trash properly when options are convenient, social norms reinforce cleanliness, and businesses and community groups are engaged. Policies should be tailored to local needs and regularly evaluated so they remain equitable, effective, and broadly supported.",
      "To reduce littering in public spaces, cities should adopt a balanced strategy that combines readily accessible waste and recycling bins, evidence-based public education, and proportionate enforcement. This approach respects those who emphasize personal responsibility and those who call for systemic solutions by pairing infrastructure and outreach with fair, transparent penalties and positive incentives. Engaging local communities in design and stewardship helps ensure measures are cost-effective, culturally appropriate, and minimize disproportionate impacts on vulnerable groups while promoting sustained behavior change."
