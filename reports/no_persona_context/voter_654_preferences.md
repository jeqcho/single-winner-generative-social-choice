## Statements (Most to Least Preferred)

### 1. Statement 24 (Score: 99)
A workable approach to abortion law balances liberty with responsibility: protect early access to safe care, and ensure later-pregnancy regulations are narrowly tailored, medically grounded, and include strong health and trauma exceptions. People disagree about when life begins, but many agree no one should be forced into dangerous outcomes or abandoned without support. Pairing any legal framework with prevention and family resources can reduce unwanted pregnancies and strengthen trust across divides.

### 2. Statement 36 (Score: 98)
Abortion law should be guided less by punishment and more by the goals most people share—safer pregnancies, fewer desperate choices, and respect for conscience in a plural society. That means protecting the patient–doctor relationship and ensuring prompt treatment for life- and health-threatening situations, while allowing democratically set guardrails that are medically precise and humane. Pairing any legal framework with contraception, sex education, and real economic and childcare support can reduce abortions without forcing one moral view on everyone.

### 3. Statement 28 (Score: 97)
Abortion policy should be written with humility about complex pregnancies and with clarity that doctors must be able to act quickly to protect life and long-term health. At the same time, it can reflect moral concerns by favoring prevention and support over punishment—broad contraception access, comprehensive sex education, prenatal and postpartum care, and economic help for families. Common ground grows when law focuses on safety, fewer unwanted pregnancies, and real care for children and parents after birth.

### 4. Statement 81 (Score: 96)
Laws on abortion should aim to reduce harm by keeping urgent medical decisions in the hands of patients and clinicians, while also recognizing the moral seriousness many attach to developing life. That means clear, evidence-based rules with strong health-and-life exceptions and no criminalization of people in crisis, alongside transparent standards that communities can understand and hold accountable. Common ground grows when policy invests as much in preventing unintended pregnancy and supporting families—through contraception, education, healthcare, and childcare—as it does in debating limits.

### 5. Statement 20 (Score: 95)
Laws on abortion should be grounded in medical reality and human dignity, recognizing both the pregnant person’s need for timely, safe care and the moral seriousness many attach to developing life. A durable framework protects privacy and clinician judgment—especially in emergencies—while setting clear, workable standards that avoid criminalizing people in crisis. Common ground grows when policy also invests in prevention and support: contraception, honest education, prenatal care, and practical help for parenting and adoption.

### 6. Statement 83 (Score: 94)
Laws concerning abortion should prioritize safety, privacy, and medical evidence, while making room for the deep moral convictions that lead many to want stronger protections for unborn life. A practical path is clear guardrails that protect early care and emergency treatment without delay, paired with narrowly tailored, enforceable limits later in pregnancy that include robust exceptions for health risks and traumatic circumstances. Agreement becomes easier when the law also commits to prevention and support—contraception access, sex education, prenatal care, adoption services, and help for parents.

### 7. Statement 69 (Score: 93)
Laws on abortion should be guided by a pluralistic ethic: no single moral or religious view should control everyone’s healthcare, but society can still express care for developing life. The best path is medically grounded legislation that safeguards autonomy and privacy, guarantees prompt care in emergencies, and defines any restrictions clearly enough for doctors to follow without fear. Broad investments in contraception, comprehensive education, and support for parents and adoption can unite people around prevention and shared responsibility.

### 8. Statement 72 (Score: 92)
Laws concerning abortion should reflect both bodily autonomy and the widely felt duty to treat developing life with moral seriousness, without letting politics replace medical judgment. The clearest shared line is that emergencies and serious health risks must be met with timely care, and that rules should be plain enough for doctors and families to understand. Beyond the legal boundary, society should work to make abortion rarer through contraception, education, and strong supports for parenting and adoption.

### 9. Statement 32 (Score: 91)
Laws concerning abortion should balance two widely held convictions: no one should be forced into dangerous medical outcomes, and potential life should not be treated as morally trivial. The most stable approach sets clear, clinically defined protections and emergency exceptions, avoids criminalizing patients and doctors, and relies on prevention through contraception and honest education. Pairing any legal framework with strong support for parents, babies, and families makes room for conscience while reducing harm.

### 10. Statement 9 (Score: 90)
Laws on abortion should be guided by humility about complex cases and a commitment to outcomes that protect both lives and liberties. A common-ground framework defers to medical expertise in emergencies, provides early and safe access where legal, and sets any later restrictions with precise health exceptions and due process. Pairing the law with robust support for parents, adoption, and pregnancy prevention makes it more humane and less divisive.

### 11. Statement 14 (Score: 89)
Abortion policy should be shaped less by slogans and more by outcomes—protecting patient safety, medical judgment, and fairness, while recognizing the ethical gravity many attach to ending a pregnancy. Clear rules should guarantee emergency and severe-complication care, avoid punitive approaches that deter doctors, and provide room for conscience without imposing one doctrine on everyone. The most shared solution is prevention and support: better education, affordable contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, and practical help for families who choose to parent or place a child for adoption.

### 12. Statement 98 (Score: 88)
Abortion policy should be built for real life, not slogans: protect women’s health, give clinicians clear rules in emergencies, and treat families with dignity rather than suspicion. It can also acknowledge moral concern for developing life through transparent, stage-based standards that include strong exceptions and avoid criminal penalties for patients. Investing in contraception, comprehensive sex education, and meaningful supports for parenting and adoption offers common ground by reducing unintended pregnancies and strengthening families.

### 13. Statement 91 (Score: 87)
Laws on abortion should be guided by humility about moral disagreement and by medical reality, recognizing both bodily autonomy and the widely shared desire to protect potential life where possible. That means clear standards that keep urgent decisions in the patient–clinician relationship, include firm health and life exceptions, and avoid vague rules that chill necessary care. The most constructive policy also invests heavily in prevention and support—education, contraception, prenatal care, childcare, and adoption services—so fewer people face the decision under duress.

### 14. Statement 45 (Score: 86)
Laws on abortion should be shaped by medical evidence and the realities families and clinicians face, while treating both potential life and the health and dignity of the pregnant person as morally serious.

Common ground grows when policy also expands prenatal care, adoption support, and economic help so fewer people feel forced into a crisis choice.

### 15. Statement 43 (Score: 85)
Laws concerning abortion should be guided by compassion and clarity: protect the pregnant person’s health and dignity, acknowledge the moral gravity many attach to fetal life, and avoid vague standards that paralyze doctors in emergencies. A stable approach keeps early, time-sensitive decisions primarily between patient and clinician, sets transparent protections for later complex cases, and rejects blanket criminalization. The strongest common ground is prevention and support—education, contraception, healthcare, and resources for parenting and adoption—so choices are less coerced by hardship.

### 16. Statement 12 (Score: 84)
Abortion law should be guided by humility in a pluralistic society: people disagree profoundly about moral status, but most agree no one should be forced into danger, secrecy, or desperation. That means protecting timely medical care and privacy, writing any limits with precise health exceptions and clinician clarity, and focusing enforcement away from criminal punishment. Durable policy also tackles root causes by expanding education, contraception access, and concrete economic and family supports that make carrying a pregnancy feel possible.

### 17. Statement 82 (Score: 83)
Abortion law should be guided by a commitment to human dignity on all sides: respect for bodily autonomy, sincere concern for prenatal life, and the reality that pregnancies can turn medically or personally devastating. A stable compromise protects safe access early, guarantees clinicians the freedom to act in emergencies, and sets any later restrictions only with plainly written, medically workable exceptions for health, severe fetal conditions, and pregnancies from rape or incest. The most durable approach also expands contraception, comprehensive education, and economic and caregiving supports so fewer people are forced into desperate decisions.

### 18. Statement 29 (Score: 82)
Laws concerning abortion should reflect two widely shared principles: no one should be forced into dangerous medical situations, and society should work to make abortions rarer by reducing crisis pregnancies. That means centering evidence-based medical standards and clear emergency protections, while also expanding the social supports—healthcare, housing stability, childcare, and adoption options—that make carrying a pregnancy and raising a child genuinely feasible. A policy built around prevention, safety, and compassion can honor conscience on both sides.

### 19. Statement 4 (Score: 81)
Laws on abortion should aim for fewer tragedies rather than louder victories by centering public health, family well-being, and respect for conscience. That includes protecting timely medical care, especially in emergencies, while setting predictable standards that do not criminalize people in crisis. The strongest shared strategy is prevention and support: comprehensive education, accessible contraception, and long-term resources that make parenting or adoption genuinely feasible.

### 20. Statement 8 (Score: 80)
Abortion policy should start from what many share: safeguarding the health of the pregnant person, treating potential life with moral seriousness, and preventing desperation. Clear medical exceptions and workable clinician standards can coexist with democratically set limits that do not criminalize patients. Investing in contraception, accurate education, prenatal care, and economic support for families helps reduce abortions without forcing one belief system on everyone.

Broad agreement is most likely when policy also reduces crisis pregnancies through contraception access, honest sex education, and strong support for parents and children.

### 24. Statement 38 (Score: 76)
Abortion policy should aim for practical compassion—protecting women from medical harm and coercion while acknowledging that ending a pregnancy carries moral weight for many communities. Any rules should be clear enough for clinicians to follow, include firm protections for emergencies, and avoid turning private crises into prosecutions. Broad agreement is most achievable when government also invests in prevention and family stability through contraception access, honest education, healthcare, and support for children after birth.

### 25. Statement 76 (Score: 75)
Abortion law should be guided by two widely held values at once: protecting the health and freedom of the pregnant person and treating developing life with moral seriousness. That points toward clear, clinically grounded rules with real exceptions for life and health threats, rape, and severe fetal complications, written so doctors can act without fear and patients are not punished. Common ground grows when the same laws invest in prevention—education and contraception—and in practical help for families who choose to carry to term.

### 26. Statement 88 (Score: 74)
Good abortion policy should aim to reduce harm rather than win a moral argument, protecting patients and clinicians in urgent situations while treating the choice with moral seriousness.

The strongest common ground is prevention and support—contraception, education, prenatal care, and resources that make parenting or adoption genuinely feasible.

### 67. Statement 53 (Score: 33)
Good abortion policy should treat this as a serious ethical question in a pluralistic society: uphold bodily autonomy and patient privacy, but also recognize the genuine moral convictions that lead many to want stronger protections for unborn life. The law should be written so clinicians can act quickly in medical crises, and so no one is coerced—by the state, partners, or poverty—into an outcome. The widest agreement lies in prevention and support: fewer unintended pregnancies through education and contraception, and stronger resources for parents and children after birth.

### 68. Statement 64 (Score: 32)
Laws on abortion should be guided by compassion and accountability—respecting private medical decision-making while taking seriously society’s interest in protecting developing life. Clear, medically defined rules with robust exceptions for threats to life or health, rape or incest, and grave fetal diagnoses can reduce confusion and prevent avoidable suffering. Lasting agreement is more likely when policy also focuses on prevention and support: comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and strong resources for families before and after birth.

### 69. Statement 93 (Score: 31)
Laws concerning abortion should be guided by evidence-based healthcare and by respect for conscience in a pluralistic society, ensuring no one is forced into unsafe outcomes and no single moral doctrine is imposed on everyone. Clear rules should protect privacy, let doctors act promptly in emergencies, and draw any gestational boundaries in ways that are medically coherent and plainly written. Shared progress is most likely when lawmakers also prioritize prevention and family stability—contraception, honest education, prenatal care, and economic supports—so fewer pregnancies become crises.

### 70. Statement 61 (Score: 30)
Abortion law should start from shared duties: protect women’s safety, treat developing life with moral seriousness, and keep rules simple enough to follow in real clinics and real families. That points toward preserving patient–doctor decision-making with clear health exceptions, and avoiding policies that criminalize people in crisis or rely on vague language. Common ground grows when legislation also invests in prevention and long-term support—contraception access, sex education, prenatal and postpartum care, childcare, and adoption resources.

### 71. Statement 46 (Score: 29)
Abortion law should aim to reduce suffering rather than score victories, grounding rules in clinical expertise, privacy, and predictable standards that doctors can follow in real emergencies. It can acknowledge deep disagreement about fetal moral status by combining early access and strong health exceptions with carefully defined guardrails later in pregnancy. The most durable compromise also invests in contraception, prenatal care, parental leave, and adoption services so people have genuine options and fewer unintended pregnancies occur.

### 72. Statement 49 (Score: 28)
Laws on abortion should reflect two widely held concerns at once: that people deserve control over their own bodies and that ending a pregnancy carries moral gravity for many communities. The goal should be clear medical standards with strong protections for life- and health-threatening situations, paired with policies that prevent unwanted pregnancies and support families who carry to term. When prevention, healthcare, and practical help lead, the law can reduce harm and make room for conscience without imposing one belief on everyone.

### 73. Statement 27 (Score: 27)
Laws on abortion should aim to minimize harm by safeguarding patient health, privacy, and informed consent while acknowledging that many citizens see fetal life as morally significant. A durable compromise emphasizes early access and clinician-led decision-making, allows narrowly tailored regulations later in pregnancy with robust health exceptions, and expands resources that prevent unintended pregnancy and support parenting or adoption. This approach respects moral diversity without turning personal crises into criminal cases.

### 74. Statement 22 (Score: 26)
Laws concerning abortion should aim to reduce tragedy: safeguard a person’s health and freedom to make private medical decisions, while acknowledging that many communities feel a duty to protect unborn life.

Prevention and support—sex education, contraception access, prenatal care, and economic help for families—are the most shared tools for lowering conflict and lowering abortion rates.

### 75. Statement 75 (Score: 25)
Laws concerning abortion should start from shared commitments to human dignity, patient safety, and honest recognition that pregnancy can involve urgent medical and family realities. A stable framework can protect timely, evidence-based care and privacy—especially in emergencies—while allowing democratically set, medically workable guardrails that reflect moral concern for developing life without criminalizing people in crisis. Broad agreement is most reachable when policy also reduces unwanted pregnancies through contraception access and accurate education, and strengthens supports for parents, children, and adoption.

### 76. Statement 7 (Score: 24)
Laws concerning abortion should be guided by a balance of compassion, responsibility, and clinical reality, recognizing that people disagree about moral status but often agree that crises should not be met with cruelty. That means clear protections for emergency and medically necessary care, no coercion or stigma, and practical guardrails that are transparent rather than political. The most durable approach pairs any legal framework with prevention and support—education, contraception, and resources for families—so fewer pregnancies become emergencies in the first place.

Common ground grows when policy also invests in prevention and support—education, contraception, prenatal care, and help for parents and adoption—so fewer pregnancies become crises.

### 78. Statement 99 (Score: 22)
Laws on abortion should aim to respect pluralism by preventing government from imposing a single moral doctrine while still taking seriously society’s interest in protecting life and health. A practical compromise centers patient–doctor decision-making, guarantees medically necessary care, and allows carefully defined limits later in pregnancy that do not block treatment for serious health risks or extreme circumstances. Broad prevention efforts and support for parents—healthcare, contraception, education, paid leave, and childcare—can unite people around fewer crises and more secure families.

### 79. Statement 19 (Score: 21)
Abortion policy should be guided by humility about hard cases, respect for conscience, and the practical need for clear medical standards that doctors can follow without delay.
