Politically they skew moderate-to-partisan (a mix of Democrats/liberals and Republicans/conservatives, with a visible environmentalist/Green streak), and their lifestyle is distinctly community- and nature-oriented (gardening, bird‑watching, volunteering, reading/arts, and “quiet” home-centered routines) with strong civic/education and conservation themes. | age: 66 / sex: Male / race: White alone / occupation category: Not applicable / political views: Republican / religion: Religiously Unaffiliated |
