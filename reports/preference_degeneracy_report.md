# Preference Profile Degeneracy Report

**Generated:** 2026-01-19 16:28:55

## Summary

A **degenerate** preference profile is one where voters have trivial rankings:
- **Sequential**: `[0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 99]` (alternatives ranked in index order)
- **Reverse**: `[99, 98, 97, ..., 0]` (alternatives ranked in reverse index order)

These rankings indicate the LLM failed to produce meaningful preference orderings.

### Overall Statistics

- **Total profiles analyzed:** 130
- **Average sequential ranking %:** 79.0%
- **Average degenerate (seq + rev) %:** 81.2%
- **Average unique rankings:** 19.4 / 100
- **Min unique rankings:** 6
- **Max unique rankings:** 32

## Legend

- 🔴 **Critical** (>80% degenerate): Most voters have trivial rankings
- 🟡 **Warning** (60-80% degenerate): Majority of voters have trivial rankings
- 🟢 **OK** (<60% degenerate): Less than majority have trivial rankings

**Note:** Even 'OK' profiles may still have significant degeneracy issues for experimental validity.
